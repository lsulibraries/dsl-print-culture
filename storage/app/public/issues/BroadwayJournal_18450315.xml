            <p>In prose satire done at random in our newspapers and other
               journals, we have been by no means, as a people, deficient,
               but in verse we are scarcely so much satirists as subjects
               for satire. We have had, to be sure, 
               <span class="person" id="fghalleck">Trumbull</span>'s clumsy
               "McFingal," 
               <span class="person" id="fghalleck">Halleck</span>'s "Croakers," the "Vision of Rubeta,"
               with its sequel, and one or two other similar things, inclusive
               of a late volume of poems by 
               <span class="person" id="wechanning">William Ellery Channing</span>,
               which we take to have been intended either for satire or burlesque, on the ground that it is impossible to comprehend
               them as any thing else. But beyond these works (each of
               which has its peculiar merits and defects,) we have really
               nothing to show a foreigner as a specimen of our satirical
               abilities done into verse.
            </p>
            
            <p>An ingenious friend at our elbow suggests that this deficiency arises from the want of a suitable field for satirical display. "In England," he says, "satire abounds, because the
               people find a proper target in the aristocracy, whom they (the
               people) regard as a distinct race of beings, with whom they
               have nothing in common; relishing even the most virulent
               abuse of the upper classes, with a gusto undiminished by any
               feeling that they (the people) have a personal concern in it.
               In Russia, or Austria, on the contrary," says our friend, "such
               a thing as satire is unknown; because it is dangerous to
               touch the aristocracy, and to satirise themselves would not
               exactly accord with the people's notions of either the decorous or expedient. It is the same thing" he continues "in
               America. Here the people who write are the people who read
               --and thus in satirizing the people we satirize only ourselves,
               and can feel no real sympathy in the satire."
            </p>
            
            <p>All this is more verisimilar than true. Our friend forgets
               that no individual ever considers himself as one of the mass.
               He, the individual, is the pivot--the immoveable and central
               pivot, on which all the rest of the world spins round. We
               may abuse the people by wholesale, and with a perfectly
               clear conscience, so far as regards any compunction for offending one single human being of the whole multitude
               of which that people is composed. Every one of the crowd
               will clap his hands lustily, and cry "encore ! give it to
               them, the poor miserable vagabonds! it serves them right."
               It seems to us, however, that we, here in America, have refused to encourage satire--not because what satire we have
               had, touches us too personally--but because what we have
               had has been too despicably namby-pamby to touch any body
               at all. This namby-pambyism, on the other hand, has arisen
               from the national sin of imitation--a sin perpetrated by all
               colonies upon the mother countries from which they spring.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>We content ourselves with doing what not only has been
               done before, but what (however well done) has been done ad
               nauseam. We should not be able to endure infinite repetitions
               of even absolute excellence in itself--but what is "McFingal" more than a faint echo from "Hudibras"--and what
               is the "Vision of Rubeta" but an illimitable gilded swilltrough overflowing with Dunciad and water? Let any vigorous, original, and fearless man of genius in America set himself to the task of composing a satire, and there will be no
               longer any complaints of the American deficiency in this respect, nor any need of transcendental reasons to account
               for it.
            </p>
            
            <p>We are led to these ideas by happening upon a copy of
               Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="pbenjamin">Benjamin</span>'s "Infatuation," which we have never had an
               opportunity of seeing before. It is not sufficiently pronounced in its object, to warrant us in classing it with "legitimate" satire; but there is enough in it, we think, to show
               conclusively that the author might succeed if he pleased in
               this class of writing, at least as well, if not very much better,
               than any of his countrymen who have preceded him. The
               poem is full of nerve, point, and terseness--the thrusts are
               dexterous and well aimed--and the versification peculiarly
               good of its kind. We have only to regret that the kind is not
               a more original kind than the hackneyed but undoubtedly
               forcible Iambic Petameter.
            </p>
            
            <p>We quote a few lines which embody not only some unusual pungencies of thought and expression, but some novel
               and very forcible rhythmical effects:

               <br></br>The Polka's poppies into vacant heads.
               
               <br></br>Asleep the Polka seems a tangled maze,
               
               <br></br>Awake the Polka prompts a hundred lays:
               
               <br></br>Polka the halls, the balls, the calls resound,
               
               <br></br>And Polka skims, Camilla-like, the ground.
               
               <br></br>Where roves in groves the nonsense-doating nymph,
               
               <br></br>And dreams by streams as smooth and clear as lymph,
               
               <br></br>Some leaf as brief as woman's love flits by,
               
               <br></br>And brings dear Polka to her pensive eye.
               
               <br></br>So in swift circles, backward, forward, wheeled,
               
               <br></br>The Polka's graces were at first revealed;
               
               <br></br>Perchance some posture-master, happy man,
               
               <br></br>From Nature drew the Polka's pretty plan.
               
               <br></br>Oh, wondrous figure, exquisitely stepp'd,
               
               <br></br>In thee who would not, should not be adept?

               <span class="person" id="eapoe">Poe</span>'s farther reply to the letter of OUTIS.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I shall not accuse Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="eapoe">Poe</span> of plagiarism," says 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span>,
               "for as I have observed before, such charges are perfectly
               absurd"--and 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> is certainly right in dwelling on the point
               that he has observed this thing before. It is the one original point of his essay--for I really believe that no one else
               was ever silly enough to "observe it before."
            </p>
            
            <p>Here is a gentleman who writes in certain respects as a
               gentleman should, and who yet has the effrontery to base a
               defence of a friend from the charge of plagiarism, on the
               broad ground that no such thing as plagiarism ever existed.
               I confess that to an assertion of this nature there is no little
               
               difficulty in getting up a reply. What in the world can a
               man say in a case of this kind?--he cannot of course give utterance to the first epithets that spring to his lips--and yet
               what else shall he utter that shall not have an air of direct
               insult to the common sense of mankind? What could any
               judge on any bench in the country do but laugh or swear at
               the attorney who should begin his defence of a petty-larceny
               client with an oration demonstrating   priori that no such
               thing as petty larceny ever had been, or in the nature of
               things, ever could be committed? And yet the attorney
               might make as sensible a speech as 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span>--even a more sensible one--any thing but a less sensible one. Indeed, mutato nomine, he might employ 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span>' identical words. He
               might say--"In view, gentlemen of the jury, of all the glaring improbabilities of such a case, a prosecuting attorney
               should be very slow to make such a charge. I say glaring
               improbabilities, for it seems to me that no circumstantial evidence could be sufficient to secure a verdict of theft in such
               a case. Look at it. [Here the judge would look at the
               maker of the speech.] Look at it. A man who aspires to
               (the) fame (of being a beau)--who seeks the esteem and
               praise of all the world (of dandies) and lives upon his reputation (for broadcloth) as his vital element, attempts to win
               his object--how? By stealing in open day the finest waistcoats, the most beautiful dress-coats (no others are worth
               stealing) and the rarest pantaloons of another, and claiming
               them as his own; and that too when he knows that every
               competitor for (the) fame (of Brummelism) and every fashion-plate Magazine in the world, as well as the real owner,
               will be ready to identify the borrowed plumes in a moment,
               and cry him down as a thief. A madman, an idiot, if he
               were capable of such an achievement, might do it, gentlemen of the jury, but no other."
            </p>
            
            <p>Now of course, no judge in the world whose sense of duty
               was not overruled by a stronger sense of the facetious, would
               permit the attorney to proceed with any such speech. It
               would never do to have the time of the court occupied by
               this gentleman's well-meant endeavour to show á priori, the
               impossibility of that ever happening which the clerk of this
               same court could show posteriori had been happening by wholesale ever since there had been such a thing as
               a foreign count. And yet the speech of the attorney was
               really a very excellent speech, when we compare it with that
               of 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span>. For the "glaring improbability" of the plagiarism,
               is a mere nothing by the side of the "glaring improbability"
               of the theft of the sky-blue dress-coat, and the yellow plaid
               pantaloons:--we may take it for granted, of course, that the
               thief was one of the upper ten thousand of thieves, and would
               not have put himself to the trouble of appropriating any garments that were not of indisputable ion ton, and patronised
               even by Professor 
               <span class="person" id="hwlongfellow">Longfellow</span> himself. The improbability
               of the literary theft, I say, is really a mere trifle in comparison with the broad-cloth larceny. For the plagiarist is either
               a man of no note or a man of note. In the first case, be is
               usually an ignoramus, and getting possession of a rather rare
               book, plunders it without scruple, on the ground that nobody
               has ever seen a copy of it except himself. In the second
               case (which is a more general one by far) he pilfers from
               some poverty-stricken, and therefore neglected man of genius,
               on the reasonable supposition that this neglected man of genius will very soon cut his throat, or die of starvation, (the
               sooner the better, no doubt,) and that in the mean time he
               will be too busy In keeping the wolf from the door to look
               after the purloiners of his property--and too poor, and too
               cowed, and for these reasons too contemptible, under any
               circumstances, to dare accuse of so base a thing as theft, the
               wealthy and triumphant gentleman of elegant leisure who
               has only done the vagabond too much honor in knocking him
               down and robbing him upon the highway.
            </p>
            
            <p>The plagiarist, then, in either case, has very reasonable
               ground for expecting impunity, and at all events it is because
               he thinks so, that he perpetrates the plagiarism--but how is
               it with the count who steps into the shop of the tailor, and
               slips under his cloak the sky-blue dress coat, and the yellow
               plaid pantaloons? He, the count, would be a greater fool in
               these matters than a count ever was, if he did not perceive at
               once, that the chances were about nine hundred and ninetynine to one, that he would be caught the next morning before
               twelve o'clock, in the very first bloom and blush of his promenade down Broadway, by some one of those officious individuals who are continually on the qui vive to catch the
               counts and take away from them their sky-blue coats and
               yellow plaid pantaloons. Yes, undoubtedly; the count is very
               well aware of all this; but he takes into consideration, that
               although the nine-hundred and ninety-nine chances are certainly against him, the one is just as certainly in his favor
               --that luck is every thing--that life is short--that the weather is fine--and that if he can only manage to get safely
               through his promenade down Broadway in the sky-blue dress
               coat and the yellow plaid pantaloons, he will enjoy the high
               honor, for once in his life at least, of being mistaken by fifteen ladies out of twenty, either for Professor 
               <span class="person" id="hwlongfellow">Longfellow</span>, or
               Phœbus Apollo. And this consideration is enough--the half
               of it would have been more than enough to satisfy the count
               that, in putting the garments under his cloak, he is doing a
               very sagacious and very commendable thing. He steals them,
               then, at once, and without scruple, and, when he is caught
               arrayed in them the next morning, he is, of course, highly
               amused to hear his counsel make an oration in court about
               the "glaring improbability" of his having stolen them when
               he stole them--by way of showing the abstract impossibility
               of their ever having been stolen at all.
            </p>
            
            <p>"What is plagiarism?" demands 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> at the outset, avec
               I'air d'un Romain qui sauve sa patrie--"what is plagiarism
               and what constitutes a good ground for the charge?"
            </p>
            
            <p>Of course all men anticipate something unusually happy
               in the way of reply to queries so cavernously propounded;
               but if so, then all men have forgotten, or no man has ever
               known that 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> is a Yankee. He answers the two questions by two others--and perhaps this is quite as much as
               any one should expect him to do. "Did no two men," he
               says, "ever think alike without stealing one from the other?
               --or thinking alike, did no two men ever use the same or
               similar words to convey the thoughts, and that without any
               communication with each other?--To deny it is absurd."

            <p>Of course it is--very absurd; and the only thing more absurd that I can call to mind at present, is the supposition that
               any person ever entertained an idea of denying it. But are
               we to understand the denying it, or the absurdity of denying
               it, or the absurdity of supposing that any person intended to
               deny it, as the true answer to the original queries?
            </p>
            
            <p>But let me aid 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> to a distinct conception of his own
               irrelevance. I accuse his friend, specifically, of a plagiarism.
               This accusation 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> rebuts by asking me with a grave face
               --not whether the friend might not, in this individual case, and
               in the compass of eight short lines, have happened upon ten
               or twelve peculiar identities of thought and identities of expression with the author from whom I charge him with plagiarising--but simply whether I do not admit the possibility
               that once in the course of eternity some two individuals
               might not happen upon a single identity of thought, and give
               it voice in a single identity of expression.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>Now, frankly, I admit the possibility in question, and
               would request my friends to get ready for me a strait-jacket
               if I did not. There can be no doubt in the world, for example, that 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> considers me a fool:--the thing is sufficiently
               plain: and this opinion on the part of 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> is what mankind have agreed to denominate an idea; and this idea
               is also entertained by Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jaldrich">Aldrich</span>, and by Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="hwlongfellow">Longfellow</span>
               --and by Mrs. Outis and her seven children--and by Mrs.
               Aldrich and hers--and by Mrs. Longfellow and hers-including the grand-children and great grand-children, if
               any, who will be instructed to transmit the idea in unadulterated purity down an infinite vista of generations yet to
               come. And of this idea thus extensively entertained, it
               would really be a very difficult thing to vary the expression in any material degree. A remarkable similarity would
               be brought about, indeed, by the desire of the parties in question to put the thought into as compendious a form as possible, by way of bringing it to a focus at once and having done
               with it upon the spot.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> will perceive, therefore, that I have every desire
               in the world to afford him that "fair play" which he considers "a jewel," since I admit not only the possibility of the
               class of coincidences for which he contends, but even the impossibility of there not existing just as many of these coincidences as he may consider necessary to make out his case.
            </p>
            
            <p>One of the species he details as follows, at some length:</p>
            
            <p>Some years ago, a letter was written from some part of New Eng
               land, describing one of those scenes, not very common during what is
               called "the January thaw," when the snow, mingled with rain, and
               freezing as it falls, forms a perfect covering of ice upon every object.
               The storm clears away suddenly, and the moon comes up. The letter
               proceeds--"every tree and shrub, at far as the eye can reach, of pure
               transparent glass--a perfect garden of moving, tracing, breathing chrystals. * * * Every tree is a diamond chandelier, with a whole constellation of stars clustering to every socket," &amp;c. This letter was
               laid
               away where such things usually are, in a private drawer, and did not
               see the light for many years. But the very next autumn brought out,
               among the splendid annuals got up in the country, a beautiful poem
               from Whittier, describing the same, or rather a similar scene, in
               which the line 
                    "The trees, like chrystal chandeliers,"
               was put in italics by every reviewer in the land, for the exceeding
               beauty of the imagery. Now the letter was written, probably, about
               the same time with the poem, though the poem was not published till
               nearly a year after.--The writers were not, and never have been, acquainted with each other, and neither could possibly have seen the
               Work of the other before writing. Now, was there any plagiarism
               here?"
            </p>
            
            <p>After the fashion of 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> himself I shall answer his query
               by another. What has the question whether the chandelier
               friend committed a plagiarism, to do with the question whether the Death-Bed friend committed a plagiarism, or whether it is possible or impossible that plagiarism, generally
               can be committed?
            </p>
            
            <p>But, merely for courtesy's sake, I step aside from the ex
               act matter in hand. In the case mentioned I should consider
               material differences in the terms of description as more remarkable than coincidences. Since the tree really looked
               like a chandelier, the true wonder would have been in likening it to anything else. Of course, nine common-place men
               out of ten would have maintained it to be a chandelier-looking tree. No poet of any pretension, however, would have
               committed himself so far as to put such a similitude in
               print. The chandelier might have been poetically likened
               to the chrystallized tree--but the converse is a platitude.
               The gorgeous unaltered handiwork of Nature is always degraded by comparison with the tawdry gew-gaws of Art-and perhaps the very ugliest thing in the world is a chandelier. If "every reviewer in the land put the passage into
               Italics on account of the exceeding beauty of the imagery,"
               then every printer's devil in the land should have been flogged for not taking it out of Italics upon the spot, and putting
               it in the plainest Roman--which is too good for it by one half.
            </p>
            
            <p>I put no faith in the nil admirari, and am apt to be amazed at every second thing which I see. One of the most
               amazing things I have yet seen, is the complacency with
               which 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> throws to the right and left his anonymous assertions, taking it for granted that because he (Nobody) asserts them, I must believe them as a matter of course. However--he is quite in the right. I am perfectly ready to admit
               anything that he pleases, and am prepared to put as implicit
               faith in his ipse dixit as the Bishop of Autun did in the Bible
               --on the ground that he knew nothing about it at all.
            </p>
            
            <p>We will understand it, then, not merely as an anonymous
               assertion but as an absolute fact, that the two chandelier authors "were not and never have been acquainted with each
               other, and that neither could have seen the work of the other
               before writing." We will agree to understand all this as indisputable truth, I say, through motives of the purest charity, for the purpose of assisting a friend out of trouble, and
               without reference to the consideration that no third person
               short of 
               <span class="person">Signor Blitz</span> or Professor 
               <span class="person">Rogers</span> could in any conceivable manner have satisfied himself of the truth of the
               twentieth part of it. Admitting this and every thing else,
               to be as true as the Pentateuch, it follows that plagiarism
               in the case in question was a thing that could not by any
               possibility be--and do I rightly comprehend 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> as demonstrating the impossibility of plagiarism where it is possible,
               by adducing instances of inevitable similarity under circumstances where it is not?
            </p>
            
            <p>The fact is, that through want of space and time to follow
               
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> through the labyrinth of impertinences in which he is
               scrambling about, I am constrained, much against my sense
               of decorum, to place him in the high-road of his argument,
               so that he may see where he is, and what he is doing, and
               what it is that he is endeavouring to demonstrate.
            </p>
            
            <p>He wishes to show, then, that Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="hwlongfellow">Longfellow</span> is innocent
               of the imitation with which I have charged him, and that
               Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jaldrich">Aldrich</span> is innocent of the plagiarism with which I have
               not charged him; and this duplicate innocence is expected
               to be proved by showing the possibility that a certain, or that
               any uncertain series of coincidences may be the result of pure
               accident.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now of course I cannot be sure that 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span> will regard my
               admission as a service or a disservice, but I admit the possibility at once; and not only this, but I would admit it as a
               possibility were the coincidences a billion, and each of the
               most definitive peculiarity that human ingenuity could conceive. But, in admitting this, I admit just nothing at all, so
               far as the advancement of 
               <span class="person" id="outis">Outis</span>' proper argument is concerned. The affair is one of probabilities altogether, and can be
               satisfactorily settled only by reference to their Calculus.
            </p>
            
            <p>I shall continue, if not conclude the subject in the next
               "Journal", and our readers may take it for granted that there
               will be some very "interesting developments" before I have
               done.

         </p>
         
         <p> The tendency of philosophy in the seventeenth century
            was towards abstraction and mysticism. The high-toned
            mind, when lifting itself above common things, cherished a
            contempt for the claims of ordinary humanity, and lost itself
            in the pure vacuum of abstract truth; while the restless and
            fanciful thinkers of the age, unable to imp their wings to so
            
            
            bold a flight, reached only to the cloudy regions of mysticism,
            and like the traveller on the Hartz mountains, beheld their
            own shadows magnified into giants by the fog.
         </p>
         
         <p>The progress of the human mind is onward, but it pursues
            a very winding way. Accordingly, we find the succeeding
            century marked by a spirit of analysis and scepticism;--nothing but demonstrable truth was received. The mind--the
            organ of intelligence, was alone called into exercise; while
            doubt was thrown upon the very existence of the soul; that
            dweller in the inner temple--that recipient and exponent of
            God's truth through consciousness.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the progress of the human intellect, we now behold
            another phase. The present is eminently the age of enquiry.
            Men speculate upon every thing; they seek to generalise all
            things. Every fact in nature, every truth in physics, is made
            the nucleus of a theory which, whether true or false, finds
            ready receivers. He who is content to satisfy his mind with
            the exact sciences, and his soul with trusting faith, is regarded as one who lingers last in the march of intellect.
         </p>
         
         <p>The habit of theorising upon every discovery in art or science, has given to the faculty of imagination, a much higher
            rank in the scale of mental power than philosophers of former times were willing to allow. In some men this faculty
            has all the power of a separate and distinct mind--a sort of
            "double" or ghost of the faculty of reason. Formerly men
            of imagination were poets, novelists, or painters, now we
            find them philosophers, metaphysicians and mechanicians.
            Once the highest province allotted to the imagination was
            the privilege of decorating truth; but now it often happens
            that while reason busies herself defining, arranging and
            combining some abstract theory, imagination is employed in
            analysing and assimilating the truths of science.
         </p>
         
         <p>But, as in former times, the spirit of analysis led by imperceptible gradation to scepticism, so it seems to me, that
            in modem days, the habit of generalization tends decidedly
            to materialism. Take, for instance, a book recently published, which for lucid arrangement and admirably sustained generalization, is unsurpassed by any work on the same subject : I mean "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation."
            It contains no new facts, but is filled with groups of facts,
            (so to speak) which come to us as new, because they appear
            so striking in their arrangement. The author is no materialist; on the contrary, he takes great pains to disclaim all
            such tendencies, yet what a storehouse of materialism would
            the book afford to one who doubted every truth which did
            not come through the intellect. His own faith in his theories
            adds an irresistible charm to his arguments, and it requires a
            most determined examination of truth to detect in many instances the workings of his imagination from the action of
            his reason. His system of progression has no limit short of
            Deity, and, notwithstanding the experience of thousands of
            years tells us that however the human mind may have
            advanced, the physical structure has known no other
            changes than such as are made by climate and modes of
            life, he talks of that perfect type of Divinity to which man
            may hereafter attain. Have we not already had in the incarnate Divinity the most perfect type of exalted humanity?
            Or can it be believed that when "God was made man and
            dwelt among us," he wore the semblance of an inferior humanity, which, to the noble race destined to succeed us, will
            seem as degraded in the scale of being as do the various
            tribes of Simia in comparison with the present race of mankind?
         </p>
         
         <p>In his theory of the geological and vegetable transformation, many discoveries in science seem to bear him out; and
            although facts might be adduced which would at least throw
            
            some doubts upon it, yet his picture of creation at the period
            of "carboniferous formation," is so sublime that we would
            fain believe it as true as it is grand. Its suggestiveness is
            positively overpowering. He has given us only a few noble
            strokes of the pencil, but it would require all the genius of a
            Milton to fill up the outlines he has traced. When he applies his system to animate nature, however, we feel its fallacy. The merest tyro in physiology can bring the most decided testimony against him. All the laws of nature (as they
            are called) prove the impossibility of generating superior
            races from inferior ones, or even of producing from the union
            of the two, a species capable of continuous reproduction. It
            may be answered that the Almighty, who made those laws,
            is superior to them; but this does not settle the question,
            since, if we believe in a departure from the laws of progression in a single instance, we may as well believe in the miracle of instantaneous creation.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is something frightful to feeble human nature, in
            the idea of necessity ruling with iron rod over earth's helpless children. How can we imagine heaven filled only by
            an infinite Intelligence to which we are but as atoms of dust
            on the rolling wheel of progression? A finite mind shrinks
            before such a fanciful truth. 
            <span class="person" id="jpaul">Jean Paul</span> has given us some
            idea of such a state of orphanage in his terrific "Dream."--
            His powerful imagination has carried the horrors of atheism
            into the world of spirits. He brings before us a vision of the
            souls of buried children, wandering blindly through a dark
            vague space, and calling vainly upon a heavenly Father,
            while the voice of the risen Christ mournfully replies, "we
            are all orphans--we have no Father in heaven."
         </p>
         
         <p>"He who first called God our Father, knew more of the
            human heart than the most profound thinkers of the age."
            The author of the "Vestiges," may well be classed among
            the profound thinkers. His book is one of great power, and
            greater suggestiveness, yet one of his readers at least closed
            the volume with a feeling of deep sadness. As I sat in my
            lonely room, pondering over its facts and fancies, my thoughts
            shaped themselves into the language of earnestness--which
            is poetry; and safe in my own insignificance, I thus spoke
            out:

         <p>I am--that is to say I was--a great man; but I am neither the author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my
            name, I believe, is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere
            in the city of Fum-Fudge.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose
            with both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius:--my father wept for joy and presented me with a
            
            treatise on Nosology. This I mastered before I was breeched.
         </p>
         
         <p>I now began to feel my way in the science; and soon came
            to understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently
            conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a
            Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories
            alone. Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls
            and swallowed a half dozen of drams.
         </p>
         
         <p>When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I
            would step with him into his study.
         </p>
         
         <p>"My son," said he, when we were seated, "what is the
            chief end of your existence?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"My father," I answered, "it is the study of Nosology."</p>
         
         <p>"And what, Robert," he inquired, "is Nosology?"</p>
         
         <p>"Sir," I said, "it is the Science of Noses."</p>
         
         <p>"And can you tell me," he demanded, "what is the meaning of a nose?"</p>
         
         <p>"A nose, my father," I replied, greatly softened, "has been
            variously defined by about a thousand different authors."
            [Here I pulled out my watch.] "It is now noon or thereabouts--We shall have time enough to get through with them
            all before midnight. To commence then:--The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that protuberance--that bump-that excrescence--that--" --"Will do, Robert," interrupted
            the good old gentleman. "I am thunderstruck at the extent
            of your information--I am positively--upon my soul."
            [Here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart.]
            "Come here!" [Here he took me by the arm.] "your education may now be considered as finished--it is high time
            you should scuffle for yourself--and you cannot do a better
            thing than merely follow your nose--so--so--so--" [Here
            he kicked me down stairs, and out of the door.]--"so get
            out of my house and God bless you!"
         </p>
         
         <p>As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this
            accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be
            guided by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my
            nose. I gave it a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology forthwith.
         </p>
         
         <p>All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.</p>
         
         <p>"Wonderful genius!" said the Quarterly.</p>
         
         <p>"Superb physiologist!" said the Westminster.</p>
         
         <p>"Clever fellow!" said the Foreign.</p>
         
         <p>"Fine writer!" said the Edinburgh.</p>
         
         <p>"Profound thinker!" said the Dublin.</p>
         
         <p>"Great man!" said Bentley.</p>
         
         <p>"Divine soul!" said Fraser.</p>
         
         <p>"One of us!" said Blackwood.</p>
         
         <p>"Who can he be?" said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.</p>
         
         <p>"What can he be?" said big Miss Bas-Bleu.</p>
         
         <p>"Where can he be?" said little Miss Bas-Bleu.--But I
            paid these people no attention whatever--I just stepped into
            the shop of an artist.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Duchess of Bless-my-soul was sitting for her portrait;
            the Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess' poodle
            the Earl of This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and
            his Royal Highness of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the
            back of her chair.
         </p>
         
         <p>I approached the artist and turned up my nose.</p>
         
         <p>"Oh, beautiful!" sighed her Grace.</p>
         
         <p>"Oh my!" lisped the Marquis.</p>
         
         <p>"Oh shocking!" groaned the Earl.</p>
         
         <p>"Oh abominable!" growled his Royal Highness.</p>
         
         <p>"What will you take for it?" asked the artist.</p>
         
         <p>"For his nose!" shouted her Grace.</p>
         
         <p>"A thousand pounds," said I, sitting down.</p>
         
         <p>"A thousand pounds?" inquired the artist, musingly.</p>
         
         
         <p>A thousand pounds," said I.</p>
         
         <p>"Do you warrant it?" he asked, turning the nose to the
            light.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I do," said I, blowing it well.</p>
         
         <p>"Is it quite original?" inquired he, touching it with reverence.</p>
         
         <p>"Humph!" said I, twisting it to one side.</p>
         
         <p>"Has no copy been taken?" he demanded, surveying it
            through a microscope.
         </p>
         
         <p>"None," said I, turning it up.</p>
         
         <p>"Admirable!" he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by
            the beauty of the manœuvre.
         </p>
         
         <p>"A thousand pounds," said I.</p>
         
         <p>"A thousand pounds? said he."</p>
         
         <p>"Precisely," said I.</p>
         
         <p>"A thousand pounds?" said he.</p>
         
         <p>"Just so," said I.</p>
         
         <p>"You shall have them," said he, "what a piece of virtu!"
            --So he drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch
            of my nose. I engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her
            Majesty the ninty-ninth edition of the "Nosology" with a
            portrait of the proboscis. That sad little rake, the Prince of
            Wales, invited me to dinner.
         </p>
         
         <p>We were all lions and recherch s.</p>
         
         <p>There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry,
            Iamblicus, Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius,
            and Syrianus.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgot, Price, Priestly, Condorcet, De Stael, and the "Ambitious
            Student in Ill Health."
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all
            fools were philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was  stheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and
            atoms; bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord;
            primitive intelligence and hom omeria.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius
            and Arianus; heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and
            consubstantialism; Homousios and Homouioisios.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He
            mentioned Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with velouté
            sauce; veal à la St. Menehoult; marinade à la St. Florentin;
            and orange jellies en mosäiques.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Bibulus O'Bumper. He touched upon Latour
            and Markbrünen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon
            Richbourg and St. George; upon Haubrion, Leonville,
            and Medoc; upon Barac and Preignac; upon Grave, and upon
            St. Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told,
            with his eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of Cimbabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino--of
            the gloom of Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the
            colors of 
            <span class="person">Titian</span>, of the frows of 
            <span class="person">Rubens</span>, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University.
            He was of opinion that the moon was called Bendis in
            Thrace, Bubastis in Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in
            Greece.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not
            help thinking that the angels were horses, cocks and bulls;
            that somebody in the sixth heaven had seventy thousand
            heads; and that the earth was supported by a sky-blue cow
            with an incalculable number of green horns.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had
            become of the eighty-three lost tragedies of  schylus; of the
            fifty-four orations of Is us; of the three hundred and ninety
            
            one speeches of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises
            of Theophrastus; of the eighth book of the Conic Sections of
            Apollonius; of Pindar's hymns and dithyrambics; and of the
            five and forty tragedies of Homer Junior.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed
            us all about internal fires and tertiary formations; about
             eriforms, fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl;
            about schist and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc
            and calc; about blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate
            and pudding-stone; about cyanite and lepidolite; about
            h matite and tremolite; about antimony and calcedony;
            about manganese and whatever you please.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was myself. I spoke of myself;--of myself, of myself, of myself;--of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up my nose and spoke of myself.</p>
         
         <p>"Marvellous clever man!" said the Prince.</p>
         
         <p>"Superb!" said his guests; and next morning her Grace
            of Bless-my-soul paid me a visit.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Will you go to Almacks, pretty creature?" she said,
            tapping me under the chin.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Upon honor," said I.</p>
         
         <p>"Nose and all?" she asked.</p>
         
         <p>"As I live," I replied.</p>
         
         <p>"Here then is a card, my life, shall I say you will be
            there?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Dear Duchess, with all my heart."</p>
         
         <p>"Pshaw, no !--but with all your nose?"</p>
         
         <p>"Every bit of it my love," said I:--so I gave it a twist or
            two and found myself at Almacks.
         </p>
         
         <p>The rooms were crowded to suffocation.</p>
         
         <p>"He is coming!" said somebody on the staircase.</p>
         
         <p>"He is coming!" said somebody farther up.</p>
         
         <p>"He is coming!" said somebody farther still.</p>
         
         <p>"He is come!" exclaimed the Duchess--"he is come, the
            little love!"--and seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice upon the nose.
         </p>
         
         <p>A marked sensation immediately ensued.</p>
         
         <p>"Diavolo!" cried Count Capricornutti.</p>
         
         <p>"Mille tonnerres ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.</p>
         
         <p>"Tousand teufel!" growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.</p>
         
         <p>This was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short
            upon Bluddennuff.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Sir," said I, "you are a baboon."</p>
         
         <p>"Sir," he replied, after a pause, "Donner und Blitzen."</p>
         
         <p>This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards.
            At Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose--and
            then called upon my friends.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Bile!" said the first.</p>
         
         <p>"Fool!" said the second.</p>
         
         <p>"Dolt!" said the third.</p>
         
         <p>"Ass!" said the fourth.</p>
         
         <p>"Ninny!" said the fifth.</p>
         
         <p>"Noodle!" said the sixth.</p>
         
         <p>"Be off!" said the seventh.</p>
         
         <p>At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.</p>
         
         <p>"Father," I said, "what is the chief end of my existence?"</p>
         
         <p>"My son," he replied, "it is still the study of Nosology;
            but in shooting off the Elector's nose you have overshot
            your mark. You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none. You are damned, and he has become the
            hero of the day. I grant you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis--
            but, Good Heavens ! there is no competing with a lion who
            has no proboscis at all."

         <p>I have heard it regretted by a painter, whose acknowledged abilities should have taught him better, that he had
            not the pigments wherewith fully to represent nature, forgetting that if his wish for infinite means were granted, he
            with his limited capacities could no more wield them, than
            an infant the club of Hercules; indeed, until we have outstripped all that has gone before us in Art, we have no right to
            call for more, when even now, we waste so large a proportion of what we have. It seems to have been the opinion of
            Titian, who was well qualified to judge in the matter, from a
            saying recorded in his life, that his countrymen, "the Venetian painters, would have colored much better if yellow (pigment) had been as plenty as common earth, and white as
            scarce and dear as gold," that even in that school of painting
            most skilled in the use of colors, and famous therefor throughout the world, even more limitation of means, rather than increase, would have been attended with advantage. If in his
            time and country this was true, how much truer must it be
            now, when we have some colors of such intensity that artists
            by common consent throw them aside, from their very brightness, as useless, and yet complain of their limited means.
            Let any painter have learned so to use what he has, that in
            a landscape of his painting there shall breathe an atmosphere
            of morning, noon, or evening, such as Claude's never lack, the
            waters limpid, clear and glittering as a mirror, the leaves of
            his trees reflecting on their glossy surfaces the light of the
            sky as well as the rich deep colors of the earth, and suffering the sky-light to shine through them, as in nature--their
            branches spreading wide, with atmosphere of light seen to
            float between the nearer and farther parts, so that a bird
            might not there seem to spread his wings in vain, in that not
            quite empty space, and we shall hear no more calling out for
            aid--we shall then have true art, such as has ever won the
            admiration of mankind, and need but to be again given to our
            eyes to fill them with tears of delight. But before this can
            be done, we must ask well the why, and how--we must
            peer into things, not skim the mere surface--we need to see
            through the subject; if we would paint a flower, we must
            well consider how its rosy hue differs in its qualities from all
            other colors called rosy; if it seem to have moisture in it, or
            is dry to the vision; and when we have learned to see wherein one substance differs from another in either its local or accidental color, or absorbing, or throwing off of light, from its
            surface; it will go hard, but we shall find a means to represent it that no eye can mistake it for what it is not intended
            to be. For the different applications of pigments can be
            made to imitate equally well all qualities that the eye discerns in things, as these opposites, wet and dry, hard and
            soft, transparent and opaque, rough and smooth, &amp;c., &amp;c., as
            well as the different modifications and combinations of these
            in different degrees and relations: for instance, the look of
            wetness on silks or satins, of whatever color; and dryness
            and absorbency, in woollen cloths; the dry look of sky or atmosphere, and the wet look of its reflection in water. This
            wetness may always be produced by glazing with transparent color, and dryness by its opposite, by what is called
            scumbling, that is, passing an opaque color thinly over another.
         </p>
         
         <p>Something of wetness is also produced by using even
            opaque colors considerably thinned with oil, so that when
            used they somewhat melt, as it were, together. This is a
            very common mode with our painters, whether the substance
            to be imitated be clouds, flesh, metals, or even a dry dusty
            road--where its application is about as efficient as that of
            the old lady's broom, who wanted "to sweep the cob-webs
            from the sky indeed, if we were gravely told that she did
            so, and were also told that these painters do well, the one and
            the other would be equally credible. It would not be very
            astonishing if some of these artists were discovered to be
            the actual descendants of this identical old lady, and who
            
            have inherited an ambition as laudable as her own, which
            will not suffer them to pause or rest until they have brushed
            away, not only the "cobwebs" but nature's entire self from
            their canvass, if not from the face of the earth. "Nature
            puts them out," and if in their turn, they put out nature, why
            not? She never did them any good.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is nothing mean or trivial in nature, where all
            things know and keep their proper places, where all things
            are grand or beautiful. It is when the misnamed artist
            tears it from its proper relation and throws it into a chaos
            of his own creation, or holds it up mutilated, and shorn
            of all its beams, before us, that any true quality becomes
            disgusting. He who has a true sense of art, will take wide
            views in nis imitations of nature, not forgetting that this relation of one quality to another, is the very essence of what
            he can learn from a study of nature; he will not allow one
            quality to usurp the place of another, but keep all within
            the limits wherein alone they can be beautiful. He will not,
            as the French painters do, sacrifice harmony to relief--which
            is the product of contrast, or like them degrade an expression
            of enthusiasm, by painting it in the face of one engaged in
            manufacturing a "leetle boot," but give to an eagle the
            wings of an eagle, and to a lobster his claws. If therefore,
            we would paint gold, it should look solid--if flesh, it should
            not be glass, or rose-leaves, but seem to possess all we know
            of flesh--not forgetting the very down spread every where
            on its surface. Let no painter flatter himself that he can dispense with any of these, that men's eyes will be so grossly
            deceived as to accept less than all: if they do so deceive themselves, the painter will be the greater sufferer. This has
            been the rock on which modern Art has split--that it was to
            be attained by some other means than imitation. The English by making pleasing combinations of colors, and tight and
            dark, without reference to the imitation of natural objects.
            The French by clothing heroes and clowns in the cast-off forms
            of the antique. The Germans, by imitating the puerile attempts of the Italians, previous to the time of Leonardo da
            Vinci.--And we, in a medley of all these. All would storm
            Art--and all choose the side away from Nature, not knowing
            that the same gate through which those who have ever
            reached the citadel of Art, stands now wide open to all who
            seek it in that path which lies right through the very heart
            of Nature. If any doubt this, let them look back to those
            early works of Italy to which I have referred, and see how
            simply those men begun. If they would paint the early history of Moses--what did they do I why they designed their
            pictures in every thing directly from the people about them,
            to their very clothes. The fall of Ninevah they painted from
            their own cities, and in this child-like way that Art begun
            to be developed, which afterwards found such noble advancement by the genius of Raffaelle, equally indebted to nature for his "Divine." The Venetian, the Dutch, the Spanish--Murillo's Peasants and Beggars--undoubtedly his best
            pictures, and painted before he left Spain--all these and
            whatever else the world has seen in Art, worthy to e so
            called, is just that which each could with his powers translate from nature into his pictures; and because your eyes cannot find in Nature what your eyes are taught to see in the
            works of Raffaelle, will you say that it is not there and never was? Can you see the character and expression in nature
            that is found in the works of the wonderful 
            <span class="person">Hogarth</span>? Yes?
            well this will only prove that you are nearer to 
            <span class="person">Hogarth</span> than
            to Raffaelle, and no more. But you must be indeed blind if
            you cannot see in Nature as great beauty as any that 
            <span class="person">Raffaelle</span>
            has given us, if not the same. It is the littleness of the man,
            that makes any truth a trifle,--to the Great all truth is Grand,
            and the love of Nature and its true worship must go before
            all who would travel far or profitably. Who has painted the
            best portraits of individuals? The greatest painters, 
            <span class="person">Raffaelle</span> and Titian-and why? if not because they could best imitate what was set before them. Did they leave any thing
            out? Yes. and why? Because they could not paint it all;
             and therefore chose that which to them seemed the truest
            characteristics of their sitters--and imitated them--and yet
            take away the color from the portraits of the one, and the
            expression from the other, and will much be left? The best
            History painters must always paint the best portraits, for it
            is through the one that they attain the other--and it is by
            no means a matter of wonder that 
            <span class="person" id="pbenjamin">Benjamin</span> West's Great
            Pictures are so meagre if what 
            <span class="person" id="whazlitt">Hazlitt</span> says of them be true,
            "that there is not in all his works, one truly fine head,"-and so far as my observation of his works goes it is undeniable.

         <div class="biblPage">167</div>
         
         <div class="head">THE DIGNITY OF TAILORS.</div>
         
         <p>The editor of the "Mirror of Fashion" quotes the quizzica
            essay on the ӕsthetics of dress from Blackwood's Magazine
            with great unction, and grandly remarks, "we are pleased to
            notice the growing favor with which our profession is regarded by writers of mark in both hemispheres."
         </p>
         
         <p>This is very fine. It evinces a proper esprit de corps. The
            man who will not stick up for his profession will never stick
            to it. The reason why the profession of a maker of coats and
            trousers should be accounted less dignified than the profession of a maker of any thing else for the comfort or convenience of mankind, we never have been able to answer, or
            get answered in a satisfactory manner. Not only do other
            artisans affect a contempt for tailors, but even men who do
            nothing at all, and ignominiously live upon the produce of
            other people's labors, speak sneeringly of tailors, while indebted to them for all their consequence. If Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="gcscott">Scott</span>, the
            editor of the Mirror of Fashion, uses his shears with as much
            precision and grace as he wields his pen, we should have no
            hesitation in submitting to his operations in the important
            matter of a fit. We copy the remainder of Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="gcscott">Scott</span>'s remarks without the smallest particle of resentment, on account
            of the vigor with which he presses upon the press. His defence
            of the editor of another "Mirror" is handsomely done, and
            gives a fine chivalresque tone to his article. But as poor Nick
            Biddle once said, when he had the Bank at his command, it
            is the privilege of strength not to be afraid of doing right; Mr.
            
            <span class="person" id="gcscott">Scott</span> should not press so hard upon poor writers; it cannot be
            the destiny of every man to dress well, and it should not be
            forgotten that an author may carry a good heart underneath
            a thread-bare vest.
         </p>
         
         <p>"What a great pity it is, on account of the Trade, that writers are
            generally so poverty-stricken as not to be able to wear good clothes;
            but how puerile do the ekings of their weakness appear in venting
            them against the Tailor, instead of the fiat which made them creatures with minds capable of connecting ideas. It is the universal poverty of writers of mark, which has called down upon the head of our
            esteemed fellow-citizen, 
            <span class="person" id="npwillis">N. P. Willis</span>, the abuse of the newspaper
            press in several instances,--until they have become surprised to learn,
            that the imputation of "not paying tailors' bills" cannot be applied to
            him with impunity; and we are heartily glad to note the fact, for he
            is about the only person in our country capable of writing an intelligible article on the subject of dress. Even 
            <span class="person" id="hhweld">H. Hastings Weld</span>, Esq., preferred employing us to write articles in that line, expressing himself
            wholly incompetent to the task; and if he--one of the best essayists
            in the country--acknowledged this fact, is it to be wondered at, that it
            is not one of the topics of newspaper literature in the country? Surely
            not Editors generally are utilitarians, write because they must, and the
            tonics with which they make themselves acquainted are those which
            pay and as much as ever they make themselves capable of doing justice to these; which furnishes ample reason for the field of fashion
            being left undescribed by the great mass of writers who have sprung up
            through poverty from obscurity, leaving it solely to those who were
            supported with more ease and elegance during their school days, or
            such as have talents of the most brilliant and peculiar orders.
         </p>
         
         <p>From these facts, it is not to be wondered at if writers generally,
            through envy, contribute their mite to our prejudice in the social scale
            of being: yet this truth remains secure, that the inditing of new and peculiar sentiments, and drafting an outre garment, are dictated by the
            same quality of impulse, whether of ingenuity or enthusiasm. There is
            no business requiring sentiments so near akin with the poetical, as ours.
            We do not--With the painter or sculptor--imitate nature, but we create
            anew or change her appearance. Thus we conclude that the taste in
            the selection of ideas and the mode of dressing them, requires a similar exercise of the mind with that which produces a new style of person
            by a peculiar change in the formation of his dress.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="gcscott">Scott</span>'s comparison of the poet, the painter, and the
            tailor, is in the highest style of art. It is not exactly like the
            parallel between poetry and painting by 
            <span class="person" id="jdryden">Dryden</span>, but it is
            something like it inasmuch as there is a parallel in each case.
            That is a fine artistic touch upon the poor devil author, which
            ascribes want of fashionable knowledge in the "great mass
            of writers" to the fact that they "have sprang up through
            poverty from obscurity." The great mass of them, we fear,
            have rather "sprang" down through "poverty to obscurity"
            than up.

         <div class="ab">Dear 
            <span class="person">Hughey</span>.
         </div>
         
         <p>I cannot express to you how sensibly I felt the kindness which prompted somebody,
            I
            need not say who, to send me a draft for a
            hundred pounds, when my wilful absence from home had, I will confess to you,
            deprived me of any right to expect even a sum much less than
            that. But let me ask you, 
            <span class="person">Hughey</span>, why did anybody dare to take this liberty with
            me? how did they know that I would not resent it as an
            affront, and---But you are laughing at my folly, I know. However, wait until I
            return to Bold street, and then see who will laugh. In the
            mean time let us laugh at something else, if we can.
         </p>
         
         <p>The draft was on a famous banking-house in Wall street, which is the money-centre
            of
            the New World. You have heard of Wall street,
            even in Pool lane, I dare say, and you have doubtless figured in your mind some
            such place as Castle street or St. George's crescent. But
            never were two places more unlike. There is an exchange, and a church, and banking
            houses and brokers' offices in each, to be sure, but
            they are not at all alike for all that. The buildings in Wall street are huge
            incongruous masses of stone, destitute alike of ornament and
            symmetry. The Exchange is a vast heap of granite with a facade formed of impossible
            stone columns, which would make king Cheops open
            his eyes if he were ever to walk this way during his metempsychosis. You ascend to
            the principal room by a flight of steps some twenty
            feet high, which occasions a dreadful waste of time. How it happened that the New
            York merchants, who are proverbial for their economy
            of time, should commit such a blunder as to place their bourse at an almost
            inaccessible height, is quite past an ordinary comprehension.
            But 
            <span class="person">Franklin Myrtle</span> says his countrymen invariably lose their senses, and
            perpetrate all manner of absurdities, whenever they meddle with
            architecture. A gentleman who is famous for his calculations told me that a New
            York merchant loses every year at least thirty-two hours
            in ascending and descending the steps of the Exchange. The great room is indeed a
            great room,--a rotunda, lighted by a lantern in the
            roof, and surrounded by huge marble pillars, without capitals, which were brought
            in blocks from Italy. The walls are stuccoed, and are
            entirely destitute of ornament. It is the coldest, most barren-looking interior,
            that I have ever seen. I think that there can be but few lively
            bargains struck in such a cheerless cavern. A few stalactites pendant from the ceiling,
            or even a charcoal drawing on the walls, would deprive it in a degree of its desolate aspect. In an upper room
            of the same building is the Board of Brokers, where the
            stock dealers meet every day to make their purchases and
            sales. The stock jobbers are a lawless band, who give a
            practical illustration of the follies of mercantile law, which
            steps in between two private parties and deprives them of
            the liberty of settling their own bnsiness in their own way.
            A merchant fails in business, and the law comes to his aid;
            suits and assignments follow, he is sent to Coventry himself, his creditors get nothing, but some lawyer gets all.
            When a broker fails, the law cannot touch him, he disposes
            of his effects to the best advantage, compounds with his
            creditors to their satisfaction, and in twenty-four hours is a
            whole man again--at least I am told so; of course I know
            nothing about the matter.
         </p>
         
         <p>As we walked through Wall street, 
            <span class="person">Frank</span> told me a good
            many strange stories about different individuals, whom we
            met frisking past us with long marble-covered books under
            their arms, for Frank was a denizen of Wall street once
            himself;--how one gentleman with very long legs and a
            starched cravat, imported his desserts (not his deserts,)
            from Paris, and how another, who had made a million in a
            few weeks, ate nothing but p t s-de-foie-gras while his million lasted, which was but a month or two, and had hardly
            been able to procure a mutton chop since. Among other
            things, he told me of an acquaintance of his who, a few
            weeks before, had lost his senses together with every thing
            that he was worth, and that one of the unfortunate man's
            creditors opened a subscription for him which his other creditors swelled up to a sum sufficient to put him on his legs
            again, and restore him to his reason. This must give you
            a high opinion of the Wall street brokers, as it did me j and
            you would like to see one of them. Well, 
            <span class="person">Frank</span> shall sketch
            you a specimen. It is an easy thing to give a specimen of a
            geological formation, but not so easy to give a specimen of
            a stratum of society, because it takes a great many indi.
            viduals to make one general character. The Jewish race
            predominate in Wall street, but it requires an amalgation of
            Jew and 
            <span class="person">Gentile</span> to make up a genuine Wall street character; so you see what a difficult task it will be for my artist
            friend, but he will succeed, I have no doubt.
         </p>
         
         <p>I have only space enough for Frank--so, once more, I
            subscribe myself your friend, and resign the pen to him.

               <br></br>I've seen her at morning all laughing and gay,
               
               <br></br>With the step of a fairy bewitching Broadway;
               
               <br></br>I've seen her at evening all jewels and plumes,
               
               <br></br>Outflashing the gas In the brilliantest rooms.
               
               <br></br>They may talk of Circassia and sing of Cashmere,
               
               <br></br>Where the maids are so fair and the shawls are so dear;
               
               <br></br>But for elegant figures deliciously drest,
               
               <br></br>The East cannot rival our land of the West.
               
               <br></br>And the belle of all belles is the belle of Broadway:
               
               <br></br>She's as plump as a Venus and light as a fay;
               
               <br></br>Her smile--oh ! what rapture its sweetness bestows,
               
               <br></br>While the blush of her cheek shames the blush of a rose!
               
               <br></br>If my pen were a diamond whose sparkles would flow
               
               <br></br>Like the lightning's swift gleam to the paper below,
               
               <br></br>By the dazzle of words I might hope to convey
               
               <br></br>Some glance at the charms of the belle of Broadway.
               
               <br></br>But Sully himself would resign in despair
               
               <br></br>The pencil that pictures the fairest of fair,
               
               <br></br>Nor attempt in his exquisite style to pourtray
               
               <br></br>The perfection of grace in the belle of Broadway!

            NAVIGATION.

         <p>President 
            <span class="person">J. J. Mapes</span> in the Chair; 
            <span class="person">C. L. Barritt</span>, Acting Secretary.
         </p>
         
         <p>The idea of navigating the air seems to have been known
            to the ancients, if we believe the many fabulous stories of
            flying. 
            <span class="person" id="strabo">Strabo</span> says that a people of Scythia had a means of
            elevating themselves in the air by means of smoke, though
            it is not mentioned in what manner, or whether by any of the
            mechanical contrivances which have since been in use.
            Montgolfier of France, however, in his first experiments used
            smoke, and may possibly have obtained his ideas of ballooning from this remark of 
            <span class="person" id="strabo">Strabo</span>'s.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <span class="person" id="rbacon">Roger Bacon</span>, in his "De Mirabili Potestate, &amp;c," makes
            particular mention of a flying machine, and says that he
            knows the name of the inventor, though he had not seen the
            machine. What this machine could have been, it is impossible to imagine. It is hardly possible that it had any shape
            or form, other than in the speculation of that great man. For
            it is not improbable that it might have been an original idea
            with him, but put forth in this manner to avoid the terrors of
            the church and the vulgar, who looked upon him and his
            many discoveries as something super-human, and a little bit
            as if in too close league with the devil. That this vulgar
            prejudice had its influence there can be no doubt, and to
            have advanced a theory so bold as that of flying, at that early
            date, would have been rather too much of the marvellous for
            the safety of the projector.
         </p>
         
         <p>The only real project for a balloon, however, was that of
            the Jesuit 
            <span class="person" id="flanaterzi">Francis Lana</span>, in 1670. In his plan he proposed
            to use metal globes, made very thin, and exhausted of the
            air. The specific gravity of these globes, being much less
            than the surrounding atmosphere, must necessarily cause
            them to rise. It in fact was the only rational project ever
            suggested, and on which Montgolfier based his experiments.
            The use of hydrogen gas, which had been discovered by
            
            <span class="person">Cavendish</span>, was tried, but that gas being so light and escaping
            so rapidly, was found impracticable. Their (the brothers
            Montgolfiers') experiments with rarified air, created by means
            of a fire underneath the balloon, was the first successful experiment ever made. Air has a power of buoyancy equal to
            fifteen pounds to the square inch, and is capable of expanding
            at a temperature of 212°, or boiling heat, to 37.5 parts its
            bulk at 32° temperature. The ascension of Montgolfier's
            balloon was caused by this expansion of the air in the balloon,
            which, like a cork in water, being the lighter substance, rises
            to the top. The specific gravity of hydrogen gas is .058; oliphant gas, .980; oil gas, on an average, .900, and atmospheric
            .1000. Hydrogen gas being the lightest gas known, therefore is best adapted for balloon navigation, if it could be retained; oiled silk, the usual substance for balloons, being not
            sufficiently impervious to the escape of that gas. A globe
            of air, at the surface of the sea weighs 1.25 lbs. avoirdupois,
            and hydrogen is six times lighter. A sphere, therefore, of hydrogen, 12 feet in diameter, would rise with a force of 57 lbs.,
            and one of 24 feet diameter, with eight times the force--or,
            456 lbs. The weight of the material, of which the balloon
            is made, of course, would have to be deducted from the upward pressure of the atmosphere. This bulk of the gas is
            taken at the pressure of the atmosphere at the surface of
            the earth. Atmosphere, at an elevation of about three miles,
            expands to double its bulk, or at 15,740 feet elevation--some
            8000 feet less elevation than was attained by M. Gay Lussac.
            This difference in the pressure would cause a balloon to burst
            if filled with gas at the surface of the earth, and not allowed to escape as it ascended into a rarer medium.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. 
            <span class="person">Green</span>, in his experiments, used coal gas, or carburetted hydrogen, in his balloon, when he crossed the English
            channel; it being less penetrating than pure hydrogen. His
            balloon was up some eighteen or twenty hours. In some of
            his more recent experiments on the powers of retaining carburetted hydrogen gas, he has had balloons suspended in the
            air for weeks. The experiments to apply machinery to direct the balloon, and to overcome the currents of air at great
            altitudes, have never been successful. All balloons are at the
            mercy of the winds. The muscular power of birds, shows
            conclusively that the power required to move in the air, or
            to fly, is so great over that of the size of the , bird, that no
            machine ever could be built, that could carry, suspended in
            
            
            the air, machinery enough to propel it--as the size of the
            bird is to the muscular power of its wings, no machine on
            land could be made. The buoyancy of air being so well
            known, and the gravity of iron and wood, materials of which
            any machinery must be built, equally as well known, it is
            an easy calculation to say how far ballooning would succeed
            for practical purposes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Signor Muzzi's balloon exhibiting in this city is the most
            perfect specimen of a balloon ever made. It is the nearest
            to success; as a mere model in a still atmosphere, and for
            the length of a room, it may succeed, though on an enlarged scale, it would probably be a failure, so far as the application of his invention is concerned. The balloon is a
            sphere, with the ends flattened--on each flattened side are
            two large wings, which can be adjusted to certain inclinations,
            as we may desire, for ascending and descending; on the periphery, or the greatest diameter of the sphere, between the
            wings, he has a tail, also working by means of pulleys, to
            direct the balloon, as birds with their wings when flying. The
            experiments, thus far, have shown that he can proceed by
            changing the inclination of his wings, so that as he rises, by
            force of the gas, the pressure of the atmosphere on the inclined surface of the wings, will shoot him ahead at an angle
            of about forty-five degrees elevation, and by changing the
            inclination of the wings, a similar downward movement
            takes place, not unlike the undulating movements of the
            chipping bird, except that the motion is in straight lines. This
            motion can be varied from right to left, like a ship beating
            against a head wind, though it cannot come nearer the wind
            than about eight points of the compass. To maintain an elevation, it is proposed to prepare wood, so as always to have
            a supply of hydrogen. His mode of preparing the wood, is by
            kyanizing: the sap is exhausted from the capillary tubes, and
            immediately plunged in alcohol, which, under the pressure of
            the atmosphere, rushes into the tubes, and thus saturates or
            charges the wood with the liquid. To preserve it from evaporation, it is coated with wax, &amp;c., and as it is wanted, is
            burned; the hydrogen of the alcohol being used for replenishing the gas. As an experiment, it is ingenious, and
            Signor Muzzi deserves great credit for the experiment-though the numerous contingencies upon balloon navigation,
            makes it highly improbable that it will ever be equal to
            steam. Hydrogen gas is too difficult to use, and carburetted
            hydrogen could not be replenished, even could the mechanical difficulties be overcome.

         <p>When the great green bird beheld this dove, it shivered as
            though struck with mortal fear, and letting go the king's
            arm, flew away as fast as it could, uttering prolonged and
            doleful shrieks. The little dove started at once in chase, and
            the king perceived as his eyes followed its flight, that it grew
            larger and larger with every beat of its wings, and that its
            form Was changing with its size, so that presently it was a
            noble eagle in shape as well as dimensions. It was soon
            close to the monster, which finding itself about to be overtaken, soared suddenly upward as if seeking refuge in a
            higher region. Its brave adversary followed, and the king
            rode forward till he was beneath them in order to witness
            the struggle. Up they went till each became a speck upon
            the clear blue sky, when they closed with a clashing of beaks
            and talons, which the king in his excited fancy even thought
            he heard. The combat was brief as it was fierce. In a few
            moments the birds were coming down faster than they went
            up, and the king with great joy presently beheld the greep
            monster tumbling dead to the earth, while the eagle, which
            had not quitted its hold of the carcass till near the ground,
            swept triumphantly in a circle thrice around his head, then
            alighting at his side, changed at once into the fairy, and looked him in the face with the same serene aspect that bad
            cheered his heart when she rose from the well.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Again I owe you my life, divine fairy I" exclaimed the
            king when his astonishment had subsided, "and wonderful
            was the manner of its preservation. But I am burning with
            curiosity to know why you left me at so perilous a juncture,
            and why you came to my rescue in such singular guise?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Know first, O king, that yonder carcass when it sought thy destruction, was animated,
            not by the life of a bird but by
            the spirit of a most wicked and powerful genie, who had assumed that form, the better to work his evil will and that of
            his master, 
            <span class="person">Arphaxad</span> the Egyptian, who sent him against
            thee. When thy watchful eye discovered his approach and
            thwarted his plan of crushing thee, I felt that my own strength
            was unable to cope with his, and not daring to venture an
            uncertain struggle, trusted to thy courage to keep him at
            bay for a moment, while, with the speed that fairies alone
            possess, I flew to my sister on Mount Atlas, and obtained the
            holy form of a dove, by which I knew he would be put to
            flight. Weakened as he then was by terror and the loss of
            blood, it was easy with the shape and strength of an eagle
            to complete his overthrow and drive him bodiless back to
            his master."
         </p>
         
         <p>"He is not dead, then?" said the king, looking around a little anxiously.</p>
         
         <p>"There is no life in the bird," replied the fairy, "but that
            genie belongs to an immortal race. His strength, however,
            is broken for a time, and it will be long ere he again assails you; indeed, he never will if you lastly abide in my
            counsels."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Then, indeed, he never will I" exclaimed Abdallah with
            enthusiasm--"but tell me, O fairy, why cannot you conduct me to the presence of your sister with as much speed
            as you but now went thither? I am impatient to behold
            such majesty and loveliness as she must possess."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Be contented," answered the fairy, "your progress is as
            great as is good for you. Time and space you cannot transcend as I do, and you have much yet to encounter, much
            to overcome, before you reach my sister's blessed city."
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a slight severity in the fairy's tone as she said
            this, so that the king judged it best to suppress the answer
            which rose to his tongue.
         </p>
         
         <p>They had now resumed their journey, and for some hours
            went on together in silence. Night approached, but the adventures of this eventful day were not yet concluded. As
            the sun was setting 
            <span class="person">Abdallah</span> perceived a damsel, mounted
            on a dromedary, coming swiftly towards them from the north.
            As she drew nigh he saw that she was gaily attired, and had
            a handsome, smiling countenance. She looked at him very
            intently, and he returned her gaze with eagerness, for besides
            that he was amazed at her appearance in the lonely desert,
            there was something very fascinating in her face.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Turn away your eyes from her," said the fairy sternly,
            "she is false and evil--every glance is fraught with terrible
            danger."
         </p>
         
         <p>For the first time the king was disobedient. He could not
            restrain his eyes from following the fair stranger as she passed across their track. He was still gazing, when, apparently
            by accident, her dromedary stumbled, and she was thrown
            upon the sand. Putting spurs to his horse, the king was
            rushing forward to her assistance, when he felt upon the
            back of his head a sensation which seemed as if caused by a
            volume of hot, thick air, suddenly impelled against it. Turning, he beheld a prodigious serpent, from whose throat came
            the breath he felt, and whose jaws were already open to devour him. It was a most disgusting creature, hideous in
            form, mottled with black and yellow scales, and covered with
            a filthy looking slime. The king shuddered as he glanced at
            the monstrous reptile; and as usual he turned for aid to the
            fairy. His heart sank when he beheld her standing afar off,
            with folded arms and sorrowful downcast face.
         </p>
         
         <p>He felt that on himself depended his salvation from this
            new and formidable foe. The thought that his own weak
            wilfulness had deprived his hitherto protectress of the power
            to help him, inspired his heart and arm with fresh energy,
            and he resolved to redeem the position he had lost, or die in
            the attempt. Leaping from his horse, which had crouched
            to earth, convulsed with fear at sight of the serpent, 
            <span class="person">Abdallah</span> sprang behind the reptile, and before it was able to turn
            its head, cut with his sabre right through the middle of its
            body. The lower part expired instantly; the upper, spread
            forth two small wings from the side of its head, and raised
            itself, though with difficulty, some few feet above the
            earth. 
            <span class="person">Abdallah</span> remounted his horse, which had regained
            its courage, but even on horseback the serpent was beyond
            the reach of his sword, while it was able to assail him
            by spitting down its venom. He was hesitating what to
            do when suddenly the fairy stood before him. and put into
            his hand her silver wand, the point of which had grown
            sharp like a javelin. The king at once hurled it at the reptile with such good aim that its heart was pierced, and it
            fell dead on the sand.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>"Bravely done," exclaimed the fairy, "you have fully
            atoned for your disobedience--but let it not be repeated. You
            will never encounter a more terrible enemy than this. Thank
            Allah for your deliverance."
         </p>
         
         <p>When he had recovered breath, the king felt curious to
            know what had become of the damsel, but he dared not look
            around for her. The fairy, however, knew his thought, and
            said, "There she lies. She and the serpent are one."
         </p>
         
         <p>The king made no reply, for he yet felt full of shame, and
            dared not ask more questions of the fairy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Such were some of the perils that beset the king of 
            <span class="person">Tarudant</span> in his progress through the desert. Each day he encountered some ferocious wild beast, or formidable monster;
            but each day his strength and courage increased, until victory became so certain and easy, that he scarcely regarded
            dangers from which he would once have shrunk aghast. But
            these conflicts grew less and less frequent, and nearly a week
            had passed without a hostile meeting of any kind, when one
            fine morning 
            <span class="person">Abdallah</span> and his guide found themselves at
            the edge of the desert, in full view of the mountain whose
            summit was the termination of their pilgrimage.
         </p>
         
         <p>The king's heart beat high with hope and his eyes kindled
            with delight as he gazed upon the scene before him. He
            beheld a vast plain extending on either hand, till it mingled
            with the skies, while in front it sloped very gently upwards
            to a mountainous elevation, where it ended in a table land
            that stretched away to the right and left farther than his
            sight could reach. So gradual was the ascent, that the
            mountain-top was distant enough to appear blue and misty,
            though it was free from clouds and the sunlight streamed
            brightly upon it. Beyond the table-land, the loftiest peaks
            of Mount Atlas abruptly reared their hoary heads, venerable
            with the snows of a thousand ages, and seeming in their sublime scenery conscious of the awful solitude in which they
            dwelt, far above the din and conflict of the earth, the disturbing thunders, the shattering lightnings, the heaven-veiling
            clouds, abiding, like the celestial principle they represent, in
            a region pure and calm, where nor human feet nor human
            passions ever can penetrate. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Rivers of clear sparkling water rolled over the mountain s
            brow, and descended the plain, spreading life and beauty to
            the verge of the desert, amid whose sands they finally vanished, but not uselessly, for year by year their ceaseless influence reclaimed a portion of the sterile soil.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I congratulate you, king of Tarudant," said the fairy,
            "your troubles are nearly at an end. On yonder mountain's
            top is my sister's capital city: if your sight were as keen as
            mine, you could perceive the summit of its highest tower,
            the setting sun will see us at its gates. Let us proceed."
         </p>
         
         <p>They passed rapidly onward, for even Abdallah's horse
            was animated with new vigor by the cheerful scenes through
            which their course now lay. They were indeed moving
            amidst beauty and enjoyment far exceeding all that the king
            had ever seen. The country was covered with a rich and
            graceful and variegated vegetation, among which, at intervals, arose the embattled walls and stately towers of some
            fair city, whose white fabrics sparkled gloriously in the sunlight; while yet more frequently, tall airy minarets springing from the depth of shady groves, marked the sites of pretty
            villages, too modest wholly to show themselves.
         </p>
         
         <p>The land, indeed, swarmed with inhabitants living not
            only in cities and villages, but in isolated dwellings--in
            charming cottages, begirt with flowery gardens--in elegant
            mansions crowning gentle heights. And all this population
            was busy and joyous; no one was idle--no one looked sad
            or discontented. On every side the travellers beheld groups
            of men and women engaged in the various offices of cultivation, working steadfastly, but with evident pleasure, some
            merrily singing, some making the air ring with laughter, as
            they gave and received good-humored jests, or in unenvious
            rivalry outstripped their fellow laborers. Bands of bright
            and happy-looking children were rambling among the bushes
            gathering berries, or running gaily across the fields, bearing
            messages from group to group. The song of unmolested
            birds resounded from the trees, and the gentle voices of domestic animals, rejoicing in green pastures, were borne along
            on every breeze that blew.
         </p>
         
         <p>The king and the fairy journeyed amid these charming
            scenes along a path bordered by graceful trees whose boughs
            were bent with clusters of rich fruit, and occasionally they
            crossed on sculptured bridges sparkling and murmurous
            streams, in the clear depths of which were visible the glan
            cing movements of brightly colored fishes. Abdallah's delight continually increased, though he could not help sometimes mournfully contrasting the desolation of his own kingdom with the prosperity around him, and he urged on his
            horse to the top of its speed impatient to reach her presence
            from whose beneficent sway flowed so much beauty and happiness. Even the grave fairy at his side partook of his enthusiasm, and as if kindled by the thought of meeting her
            good sister, the cold, pale elegance of her features warmed
            into a softer and far more enjoying expression.
         </p>
         
         <p>At length they were upon the mountain's top, in full view
            of the fairy capital. Involuntarily, as the sight burst upon
            his eyes, 
            <span class="person">Abdallah</span> checked his horse, that he might contemplate its wondrous magnificence. It was square, of vast extent, and surrounded by a high wall of crystal so transparent
            that the people and buildings within were almost as distinctly seen as though nothing but air intervened. This wall was
            surmounted by battlements of silver on which were standing
            in long array, rank after rank of silent, stern-visaged warriors, covered with glistening steel and armed with spears and
            bucklers. Structures of superhuman splendor were ranged
            along broad streets, through which flowed to and fro the restless' surges of a mighty population, whose picturesque and
            varied garb accorded well with the light and fanciful architecture. The sun was declining in the west, and its beams
            invested the city with rainbow hues and rendered its brilliancy almost too dazzling for mortal eyes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Recovering from his trance of admiration, the king advanced to the chief gate of the city, each leaf of which was formed of one immense piece of jasper, while the gate-posts
            were covered with the most resplendent precious stones.
            With infinite astonishment he perceived as he drew nigh to
            the wall that the armed men upon the battlements had changed into smiling maidens dressed in while robes with scarlet
            sashes, and holding bunches of flowers instead of war-like
            weapons. As he approached these descended, and throwing
            open the jasper gates, received him with songs of welcome
            and strewed his way with flowers. He dismounted from his
            horse at the request of his companion the fairy, who told
            him that none but human feet were permitted to tread those
            holy streets, and entering the city proceeded amid the greeting shouts of the multitude to a noble square not far from
            the gate.
         </p>
         
         <p>Here he was met by a venerable emir who received him
            with great courtesy, saying that the fairy queen had deputed
            him to meet her distinguished guest and attend to all his
            wants. The king desired repose and refreshment after so
            long a journey, and was at once conducted to the nearest palace there to pass the night, while his fairy guide went on
            without delay, to the dwelling of her sister.

         <p>Grand Concert of the German Society.--Some twentyfive hundred persons visited the Tabernacle on Saturday
            evening. We regret that we are unable to record the exact proportion which the "upper ten thousand" bore to the
            mass, but if the exact amount of tickets given away can be
            ascertained, the result will show the number of the "upper
            ten" present upon this occasion. There were several serious
            people there.
         </p>
         
         <p>We observed quite a number of the subjects of Pico-dom.
            They may be distinguished by their very long hair, and their
            plaintive style of countenance, as though "grief had passed
            in that direction." They may also be distinguished by the
            steady enthusiasm with which they applaud to the echo the
            most trifling effort of their Queen of song.
         </p>
         
         <p>Whoever arranged the programme made a great mistake.
            The last piece should have been first, and the first, last.
            The idea of placing a symphony which takes three quarters
            of an hour to play, at the end of a long concert, is preposterous. This was clearly demonstrated at their preceding concert, when more than half the audience left during the first
            movement; and on the present occasion many hundreds left
            before and during the symphony. Such a scuffling of feet
            
            and slamming of doors, we have rarely heard in a concert
            room. To listen in comfort was impossible, and 
            <span class="person">Beethoven</span>
            suffered, and we suffered with him, for want of common
            sense in those who arranged the programme.

         <p>The overture of 
            <span class="person">Der Freischutz</span> was better performed than
            we ever heard it in this country, and we feel bound to compliment all concerned. The basses in particular were excellent, firm, distinct and marked. Mr. 
            <span class="person">Hill</span> conducted admirably, with one exception: during the agitato movement, he
            changed the beat so frequently, that a slight wavering was
            the result. Changing the beat backwards and forwards
            from four to two, and from two to four, can only produce
            one effect--uncertainty.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Rondo by Madame Pico was well sung. Her execution in many passages was beautifully distinct and rapid, as
            she gave both emphasis and feeling to the recitative. But
            poor 
            <span class="person">Rossini</span> was turned upside down, for with the exception
            of the two first bars of the 
            <span class="person">Rondo</span>, we scarcely heard a note
            of the original composition. Madame Pico pleased us by
            no means as well in 
            <span class="person">Casta Diva</span>. She, as usual, displayed
            many peculiar excellences, but she took such unaccountable
            liberties with the tempo, that the accompaniments were all
            abroad. It is true that the Philharmonic Orchestra has never been particularly famous for accompanying, and certainly
            its least creditable efforts are in Italian music. We reiterate,
            that, even allowing that the singer takes licences, still the
            accompaniments on almost every occasion, are utterly disgraceful both to the Director and to the members of the
            band, and the reputation of the Society cannot fail to suffer
            from such culpable and unartist-like negligence. 
            <span class="person">Signori
               Milon
            </span> and Lo. 
            <span class="person">Bianco</span> did some little towards keeping the recitatives straight.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Scharfenberg's pianoforte piece, was a beautiful performance. This master, to great brilliancy of execution,
            firmness of touch, strength and flexibility of wrist, adds the
            charm of perfect distinctness and marked emphasis. Of all
            the movements the Adagio was the least successful in performance. Here was an absence of passion and expression,
            without which an adagio is pointless. Charming as was
            the performance of Mr. 
            <span class="person">Scharfenberg</span>, we have heard him do
            more justice to himself. In more profitable concerns, we
            trust that he will not forget that the public expect much gratification from his solo playing.
         </p>
         
         <p>The German Chorusses were not as well executed as on
            the previous occasion, nor was the selection as pleasing.
            The pieces were long and heavy in the extreme, and though
            grateful to a musician's ear from their fine harmony, prove
            ineffectual and tiresome to the general taste.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The leader of the Chorusses, Mr. 
            <span class="person">Perabeau</span>, would have
            made a much better impression if he had conducted himself
            in a more quiet manner. It would have been quite as easy,
            and much more respectful to the audience, to have removed
            the books from the chair to the piano stool, instead of casting
            them upon the ground and slamming the chair down to the
            instrument. The first chorus, Festlied, would have been
            more appropriately called a pianoforte Solo, accompanied by
            voices, so entirely overpowering was the noise of the instrument. In choral quartettes the instrument should always be
            secondary, in most of them entirely tacit. Here was another
            point which was as injudicious as it was annoying; at certain parts he would give isolated notes to the voices, with
            the full weight of his arm, producing a most unpleasant effect, and conveying rather the ideas of a practice than a performance.
         </p>
         
         <p>Two members of the Brooklyn Glee Club, not members
            of the Manner Chor, distinguished themselves in the extreme
            parts (first tenor and second bass) by the beauty of their voi
            ces and the correctness of their taste and execution.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Grœneveldt's Solo on the Clarionet, was, as usual, a
            masterly and exquisite performance. In every point, tone,
            taste, style, expression and execution, he left us little to wish
            for. He was accompanied a trifle better than at the Philharmonic Concert, but still the accompaniments were slovenly
            and unartist-like.
         </p>
         
         <p>The performance of Mendelssohn's Fingal's Cave, was a
            failure in comparison with its first appearance at the Society's concert. The tempo was too fast; many passages were
            in consequence rendered obscure, and the poetical beauties
            which characterize the composition, could not be developed
            in the unseemly haste which hurried them onward.
         </p>
         
         <p>The grand sinfonia in C minor, was, however, a redeeming performance. It was played throughout, with one or
            two exceptions in the finale, most admirably. The andante
            was a masterly performance, and excited universal admiration.
         </p>
         
         <p>The materials of the concert were chosen with taste and
            judgment, and on the whole it was probably the best benefit concert ever given in the city.

            <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span>'s Method for the Piano-Forte. Published by Oakes, and sold by E.
            H. Wade, 197 Washington St., Boston.
         </p>
         
         <p>We gave a preliminary notice of this great work in our last number,
            since when we have looked through it attentively, for the purpose of
            judging of its value impartially, to the end that we might benefit the
            public, by displaying its merits or by exposing its faults. We say that
            we have looked into the work, and it gives us much pleasure in being
            able to say, that the more we examined it, the more delighted we
            were with the beautiful simplicity of its construction, its lucid explanation, its natural and progressive arrangement. Its system is purely inductive. Not as in the old instruction books, are unexplained
            symbols placed before the pupil to commence with at once; nothing
            is introduced, which does not follow in a natural and undeviating
            course. To teach by the old books, pre-supposes some weeks of previous study of the theory, without the assistance of manual practice.
            This is so much lime wasted, for the natural embarrassment, consequent upon placing the fingers for the first time upon the keys, will
            drive all previous non-practical study from the learner's mind, and
            will tend rather to retard, than to accelerate his progress. It is in
            fact twice learning the same thing. It is true that there are exercises
            of various kinds, which might be used with these exploded and very
            imperfect methods, and which most good masters availed themselves
            of, but these are unaccompanied by marginal directions, and from the
            dry uninteresting surface presented to the student's eye, are mostly
            looked upon with indifference, if not with disgust.
         </p>
         
         <p>Our opinion upon these matters is the result of an experience of many years, during
            which time all kinds o| methods have come under
            
            our notice. We have felt how utterly inadequate these were to fulfil
            the end for which they were intended, namely, to assist the master in
            explaining to the pupil, and to assist the pupil when absent from the
            master. Much that is necessary between master and pupil, can never
            be written down; it must be communicated orally, but we conscientiously believe that 
            <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span> has produced a progressive work as near perfection as possible.
         </p>
         
         <p>It will be impossible, within the limits of our space, to enter into a
            full consideration of every portion of this important work, but we
            shall, from time to lime, call the attention of our young readers to particular parts of it deserving their especial attention.
         </p>
         
         <p>The work commences with a very clear and striking exposition of
            the key-board, or entire scale of the instrument. It is so clearly explained that the dullest mind can comprehend it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The hands of the pupil are then placed upon the key-board, and the
            fingers are accustomed by slow degrees, to move equally in the natural position. Meanwhile, upon each page, the marginal directions are
            gradually preparing the mind of the pupil to receive understandingly
            the rudiments of the theory. The entire exercises upon time, are
            truly invaluable; they are clear, decided, embracing almost every variety, and being enforced both by theory and practice, cannot fail, if
            carefully digested, to make the pupil, in a short period, perfectly familiar with the subject.
         </p>
         
         <p>The scales are here made a very important feature. They are
            treated in every position, and the fingering being carefully marked,
            their difficulties are rendered comparatively easy, and the results from
            a constant practice of them would be, certainty and firmness of touch
            and fingering, and a wonderful facility in reading at sight.
         </p>
         
         <p>The studies are numerous, and form a very important portion of the
            Work. They are in every key, and embrace nearly all the peculiarities and difficulties, that are to be met with in solos of moderate importance.
         </p>
         
         <p>We cordially recommend this work to all teachers, as the most
            comprehensive method now published, and as the best assistant to
            their instruction, affording as it does, a certain means of strengthening
            the memory of the student between lesson and lesson.
         </p>
         
         <p>To parents, and to others who wish to commence the study of music, we earnestly recommend a perusal of this work, as we are sure
            that a mere glance at its contents, the simplicity of its arrangement
            being so evident, will convince them of its value, and of its superiority
            over every other method.
         </p>
         
         <p>We hope yet to see it in general use, so satisfied are we of the benefits it will confer, and surely if any thing will tend to confirm the
            public
            confidence in it, some of the eminent men whose names axe attached
            to the circular, who vouch for its excellence, will exert that happy in
            fluence.
         </p>
         
         <p>The public and the Profession owe a debt of gratitude to the enterprising publisher Mr. 
            <span class="person">Oakes</span>, for bringing forward this valuable and
            expensive work, and we earnestly hope that he will reap the reward
            of his public spirit.

            scattered members of the late party, and to establish at least a season
            of twelve nights, with Pico for the great attraction. We sincerely
            believe that it would be a signal failure, for, with all Borghese's faults,
            and she had many, as we had occasion to shew, she was still a great
            favorite with the largest class of the opera patrons.

            gains will be secured to him, he purposes to import an entirely new
            company from Italy, by the Fall. De Begnis should be supported by
            all who wish to see the Italian Opera established in the city, for he
            possesses two things qualifying him for manager, which no other individual does--great firmness and long experience.

         <p>Mitchell's Olympic Theatre.--This delightful place of
            amusement continues its career of perfect success. It is, without
            a doubt, the most respectable as well as the best managed Theatre in
            the city. The company is excellent for all its purposes, its pieces are
            well chosen, and every arrangement is calculated to insure the visitor
            an evening of complete enjoyment. Miss 
            <span class="person">Taylor</span> and Miss 
            <span class="person">Clark</span>, continue the prime favorites of the public, and well do these talented and
            persevering young ladies deserve their success. 
            <span class="person">Mitchell</span> and Holland
            preside over the department of fun, and sorrow must indeed be heavy
            on the heart, if it will not vanish for a couple of hours before their
            merry magic. The two new pieces produced here on Tuesday evening
            were highly successful. The one a farce, entitled Medical Science,
            from the pen of Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="tpicton">Thomas Picton Milner</span>, is a sprightly and witty production. We regret that our want of space prevents us noticing it at
            length this week. This young gentleman is, we believe, the grandson
            of the celebrated Sir 
            <span class="person" id="stpicton">Thomas Picton</span>. The other piece is a burlesque
            upon the popular opera of the Bohemian Girl. We shall particularise
            in our next.

            <p>Inaugural Address, delivered before the Mechanics' Institute of the State of
               New York, by 
               <span class="person" id="jjmapes">James J. Mapes</span>, President. 1845.
            </p>
            
            <p>Unlike the greater part of the addresses which we have heard and
               read, this impresses us less with the importance of the speaker than
               of his subject. Indeed, we have rarely read an essay in which the
               writer has contrived so completely to overshadow himself in the
               greatness of his theme. Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jjmapes">Mapes</span> is too much of an enthusiast in
               the cause of science to waste his own, or his hearer's time, with any
               superfluous flourishes of rhetoric, or by introducing in a practicnl
               discourse any extrinsic subject. He is plain, direct, and impressive.
               His great aim is to impress upon the minds of his hearers the importance of cultivating the intellect by storing it with facts. He makes
               a forcible appeal in behalf of the arts of design, which we trust will
               not be without an influence upon those who heard it. The importance
               of an artistic education to our mechanics, is but imperfectly understood. Without an ability to design, the most stringent tariff would
               do little towards aiding our manufactures. The address contains an
               idea, not altogether new, but new in its application, respecting the
               use of Caryatides in architecture. We should be glad to see it adopted
               by way of an experiment; to substitute the form of some living thing
               
               in the place of the eternal columns which disfigure so many of our
               public buildings. Anything would be a relief to the wearisome effect
               of the five orders, even though it were disorder itself.
            </p>
            
            <p>We congratulate the Mechanics' Institute on having for a President
               a gentleman who unites to extensive information an original genius,
               and a disinterested zeal in the propagation of knowledge. We have
               hardly a right to expect wit in a discourse like this, but we see little
               scintillations of it bursting forth here and there, as if by stealth, and
               without the consciousness of the lecturer.
            </p>
            
            <p>With a president like Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jjmapes">Mapes</span>, and so intelligent an officer as
               Mr. Barritt, the actuary, the Mechanics' Institute must exert in the

               readily as laugh at some of his most humorous sketches.

            <p>The Democratic Review for March.</p>
            
            <p>This is altogether a very excellent number; it is, in fact, the best
               that we have seen of this magazine. The first nrticle, on Tyler, which
               wp hope is from the pen of the editor, beause it will induce us to read
               his political speculations hereafter, if it be, is the best paper in it;
               and may be read with pleasure by any one, without regard to political prejudices, merely for the easy strength of the style and the confident impudence (we know of no other word that will exactly express
               our meaning) of its tone. The paper on Fiction by Major 
               <span class="person" id="adavezac">Davezac</span>
               we are very happy to commend, because we have seen some of the
               Major's Essays that we could not approve with a clear conscience.
               The account of the four Presidents of Texas is highly interesting, and
               the other papers are both readable and profitable.

            <p>Military Maxims of Napoleon. Translated from the French by 
               <span class="person" id="jakerly">J. Akerly</span>.
               New York: Wiley &amp; Putnam. 1846.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Akerly's name is new to us, but we think that it cannot be new
               in literature, for he writes with the elegance and precision of a practised author. His translation reads like an original composition, and
               we should never dream of its being rendered from another language
               than that in which it is written. As a specimen of elegant book-making, we have rarely seen this little volume surpassed by any issue
               from the American press. The maxims themselves are not subjects
               for criticism, but we should be glad to know the author's motives in
               publishing them. He has dedicated his volume to the officers of the
               regular army of the United States, who, we trust, will never have occasion to use it as a text book.
            </p>
            
            <p>We cannot allow this opportunity to escape us of rebuking the aristocratic and exclusive spirit, more peculiar to our own country than
               any other in the world, which is manifested in the dedication of this
               book, of making a distinction between the officers and the rank and
               file of the army. In England, and France, and Russia, we always
               hear the Army or the Navy spoken of as a body--here, it is always
               the officers of our Army or of our Navy. At public dinners, in Congressional speeches, in newspaper paragraphs, the universal phraseology is, " the gallant officers of our army," &amp;c. If we should
               ever
               again be involved in war, all this nonsense will, of necessity, be abolished; for it is idle to expect that the citizens of the republic
               will
               serve in either department of the public defence, to be treated as mere
               automata, and be excluded from all the honors and emoluments
               which their valor might win. God grant that the experiment may
               never be tried; but it requires no spirit of prophecy to foresee, that
               under the present system of conferring offices, disgrace and defeat
               would be the result of every engagement with an enemy.

            <p>The March number of this valuable periodical contains a paper on the consular system
               of the United States, which should be carefully
               read by every man who can exert the smallest degree of influence in
               the National councils. There are some abuses existing in the economy
               of our government, which all admit and none pretend to justify, but
               which, nevertheless, no one attempts to remove. The Consular system
               is the chief of them. The Consulship of Liverpool is said to be worth
               $20,000 per annum, while that of Cadiz, of Leghorn, of Genoa, and of
               many other important ports is not worth enough to pay the expenses
               of the Consul's office. Yet the responsibilities are as great in one
               port as another. It is the more remarkable that no attempts should
               have been made to equalize the incomes of these ports, since they
               might be made so large an addition to the patronage of the executive;
               there are not more than half a dozen consulships at present worth the
               acceptance of an ambitious man. But these offices might be increased
               to a very great extent, and the country would be a gainer, as well as
               political adventurers. Since Mr. 
               <span class="person">Polk</span> will be freed from the troublesome business of securing his re-election, we trust that he will look
               about him to see what abuses of the government he can rectify, and
               we have no doubt of his attention being called to the subject of the
               Consular agents to begin with.

               knows well what he is thinking about--a very great deal to say of any

         <p>Messrs. Wiley and Putnam have announced a series of Minor Classics, something in the way of Dove's Classics, etc.; the aim, however,
            as regards externals, being to reconcile the utmost possible cheapness,
            with a proper attention to the mechanical execution. The series will
            be entitled, "Wiley and Putnam's Library of Choice Reading," and
            will be issued rapidly, at convenient intervals, in a novel and agreeable book form. Each volume will include the matter of an ordinary
            English octavo, and will be sold at three shillings. The works published will be new or old, drawn either from the best contemporary
            writers, or from the antique "well of English undefiled." A very important, and to our minds the most interesting branch of the undertaking, will be an American Copyright Series. The "Library" will open,
            in a few days, with Eothen; Mary Schweidler, the Amber Witch; and
            Undine with Sintrim and His Companions. Perhaps the first of the
            American Series will be 
            <span class="person" id="jtheadley">Headley</span>'s "Letters from Italy," of which
            only a fourth part has been as yet published. We may expect this
            in April. The motto of the "Library" is from Lamb--"Books which
            are books." The editorial conduct of the whole is entrusted to a gentleman whose fine taste and great ability are matters not to be questioned.

            the laws required two-thirds of every ships' crew to be Americans,
            not an American ship has left an American port within the last twenty-five years, with Americans for one half its crew. And we are told
            that Britain has more seamen than employment tor them in time of
            peace, in its military or mercantile marine; that France can raise
            more seamen in a day, than the United Slates in a month; that the
            Swedish seamen in American service make an average of one for every
            vessel; and that the United States, with twenty millions of people,
            and a commerce only second in the world, and rapidly becoming the
            first, have not more than ten thousand native seamen. Daily paper.

         <p>A writer in the Tribune, "J.S. of Maine," contends that the Report
            of Mr. Reade, Chairman of the Committee on Naval affairs in Congress, stating, that out of 109,000 seamen sailing in American ships,
            only 9000 were Americans, must be incorrect, inasmuch as the state of
            Maine furnishes 11,000 sailors, the principal part of whom are captains and mates, and he sets down the proportion of foreigners, one
            to four instead of one to twelve. His calculations may be correct for
            the state of Maine, but we have no question of the truth of the statement in Mr. Reade's report. It is a very common thing for some of
            our New York ships to leave port without an American on board, excepting the officers. The subject is one of vast importance to in
            country, particularly when there is a speck of war in the horizon; but
            instead of compelling our merchant vessels to take a certain number
            of boys, as has often been proposed, it will be better to open the line
            of promotion in our navy, to make it an inducement for American
            youth to enter the service. This would immediately fill our national
            vessels with American young men, and as but a small part of them
            could become officers, the remainder would form an efficient corps
            hardy, intelligent sailors, who would have the honor of their country
            at heart, and an esprit de corps would be infused into the service, such
            as has never pervaded it, and would render our marine and invincible
            body.

            <p>THE BEETHOVEN COLLECTION of Sacred Music
                is warmly recommended as the very best Music Book extant. This great

            </p>
            
            <p>This Collection is entirely new, containing the largest number ever published in one volume, of tine and solid Church Tunes, beautifully harmonized. There is a separate Organ-part, together with Anthems, Te Drums,
               Chants, Ac., arranged expressly for this work.

            <p>Letters from the moat distinguished artists in all parts of the country,
               speaking in unqualified terms of approbation, have been received. The more
               the collection is known, the better it is appreciated. It has already superseded
               the old collection in the principal churches of N ew York, and it is always introduced into choirs when its great merits are understood.
            </p>
            
            <p>The work comprises one hundred and ninety-two pages of music, with the
               words of the various hymns, which are of the highest character, and never

            </div>
            
            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
               work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
               the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and
               studies, are
               given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
               carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
               otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
               has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
               and it is only by the study of such methods as 
               <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span>'s that pupils will be en
               abled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rudments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
               lesson
               is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from professional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertiwi'i
               Method

            <p>TAKEN by Mons. EDOUART in an unique style peculiarly hisown, which has been patronized by the Crowned heads of Europe and tne most distinguished families of America. Mons. E. begs to observe that his likenesses are true to nature, and that the manner he
               disposes
               of the figures constituting his Family Group has always elicited the highest
               commendation from eminent artists of both hemispheres. The large number of groups in his possesion (which are for sale,) evince his

            <p>A collection of 160,000 likenesses with autographs appended, preserved in
               books and large groupings of distinguished characters, are testimonials of his
               unrivalled skill. Those who wish to leave mementos to posterity should not
               lose the present opportunity. A call at his exhibition room (fret) will satisfy
               all that these works are entirely unique and capable of residing the destructive influences of time.--His Fireside Groups, representing the members
               of
               families united, which union must be of short duration, separations occuring by marriage, change of location and demise, can be faithfully

            <p>Goldsmith's Gems of Pennmanship.--The Chirographic art is
               much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, and
               Mr. 
               <span class="person">Goldsmith</span> may well claim to be considered at its head. The
               volume before us exhibits more taste and ingenuity, and higher proofs
               of manual dexterity than we have ever seen before.

               executed by his own hand, and a more beautiful, and indeed a more
               wonderful display of the power of that little instrument which is said
               to be "more potent than the sword," we never witnessed before.
