          <p>In the internal decoration, if not in the external architec-
<br/>ture of their residences, the English are supreme. The Ital-
<br/>ians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colors.
<br/>In France meliora probant, deteriora sequuntur—the people
<br/>are too much a race of gad-abouts to maintain those house-
<br/>hold proprieties of which, indeed, they have a delicate ap-
<br/>preciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The
<br/>Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but in-
<br/>appropriate fancy. The Scotch are poor decorists. The
<br/>Dutch have, perhaps, an indeterminate idea that a curtain is
<br/>not a cabbage. In Spain they are all curtains a nation of
<br/>hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The Hottentots
<br/>and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees
<br/>alone are preposterous.</p>
            <p>How this happens it is not difficult to see. We have no
<br/>aristocracy of blood, and having therefore as a natural, and
<br/>indeed as an inevitable thing, fashioned for ourselves an aris-
<br/>tocracy of dollars, the display of wealth has here to take
<br/>the place and perform the office of the heraldic display in
<br/>monarchical countries. By a transition readily understood,
<br/>and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have
<br/>been brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste it-
<br/>self.</p>
            <p>To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no
<br/>mere parade of costly appurtenances would be so likely as
<br/>with us, to create an impression of the beautiful in respect
<br/>to the appurtenances themselves—or of taste as regards the
<br/>proprietor :—this for the reason, first, that wealth is not, in
<br/>England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a no-
<br/>bility; and secondly, that there the true nobility of blood,
<br/>confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste,
<br/>rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a
<br/>parvenu rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.
<br/>The people will imitate the nobles, and the result is a tho-
<br/>rough diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America the
<br/>coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy, their
<br/>display may be said, in general, to be the sole means of aris-
<br/>tocratic distinction; and the populace, looking always up-
<br/>ward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two en-
<br/>tirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short,
<br/>the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be,
<br/>with us, nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative
<br/>Point of view—and this test, once established, has led the
<br/>way to many analogous errors, readily traceable to the one
<br/>primitive folly.</p>
            <p>There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye
<br/>of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the United
<br/>States—that is to say in Appallachia—a well furnished
<br/>apartment. Its most usual defect is a want of keeping. We
<br/>speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping
<br/>of a picture—for both the picture and the room are amena-
<br/>ble to those undeviating principles which regulate a varie-
<br/>ties of art, and very nearly the same laws by which we de-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>cide on the higher merits of a painting, suffice for decision
<br/>on the adjustment of a chamber.</p>
            <p>A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the charac-
<br/>ter of the several pieces of furniture, but generally in their
<br/>colors or modes of adaptation to use. Very often the eye
<br/>is offended by their inartistical arrangement. Straight lines
<br/>are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly continued—or clum-
<br/>sily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines occur, they
<br/>are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision
<br/>the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.</p>
            <p>Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen, in re-
<br/>spect to other decorations. With formal furniture curtains
<br/>are out of place; and an extensive volume of drapery of any
<br/>kind is, under any circumstances, irreconcilable with good
<br/>taste: the proper quantum, as well as the proper adjust-
<br/>ment, depending upon the character of the general effect.</p>
            <p>Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days,
<br/>but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colors.
<br/>The soul of the apartment is the carpet. From it are de-
<br/>duced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incum-
<br/>bent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary man ; a
<br/>good judge of a carpet must be a genius. Yet we have heard
<br/>discoursing of carpets, with the air “ d'un mouton qui réve,”
<br/>fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with
<br/>the management of their own moustaches. Every one knows
<br/>that a large floor may have a covering of large figures, and
<br/>that a small one must have a covering of small—yet this is
<br/>not all the knowledge in the world. As regards texture the
<br/>Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preter-pluper-
<br/>fect tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying ago-
<br/>nies. Touching pattern—a carpet should not be bedizzened
<br/>out like a Riccaree Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and
<br/>cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct grounds, and vivid circu-
<br/>lar or cycloid figures, of no meaning, are here Median laws.
<br/>The abomination of flowers, or representations of well-known
<br/>objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits
<br/>of Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains,
<br/>or tapestry, or ottoman-coverings, all upholstery of this na-
<br/>ture should be rigidly Arabesque. As for those antique floor-
<br/>cloths still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble
<br/>—cloths of huge, sprawling, and radiating devices, stripe-
<br/>interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among which no
<br/>ground is intelligible,—these are but the wicked invention
<br/>of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal
<br/>and worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who to spare
<br/>thought, and economize fancy, first cruelly invented the Kal-
<br/>eidoscope, and then established joint-stock companies to twirl
<br/>it by steam.</p>
            <p>Glare is a leading error in the philosophy of American
<br/>household decoration—an error easily recognized as deduced
<br/>from the perversion of taste just specified. We are violent-
<br/>ly enamoured of gas and of glass. The former is totally in-
<br/>admissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady light of-
<br/>fends No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A
<br/>mild, or what artists term a cool light, with its consequent<div class="pagebreak" id="#page274"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>warm shadows, will do wonders for even an ill-furnished
<br/>apartment. Never was a more lovely thought than that of
<br/>the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp pro-
<br/>per— the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground
<br/>glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays.
<br/>The cut glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The
<br/>eagerness with which we have adopted it, partly on account
<br/>of its flashiness, but principally on account of its greater cost,
<br/>is a good commentary on the proposition with which we be-
<br/>gan. It is not too much to say that the deliberate employ-
<br/>er of a cut glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste,
<br/>or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light
<br/>proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal,
<br/>broken, and painful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of
<br/>good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence. Fe-
<br/>male loveliness, in especial, is more than one half disenchant-
<br/>ed beneath its evil eye.</p>
            <p>In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false
<br/>principles. Its leading feature is glitter—and in that one
<br/>word how much of all that is detestable do we express!
<br/>Flickering, unquiet lights are sometimes pleasing—to child-
<br/>ren and idiots always so—but in the embellishment of a
<br/>room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth, even
<br/>strong steady lights are inadmissible. The huge and un-
<br/>meaning glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and with-
<br/>out shade, which dangle in our most fashionable drawing-
<br/>rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false
<br/>in taste or preposterous in folly.</p>
            <p>The rage for glitter—because its idea has become, as we
<br/>before observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the
<br/>abstract—has led us, also, to the exaggerated employment
<br/>of mirrors. We line our dwellings with great British plates,
<br/>and then imagine we have done a fine thing. Now the
<br/>slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who
<br/>has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glass-
<br/>es, and especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its
<br/>reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colorless,
<br/>unrelieved surface—a thing always and obviously unpleasant.
<br/>Considered as a reflector, it is potent in producing a mon-
<br/>strous and odious uniformity:—and the evil is here aggravat-
<br/>ed, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of
<br/>its sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a
<br/>room with four or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all
<br/>purposes of artistic show, a room of no shape at all. If we
<br/>add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon glitter, we have a
<br/>perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects. The
<br/>veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,
<br/>would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he
<br/>might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatis-
<br/>faction. But let the same person be led into a room taste-
<br/>fully furnished, and he would be startled into an exclamation
<br/>of pleasure and surprise.</p>
            <p>It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions,
<br/>that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul
<br/>which he keeps in it. The corruption of taste is a portion
<br/>or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture. As we grow rich
<br/>our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among our aristo-
<br/>cracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia) for the spi-
<br/>rituality of a British boudoir. But we have seen apartments
<br/>in the tenure of Americans of modern means—which, in ne-
<br/>gative merit at least, might vie with any of the or-molu'd
<br/>cabinets of our friends across the water. Even now, there is
<br/>present to our mind's eye a small and not ostentatious cham-
<br/>ber with whose decorations no fault can be found. The pro-
<br/>prietor lies asleep on a sofa—the weather is cool—the time
<br/>is near midnight—we will make a sketch of the room during
<br/>his slumber.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <p>It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in
<br/>breadth—a shape affording the best (ordinary) opportunities
<br/>for the adjustment of furniture. It has but one door—by no
<br/>means a wide one—which is at one end of the parallelogram,
<br/>and but two windows, which are at the other. These latter
<br/>are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep recesses,
<br/>and open on an Italian veranda. Their panes are of a crim-
<br/>son-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive
<br/>than usual. They are curtained within the recess, by a thick
<br/>silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window, and hang-
<br/>ing loosely in small volumes. Without the recess are cur-
<br/>tains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a deep
<br/>network of gold, and lined with the silver tissue, which is
<br/>the material of the exterior blind. There are no cornices;
<br/>but the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather
<br/>than massive, and have an airy appearance) issue from be-
<br/>neath a broad entablature of rich gilt work, which encircles
<br/>the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The dra-
<br/>pery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope
<br/>of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into
<br/>a knot;—no pins or other such devices are apparent. The
<br/>colors of the curtains and their fringe—the tints of crimson
<br/>and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and determine
<br/>the character of the room. The carpet, of Saxony material,
<br/>is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson ground,
<br/>relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that
<br/>festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of
<br/>the ground, and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form
<br/>a succession of short irregular curves—one occasionally over-
<br/>laying the other. The walls are papered with a glossy paper
<br/>of a silver grey tint, spotted with small Arabesque devices
<br/>of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many paintings
<br/>relieve the expanse of the paper. These are chiefly land-
<br/>scapes of an imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of
<br/>Stanfield, or the lake of the Dismal Swamp, of Chapman.
<br/>There are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an
<br/>ethereal beauty—portraits in the manner of Sully. The tone
<br/>of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “ brilliant
<br/>effects.” Repose speaks in all. Not one is of small size.
<br/>Diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room, which
<br/>is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched.
<br/>The frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved, with-
<br/>out being dulled or fillagreed. They have the whole lustre
<br/>of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls, and do not
<br/>hang of! with cords. The designs themselves are often seen
<br/>to better advantage in this latter position, but the general
<br/>appearance of the chamber is injured. But one mirror, and
<br/>this not a very large one, is visible. In shape it is nearly
<br/>circular—and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can
<br/>be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of
<br/>the room. Two large low sofas of rose-wood and crimson
<br/>silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats with the exception
<br/>of two light conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There
<br/>is a piano-forte (rose-wood also,) without cover, and thrown
<br/>open. An octagonal table, formed altogether of the richest
<br/>gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. This
<br/>is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has been
<br/>thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases,
<br/>in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, oc-
<br/>cupy the slightly rounded angles of the room. A tall cande-
<br/>labrum, bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed
<br/>oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some
<br/>light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and
<br/>crimson silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three
<br/>hundred magnificently bound books. Beyond these things,
<br/>there is no furniture, if we except an Argand lamp, with a<div class="pagebreak" id="#page275"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>plain crimson-tinted ground-glass shade, which depends from
<br/>the lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and
<br/>throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all.</p>

            <p>No. 5. View of the Roman Forum.—Chev. Pacetti. A
<br/>little dingy canvass, with columns and arches, and other ar-
<br/>chitectural shapes, feebly represented on its surface. On
<br/>turning to the list of exhibitors, we learn that the Chev. Pa-
<br/>cetti resides in Rome, which is all the information that we
<br/>have been able to glean in respect to either the Chev. or his
<br/>soiled canvass : but we have a great curiosity to learn three
<br/>things: first, why the Chev. Pacetti’s Roman Forum was
<br/>brought away from Rome; second, why the same was hung
<br/>up in the exhibition of the National Academy, and third,
<br/>what the meaning of Chev. is as applied to a spoiler of can-
<br/>vass on a small scale. If any thing can cure our artists of
<br/>their absurd practice of making pilgrimages to Rome, it must
<br/>be the contemplation of such things as this of the Chev. Pa-
<br/>cetti’s, and the filthy daub by Rossiter that hangs near it,
<br/>which were both painted in the atmosphere of the eternal
<br/>city. Or if these things should not thoroughly wean an honest
<br/>mind from all yearnings after Italy, surely the comparison
<br/>of the works produced by the young artists who have never
<br/>left their native soil, with those by Huntington and Free-
<br/>man in the present exhibition which have been sent home
<br/>from Rome, must have the effect to do so. We do not find
<br/>the name of the Chev. Pacetti among the honorary members
<br/>of the Academy, but it will of course be put there before
<br/>long.</p>

            <div class="head">Landscape—by J. F. Cropsey, A.</div>  
           <p> No 16. Landscape—by J. F. Cropsey, A. Here is a very
<br/>genuine American picture, pervaded wtth great purity of
<br/>feeling and technical knowledge. The artist has been tied
<br/>down to the exact features of a particular scene, which he
<br/>has transferred to his canvass very successfully. The scene
<br/>is a view of the Saugerties White Lead Works on Esopus
<br/>Creek in this State. The time is early spring, when the ten-
<br/>der foliage of the trees gives to nature her sweetest aspect.
<br/>But it is also the most difficult aspect for the painter to re-
<br/>present, for every thiDg is tremulous with new life, and the
<br/>earth is covered with smiles like the face of an infant.
<br/>There are in this picture all the elements of a grand land-
<br/>scape, ledges of rocks, a fall of water, beautiful trees, and a
<br/>clear sky ; but yet a grand landscape has not been formed
<br/>by their combination, mainly because the artist has aimed to
<br/>give all the details of a particular locality rather than a
<br/>point of interest, imbued with a touch of truth and feeling.
<br/>The rocks are painted with sufficient knowledge for a geolo-
<br/>gist to give them a name, and the trees have a character of
<br/>their own in form and color, but their beauty is spoiled by
<br/>too much distinctness in the foliage. The shadows are clear
<br/>and cool, and the sky is of a quality that we can look into
<br/>rather than upon; but the water resembles some substance
<br/>that we have never seen—liquified sandstone, or something
<br/>like it. The foam upon it is whiling, not the graceful sub-
<br/>stance out of which the goddess of love and beauty bounded
<br/>into life and action. Of all natural things which the artist
<br/>strives to pul upon his canvass, water is the most perplexing
<br/>and intractable; it rarely finds its level in the imagination of
<br/>the painter, but seems to run from him, and he is generally
<br/>too indolent to run alter it. There is water enough in the
<br/>present exhibition, if it possessed the quality of a liquid, to
<br/>drown the world, yet Sisyphus might walk through the rooms
<br/>of the Academy without being reminded of his thirst, unless <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>he caught sight of the water-bucket and tin cup in Mr. Ed-
<br/>monds’ picture of the Truant School Boy. These are sug-
<br/>gestive of water, but the sea scene by Mr. Cole, the rivers of
<br/>Mr. Durand, the lake by Mr. Inman, and the Niagara Falls
<br/>by Mr. Havell, to leave the stagnant pool by Mr. Shegogue
<br/>out of the catalogue, do not, all combined, contain as much
<br/>moisture as Dives prayed for—one drop. Mr. Havell is ob-
<br/>trusively ambitious of painting water, for he has made an
<br/>attempt upon Niagara Falls and the North river, and yet he
<br/> has not given evidence of ability to depict a drop of dew. Of
<br/>all other painters in the world a New-Yorker is the least
<br/>excusable for libelling water; with a noble river on each side
<br/>of the city, a bay of unsurpassed magnificence before him,
<br/>and fountains dashing their spray in his face as he walks
<br/>through the street, he must become acquainted with the
<br/>qualities and appearances of the liquid element. Yet, with
<br/>all these advantages, we see our artists continually painting
<br/>lakes of polished steel, and oceans of sheep’s wool. The
<br/>reason is that they paint pictures in confined rooms, and bor-
<br/>row their waves and water-falls from engravings. But unless
<br/>an artist is willing to look nature in the face, and strive ho-
<br/>nestly to copy her features, he has no right to make an at-
<br/>tempt at representing her, for he will be certain to caricature
<br/>her. If a young painter be ambitious of fame, and should
<br/>think to gain it by making pictures of water, let him, instead
<br/>of making a pilgrimage to Rome, take up his residence on
<br/>Staten Island, and cross the bay every day in the year, rain
<br/>or shine, calm or storm, hot or cold. Let him take his seat
<br/>upon the taffrail of the boat, and never think about a shelter
<br/>or an umbrella, or coughs or colds, or rheumatic pains, but
<br/>watch the ever-varying form and color of the water, until
<br/>his frame shall become invigorated with health, his nerves
<br/>braced by the pure air, and his soul thoroughly imbued and
<br/>saturated with living palpable ideas of the glorious beauty
<br/>of the sea: its motion, moisture, transparency, and ever
<br/>changing but ever beautiful forms. Let him each day note
<br/>down his thoughts, and if at the end of the year he can re-
<br/>present upon his canvass one wave with the light palpitating
<br/>through its translucent form, or flashing in its dancing spray,
<br/>he will have laid the corner stone of an immortality and a
<br/>life of honor. But even though he should not be able to do
<br/>this to the degree that will satisfy his own aspirations, he
<br/>will have spent a year of delight that will freshen his after-
<br/>life, and have gained an amount of knowledge, that will, at
<br/>least, impart to his productions a degree of grace and beauty
<br/>which, otherwise, they could never have possessed. The bay
<br/>of New York is the happiest spot in the whole world to form
<br/>a painter, because it has all the qualities that water can pos-
<br/>sess; it has the rapid current of a river, the breadth, depth,
<br/>and motion of the sea, and the placidity and quiet of a lake.
<br/>Its surface, too, is covered at all times, with all the different
<br/>forms of boats that float—the canal boats from the interior,
<br/>the pleasure yacht, the skiff, river craft, galliots, war vessels,
<br/>steamers and merchant ships. There is not another port in
<br/>the United States where the same variety of navigation may
<br/>be found. But beyond all these advantages for the painter
<br/>are the shores which bind this matchless bay ; the wooded
<br/>hills, the palisades, the low beach, the ledges of rocks, the
<br/>fairy islands, with their demon-like fortifications, the city
<br/>rising from the sea, the promontories, light-houses, castle-
<br/>crowned heights and rocky precipices. Yet our artists give
<br/>us none of these glories on their canvasses. Mr. Cole has
<br/>gone down to Frenchman's bay, four or five hundred miles
<br/>off towards the North Pole, and has come back and painted
<br/>a pea-green sea with ledges of red rocks; Huntington has
<br/>gone to Tuscany, and sent home a landscape with prismatic
<br/>hills and a rivulet of soap-suds; Inman went to Cumberland,<div class="pagebreak" id="#page276"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>and sent here a back and purple and pea-green lake, with
<br/>hills and trees of the same complexion: but our magnificent
<br/>bay has not been able to furnish either of these New-Yorkers
<br/>an idea for his canvass. We would not have them paint dio-
<br/>ramic views of the bay as some painters attempt to do, and
<br/>so fail of doing any thing, but let them take one ray of light,
<br/>one wave, one hill, one cloud, one sun-set, one of our twi-
<br/>lights, one of our ships or sloops, or barges, or steamboats—
<br/>objects as full of poetry and romantic interest as any that can
<br/>be found in Venice or Naples, and transfer it to their canvass,
<br/>that there may be something on the walls of the Academy
<br/>to appeal to the understandings and touch the hearts of those
<br/>who crowd to look upon them. The great defect of every
<br/>one of our landscape painters is an ambition to do everything
<br/>upon one canvass. But in nature the eye will make for itself
<br/>a point of interest, for it can comprehend but one thing at a
<br/>time. Therefore the artist should never attempt to make
<br/>two pictures on one canvass, for the eye cannot accommo-
<br/>date itself to both, and in glancing from one to the other,
<br/>the interest of both will be destroyed. When we walk into
<br/>the fields, or climb a mountain, or go out to sea, the eye and
<br/>mind immediately seek out a particular object for contempla-
<br/>tion, and all except the object selected immediately becomes
<br/>a confused blank. If we look at a rock near by, we cannot
<br/>see the distant hills; if we look at a flower at our feet, we
<br/>cannot see the tree above our heads; if we gaze at the
<br/>purple hills in the distance, we lose the green ones near by.
<br/>A painter, therefore, should select his point of interest, and
<br/>invest it with all the life and truth that his powers will al-
<br/>low, and only try to avoid giving the same degree of finish to
<br/>any other part of his picture ; then the spectator will have a
<br/>key to his thoughts, and be spared the perplexity of trying to
<br/>discern what he desired to accomplish. The pictures by Cole
<br/>and Durand, in the present exhibition, contain within them-
<br/>selves dozens of other pictures, and the eye wanders from
<br/>object to object, from sight to shadow, from men here to cat-
<br/>tle yonder, seeking in vain after repose and a point to pause
<br/>and hold communion with the artist. The Landscape, 39,
<br/>by Durand, is wearying both to the eye and the mind, be-
<br/>cause you keep travelling over it for a place to rest upon and
<br/>begin to drink its beauty. Here is an old man sitting in the
<br/>cool shadow of the trees—you, are content to sit and rest
<br/>also, and as you look upon him, sympathise with his feel-
<br/>ings—but you cannot rest; a group of young men playing at
<br/>ball are twitching away your eyes and distracting your
<br/>thoughts; you pass to them, but beyond is a glimpse of
<br/>bewitching sun-shine stealing through the trees which you
<br/>must enjoy, and you leave the cricketers for the sun-shine,
<br/>and that for the people at the farm-house door, and them for
<br/>the man with the load of hay, and him for the clump of
<br/>chesnut trees, and them for the objects in the foreground. The
<br/>mind is wearied and dissatisfied ; the heart is not touched—
<br/>you feel pettish and—without knowing what to find fault
<br/>with, for the picture is really made up of most admirable
<br/>materials—condemn it in your heart while you pronounce it
<br/>with your tongue a magnificent work.</p>
              <p>There is hardly a landscape in the rooms in which you
<br/>can discover with certainty the intent of the painter, beyond
<br/>the very obvious one of catching the eye of a gaping crowd.
<br/>There are a few which seem to have been painted with a
<br/>sentiment of Nature in the artist's mind, and these make the
<br/>most forcible appeal to the heart of the spectator. No. 37,
<br/>a study from Nature, by Cropsey, is a very truthful picture;
<br/>the rocks are the best of any in the exhibition; the shadows
<br/>are clear and distinct; the light pure and bright, and the lit-
<br/>tle bit of water is limpid and cool, although it is smooth as a
<br/>mirror. The picture does not stand out from the canvass, as
<br/>we hear amateurs absurdly say, sometimes, when they mis-
<br/>take the gross faults of a painting for its beauties, but it takes
<br/>you into the canvass as you stand and look at it, and if you
<br/>saw it by itself, would doubtless make you forget that you
<br/>were looking at a picture at all. The pictures in a promis-
<br/>cuous collection are seen lo very great disadvantage; the eye
<br/>and the mind are distracted by the varieties of style, of objects
<br/>and of color. Artists paint to attract admirers, and modest
<br/>nature is trampled upon like violets in a garden of sun-flow-
<br/>ers. No. 177, an October landscape, by J. R. Bleecker, is a
<br/>charming little bit of tender feeling ; an artist whose love of
<br/>the true and beautiful leads him to scorn the flaunting gew-
<br/>gaws by which vulgar minds seek to gain applause, and
<br/>contents himself to copy nature as he finds her, will run the
<br/>risk of being thrust into a bye-place as this little painting has<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>been. But he should work on and bide his time—his day
<br/>will dawn by-and-bye. There is a most charming little
<br/>painting by Mr. Casilear, in the rooms of the Art-Union in
<br/>Broadway, which should have been sent to the exhibition.
<br/>It is a perfectly painted oak tree, with a couple of horses
<br/>resting in its shadow ; it is very simple, very highly finished,
<br/>and full of genuine love of nature and high artistic expres-
<br/>sion. It is worth an acre of the stumps of trees, and maho-
<br/>gany looking rocks which occupy so large a part of the walls
<br/>of the National Academy.</p>

<br/>mising pictures in the exhibition. They are very strongly
<br/>marked by a decided manner; but the artist was born a land-
<br/>scape painter, and his manner must be rather a choice than
<br/>a necessity. He must look a little closer into Nature, and
<br/>free himself of his present manner, before it becomes a de-
<br/>cided habit. The best part of his picture is the drawing;
<br/>the color is monotonous and untrue.</p>

<br/>the picture is too large for the subject. Mr. Cranch has four

              <p>88. View across Frenchman's Bay from Mount Desert
<br/>Island, after a squall—T. Cole. This is the only marine
<br/>picture that we have seen by Mr. Cole. The water is well
<br/>drawn, but not well colored, and the rocks are of a kind that
<br/>no geologist would find a name for; the whole coast of
<br/>Maine is lined with rocks nearly black in color, and tinged
<br/>with a greenish hue, as all marine rcoks are. These in Mr.
<br/>Coles’s picture are red. An artist should be something of a
<br/>geologist to paint rocky scenes correctly, as he should be a
<br/>botanist to paint flowers, and an anatomist to paint the hu-
<br/>man form. The picture is a good deal too large. So wide a
<br/>surface for so meagre a subject must be filled up chiefly with
<br/>common places ; a few inches of canvass will serve to convey
<br/>as vivid an idea of the sea, if properly covered, as a yard;
<br/>as much breadth of effect can be given in the palm of your
<br/>hand, as on a canvass twenty feet wide; why, then, should
<br/>artists waste their materials in painting enormous pictures,
<br/>whose sizes alone will prevent their being purchased. No.
<br/>97, by the same artist, is too large for any ordinary room,
<br/>and the sublime idea of the subject is lost in its expansion.
<br/>We have been told that this great picture was painted in
<br/>four days, which is time enough, but if it had been painted
<br/>within the space of four inches, it would have been infinitely
<br/>more impressive. 178—a sunset, is one of Mr. Cole's weak-
<br/>est pictures ; it is evidently a composition, and it appears to
<br/>worse advantage for being put in an oval frame. Mr. Cole
<br/>still reigns supreme in landscape, as we doubt not he will
<br/>long continue to do. But he does not always paint with the
<br/>same power. His two pictures in the rooms of the Art-Union
<br/>are much finer than either of those in the exhibition; they
<br/>are among the very best American landscapes ever painted.</p>

<br/>A Paradise of flowers.
<br/>I see the shade the willow throws,

<br/>The forest-walk, the waterfall,
<br/>Where oft in youth I met
<br/>A fair young girl, whose lustrous eyes
<br/>No longer smile or weep, 
<br/>For in the church-yard lone she lies,
<br/>In deep and dreamless sleep.
<br/>There is no old familiar place
<br/>Beloved in boyish years,

         <div class="head">LIVING ARTISTS OF EUROPE. No. 2. HORACE VERNET.</div>
          <p>Three generations of the family of Vernet have rendered
<br/>the name famous in the annals of the French school. They
<br/>were originally from Avignon, in which city was born Jo-
<br/>seph Vernet, the grandfather of the subject of this notice, and
<br/>the first of the three celebrated men, each of whom, in his
<br/>time, has so identified himself with the progress of Art. The
<br/>father of Joseph Vernet was a landscape painter, by whom it
<br/>is said there exist in the department of Vaucluse creditable
<br/>examples of talent. Marine painting was the department of
<br/>Art in which Joseph Vernet excelled, and in this he surpass-
<br/>ed all the French artists of his time. His son, Carl Vernet,
<br/>acquired an extensive reputation from his historical pictures
<br/>and battle pieces; this last is the father of the yet more fa-
<br/>mous Vernet of our own epoch.</p>
            <p>Jean Emile Horace Vernet was born in Paris on the 30th
<br/>of June, 1789, in the Louvre, in which palace both his fa-
<br/>ther and grandfather occupied apartments. Born at a period
<br/>when education was little cared for in France, he was aban-
<br/>doned almost entirely to the guidance of his own natural in-
<br/>tonations, which, in default of that kind of instruction,<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>adapted for children of his age, turned his undivided atten-
<br/>tion to Art. He exhibited, therefore, very early, a capacity
<br/>for drawing—crayons and pencils were his first toys, and his
<br/>practice with these he soon began to aid with a knowledge
<br/>of anatomy and perspective. His first instructions in draw-
<br/>ing he received from his father, and he afterwards worked
<br/>some time in the atelier of M. Vincent, a painter of some
<br/>celebrity under the Consulate.</p>
            <p>The first money received by Horace Vernet, in the exer-
<br/>cise of his profession, was while he was yet in childhood :
<br/>in boyhood he was an independent member of the Art. At
<br/>the age of eleven years he made a drawing of a tulip for
<br/>Madame de Perigord, for which she paid him twenty-four
<br/>sous; and at the age of thirteen he had commissions inso-
<br/>much as to be in a condition to support himself. One of his
<br/>earliest efforts was the vignette which, according to the taste
<br/>of the times, headed the card of invitation to the imperial
<br/>hunting parties, which was of such merit that an engraver
<br/>of considerable reputation—Duplessis Bertaut—did not hesi-
<br/>tate to pronounce it worthy of his own burin.</p>
            <p>Commissions began to flow in upon the young Vernet—
<br/>drawings at six francs, and pictures at twenty. He worked
<br/>principally for the Journal des Modes, for which he became
<br/>the acknowledged draughtsman ; and it was, perhaps, from
<br/>his experience in this department of Art, that he acquired
<br/>that power in caricature with which he even now amuses
<br/>his intimate friends ; and often at their own cost.</p>
            <p>Carle Vernet, who had gained the travelling pension,
<br/>wished his son should win the same distinction ; but Horace
<br/>failed in competition for this honor, as he had already done
<br/>upon every occasion hitherto of his disputing the academic
<br/>palm. The taste for classic history and mythology prevailed
<br/>at this time in its full force in France, and Horace Vernet
<br/>was among the first of the French artists who saw that the
<br/>Greeks and Romans had already had their day, and to un-
<br/>derstand that he was one of those who were assisting at a
<br/>grand crisis in Art, in conjunction with a grand crisis in his-
<br/>tory, and that the particular period would claim for itself
<br/>those great men who should signalize themselves amid the
<br/>turmoil of their times. Moved by a natural inclination for a
<br/>military life, and having served some time in the ranks of
<br/>the French army, he was an enthusiastic admirer of Napole-
<br/>on ; it is not, therefore, surprising that he should have early
<br/>devoted himself to the celebration of the achievements of the
<br/>French armies and their adored chief; and, although his
<br/>power is universal, it is yet in this kind of composition in
<br/>which we find it most emphatically pronounced.</p>
            <p>In order to check a strong inclination for a military career,
<br/>he was induced by his father to marry at an early age; thus
<br/>at twenty he took upon himself the cares of a household, for
<br/>which, as his family was rich only in reputation, his exer-
<br/>tions were now taxed to provide; hence, to those habits of
<br/>industry, seconded by his marvellous facility of execution, he
<br/>is indebted for the reputation of being the most prolific artist
<br/>that ever existed, having, up to the present time, made more
<br/>than 1200 drawings, nearly 1000 portraits, all of important
<br/>persons, and at least 300 pictures, many of which are large
<br/>and complex compositions.</p>
            <p>In 1814 he was enrolled in the Legion of Honor for the
<br/>active part which he had taken in the defence of Paris; and
<br/>in 1925 he was promoted to the grade of officer by Charles
<br/>X.; and in 1842 he was appointed commander of the order,
<br/>by the present king of the French, a distinction at which he,
<br/>of all the French School of Art, has alone arrived. In 1826
<br/>he was elected a member of the Institute, where, in the
<br/>class of Fine Arts, he took his place by the side of his father,
<br/>who long before him had been similarly placed in the old
<br/>Academy of Painting.</p>
            <p>In August, 1828, Horace Vernet was appointed Director
<br/>of the French Academy at Rome, an office which he filled
<br/>until the first of January, 1839. During his residence at
<br/>Rome M. Vernet sent as a present to Charles X. an admira-
<br/>ble portrait of Pope Pius VIII., which is ranked among the
<br/>best productions of its author, and now occupies a place in
<br/>the Museum at Versailles. The king, being charmed with
<br/>this act of graceful homage, caused the secretary of the em-
<br/>bassy to Rome to be charged to ascertain what return on the
<br/>part of the king would be most grateful and flattering to the
<br/>artist; and to learn particularly whether the title of baron
<br/>would be agreeable to him. The office of discovering his
<br/>feelings in this latter respect fell to the lot of one of his par-
<br/>ticular friends, to whom he replied—“The name of Vernet<div class="pagebreak" id="#page278"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>for a painter seems to me sufficiently good without any ho-
<br/>norary title ; the name has shot forth from the crowd, and,
<br/>in my opinion, the title of baron would again obscure it; but
<br/>if his Majesty (as you assure me he is) be disposed to accord
<br/>me that which would afford me the greatest pleasure, say
<br/>that I pray his Majesty to grant the distinction of the Legion
<br/>of Honour to M. Dumont, a sculptor, and one of our pension-
<br/>naires, who has just executed a group of the highest merit.”</p>
            <p>Vernet was not made a baron, nor did Dumont upon that
<br/>occasion receive the cross, although he has since acquired
<br/>that honor, and even been also enrolled a member of the In-
<br/>stitute.</p>
            <p>When the revolution of 1830 broke out, the whole of the
<br/>French legation at Rome retired to Naples, where the am-
<br/>bassador had already been for some time, and thus the Di-
<br/>rector of the Academy was left at Rome alone, the only
<br/>French functionary that remained there, in which position of
<br/>affairs M. Veruet was nominated the diplomatic representa-
<br/>tive of France at the Holy See—a signal distinction for an
<br/>artist—with full powers to treat directly with the Papal Go-
<br/>vernment, and amid circumstances of great difficulty. He
<br/>acquitted himself, however, with such firmness and judg-
<br/>ment as to gain the entire and unqualified approbation of the
<br/>French government; the expression of which was conveyed
<br/>to him in a letter written by M. Guizot, then Minister of the
<br/>Interior.</p>
            <p>The manner in which this great artist relaxes from his
<br/>professional labors is by travel ; and during these periods of
<br/>diversion he has visited many distant countries, as Egypt,
<br/>Syria, and Algeria, as well as having travelled through all
<br/>the European states, and having been presented to almost all
<br/>the sovereigns who have lived in his time. He possesses an
<br/>assemblage of endowments with which few men have been
<br/>gifted, or at least, being so, have turned to such account.
<br/>His conversation is light, most agreeable, and full of anec-
<br/>dote, and, under apparent inattention, be conceals a deep and
<br/>penetrating observation. His memory is singularly reten-
<br/>tive of facts, forms, and localities, insomuch that he can de-
<br/>scribe with exactitude, and after a lapse of years, a place
<br/>which he may have seen but once ; and so entirely has he
<br/>reduced this wonderful force of memory to professional pur-
<br/>poses, that he can paint the portrait of a person with whom
<br/>he may have passed an hour in conversation. His reading is
<br/>confined almost to the Bible; it was the Scriptures that first
<br/>inspired him with the desire of visiting the East; and with
<br/>respect to his travels in the Holy Land, after close and elabo-
<br/>rate research, and observation, he declares his conviction,
<br/>that the habits and costumes of the Arabs of the present day,
<br/>are, with little change, the same as they were in the days
<br/>of the patriarchs. As regards the long catalogue of his
<br/>works, this is to be explained by reference to his teeming
<br/>imagination and happy adaptation of subject-matter, rapidity
<br/>of execution, earnestness of purpose, and uninterrupted good
<br/>health. Albeit his works are so numerous, and of charac-
<br/>ter so diverse, he cannot anywhere be charged with imi-
<br/>tation—it is sufficiently evident in all that the inspira-
<br/>tion is from actual nature, or has its source in his own
<br/>vivid imagery—and this is the more apparent that in his
<br/>works there is no self-repetition. Observation and study
<br/>of nature are considered by him two grand principles of ex-
<br/>cellence. As Professor of the School of Fine Arts, his in-
<br/>structions are considered by the students more serviceable
<br/>than those of any of the other eleven professors. It is not
<br/>the classes alone of this admirable institution that profit by
<br/>the instructions of M. Vernet; nor is it merely to his own
<br/>countrymen that they are confined ; for he receives in his own
<br/>atelier, with the utmost kindness and amenity, students of
<br/>all nations, to whom he offers freely his valuable counsel
<br/>and best advice. With respect to the measure and the re-
<br/>ward of his labors, of these he never thinks in comparison ;
<br/>for the picture which he intends as a work of love, or a sim-
<br/>ple gift, he elaborates as highly as that for which he receives
<br/>a princely reward.</p>
            <p>Like all men of superior genius, M. Vernet has his ardent
<br/>admirers and determined detractors; but the test of time and
<br/>the public voice are of infinitely more weight than such a
<br/>complexity of praise and censure. Thirty years of success,
<br/>and an ever-increasing popularity, have placed Horace Ver-
<br/>net in the highest rank of the profession of Art—a position
<br/>awarded to him first by the mass of his countrymen, and
<br/>acknowledged by the rest of Europe.</p>
            <p>The works of no artist are more extensively known, or<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>more eminently popular than those of M. Vernet, because
<br/>in the commonest human incidents he sees pictures: and
<br/>gives, accordingly, a version of them which comes at once
<br/>home to the heart. Horace Vernet has been the first to break
<br/>decidedly away from the dull classic formality of the French
<br/>School, and to exhibit to its members the real fingering of
<br/>the chords of the social affections.</p>

<br/>Upon the quiet mountain top,
<br/>Steals drowsily and musically
<br/>Into the universal valley.
<br/>The rosemary nods upon the grave ;
<br/>The lily lolls upon the wave;
<br/>Wrapping the fog about its breast,

<br/>Looking like Lethe, see ! the lake
<br/>A conscious slumber seems to take,
<br/>And would not, for the world, awake.
<br/>All Beauty sleeps !—and lo ! where lies
<br/>(Her casement open to the skies)
<br/>Irene, with her Destinies !
<br/>Oh, lady bright ! can it be right—
<br/>This window open to the night ?
<br/>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
<br/>Laughingly through the lattice drop—
<br/>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
<br/>Flit through thy chamber in and out,
<br/>And wave the curtain canopy
<br/>So fitfully—so fearfully—
<br/>Above the closed and fringed lid
<br/>’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid,
<br/>That, o’er the floor and down the wall,
<br/>Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
<br/>Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear ?
<br/>Why and what art thou dreaming here ?
<br/>Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,
<br/>A wonder to these garden trees !
<br/>Strange is thy pallor ! strange thy dress !
<br/>Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
<br/>And this all solemn silentness!
<br/>The lady sleeps ! Oh, may her sleep,
<br/>Which is enduring, so be deep
<br/>Heaven have her in its sacred keep !
<br/>This chamber changed for one more holy,
<br/>This bed for one more melancholy,
<br/>I pray to God that she may lie
<br/>Forever with unopen’d eye,
<br/>While the dim sheeted ghosts go by !
<br/>My love, she sleeps ! Oh, may her sleep,
<br/>As it is lasting, so be deep !
<br/>Soft may the worms about her creep !
<br/>Far in the forest, dim and old,
<br/>For her may some toll vault unfold—
<br/>Some vault that oft hath flung its black
<br/>And winged pannels fluttering back,
<br/>Triumphant, o’er the crested palls
<br/>Of her grand family funerals—
<br/>Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
<br/>Against whose portal she hath thrown,
<br/>In childhood, many an idle stone—
<br/>Some tomb from out whose sounding door
<br/>She ne’er shall force an echo more,
<br/>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin !
<br/>It was the dead who groaned within.</div>

         <div class="head">THE GRATEFUL CLERK,
A TALE  FOUNDED ON FACTS.</div>
          <p>Mr. Hubs was head salesman in the wholesale jobbing
<br/>store of Hinks and Whipple; he was looked upon as one of
<br/>the best judges of satinets in Cedar street, as he well might
<br/>be, for he was a judge of nothing else. He knew nothing of
<br/>men, manners, metaphysics, or muslins: nothing of politics,
<br/>pictures, poetry, or poplins; of sects, sciences, or satins. He
<br/>knew nothing of literature, linens, or love. No, he knew
<br/>nothing about love, although he thought that he did, for a
<br/>young lady in Division street, whose mother kept a fancy
<br/>store, by some witchery induced Mr. Hubs to offer himself;
<br/>he did so because he thought that he was in love: but any-
<br/>body who had ever been in that condition, could tell at a
<br/>glance that John Hubs was a stranger to the passion. His
<br/>forehead was too narrow, and the back part of his head was
<br/>all shrunk away, or rather it had never been filled out.
<br/>There was no more love in him than in a winter squash.
<br/>It was his misfortune that he could not love. Poor Hubs!
<br/>I could sooner spare a tear for such a fellow-being, than for
<br/>the loss of an estate like Astor’s. To live in a world which
<br/>has nothing in it but love worth living for, and to be denied
<br/>that!</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that Hubs had a faint impression that he
<br/>was in love, it is by no means certain that he would have
<br/>married for that reason alone. His employers had made an
<br/>addition of two hundred dollars per annum to his salary, and
<br/>he thought that a wife would be very convenient tohelp him
<br/>spend it. He could not spend his salary before it was rais-
<br/>ed, how then could he do so with so great an addition to it?</p>
            <p>By some accident his employers heard that their salesman
<br/>was going to get married on a certain day, for Hubs could
<br/>not brace up his nerves to announce the fact himself. He
<br/>was fearful that they might not approve of so rash an under-
<br/>taking, and he had not the courage to act contrary to their
<br/>wishes. The night before the great day that was to see
<br/>Hubs a married man, he called Mr. Hinks, the senior part-
<br/>ner, aside, with the intention of asking leave of absence for a
<br/>week ; for the lady’s friends had planned out a wedding
<br/>tour to the Springs, for Hubs and his bride. But Mr. Hinks,
<br/>being fond of a joke when it was not played off at his own
<br/>expense, and suspecting the nature of his salesman’s commu-
<br/>nication, did not give him time to open his mouth, but in-
<br/>formed him that he must go into New Jersey the next morn-
<br/>ing by daybreak, to look after a delinquent customer. The
<br/>terrified client looked as horror-struck at this announcement
<br/>as he well could, and before he could gather together his as-
<br/>tonished senses, stammered out that he could not go.</p>
            <p>“ Can’t go, sir!” exclaimed Mr. Hinks in a voice that was
<br/>widely at variance with the expression of his face, as Hubs
<br/>might have seen if he had looked at him. “But you must
<br/>go, Mr. Hubs. Can’t go ! Bless my buttons, Mr. Hubs, I
<br/>never heard such an expression before."</p>
            <p>“ I’m engaged to —to —" stammered Hubs.</p>
            <p>“ Engaged to what, sir ?” said Mr. Hinks fiercely, “ engag-
<br/>ed to what, sir? I had an idea that you were engaged to
<br/>the firm of Hinks and Whipple, sir. Have we not raised
<br/>your salary two hundred dollars, Mr. Hubs?”</p>
            <p>“ You have," replied Hubs, “ I have not forgotten it, and
<br/>I never can; but I have got a little engagement on my hands
<br/>which I cannot well put off, and I should be glad to have a
<br/>week’s liberty, if it be possible.”</p>
            <p>“ It is impossible, quite impossible,” replied the inveterate
<br/>jobber, with great seriousness, "times are hard and business
<br/>must not be neglected."</p>
            <p>Hubs was beginning to look most uncomfortably pale, and
<br/>Mr. Hinks was afraid to carry ibe joke further.</p>
            <p>“ Well, Mr. Hubs, since you must go,” said his employer,
<br/>“I will despatch Mr. Putty, the book-keeper, into New Jersey,
<br/>and here is a trifle to pay for your wedding suit.” Where-
<br/>upon he handed Hubs a check for a hundred dollars and then
<br/>broke loose into a most unjobber-like explosion of mirth, in
<br/>which he was joined by Mr. Whipple and all the junior
<br/>clerks who had been watching all the proceedings and dying
<br/>for their employer to give them the cue, that they might
<br/>laugh at poor Hubs, who was so overcome that he was forc-
<br/>ed to walk off to some dark nook where he could give utter-
<br/>ance to a heart full of feelings, which had been gathering
<br/>like water in a mill-dam after a sudden thaw.</p>
            <p>It would have been a difficult matter to decide whether<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Hubs or his employer went home with the lighter heart that
<br/>night. There can be no doubt that, generally speaking, the
<br/>giver of a gift is a happier person than the receiver ; and if
<br/>men would but bear this fact in mind there can be as little
<br/>doubt, that gifts would become more common than they are.</p>
            <p>Hubs made his appearance the next morning in Division
<br/>street, in a white satin stock and a Marseilles vest: the mar-
<br/>riage passed off without an accident, the tour was accom-
<br/>plished, and time’s wheels rolled round as smoothly and as
<br/>swiftly as though nothing remarkable had happened. In the
<br/>first wild tumult of his feelings, Hubs made a silent vow
<br/>that his first-born should be called, in honor of his employer,
<br/>Hinks. But, two years had already flown by and he had
<br/>not, for a very sufficient reason, performed his vow. His
<br/>grateful feelings, however, had not diminished in the slight-
<br/>est degree, and he wished for nothing so ardently as for an
<br/>opportunity to manifest them. It is true that Hubs had at
<br/>times wished that his employer had been in earnest about
<br/>sending him into New Jersey to look after a delinquent cus-
<br/>tomer, or that something else had happened to prevent his
<br/>marriage. Not that the matrimonial state was not all that
<br/>he anticipated, but it proved to be a vast deal more ; but
<br/>that was no fault of his employers.</p>
            <p>Hubs occupied a little frame house in the outskirts of the
<br/>city, with a little dusty garden attached to it, containing a
<br/>woful looking lilac bush and two very dirty poplars. He
<br/>had selected this spot because he was growing dyspeptic
<br/>and his physician had recommended a country residence;
<br/>and had it not been for a tannery and glue factory in his im-
<br/>mediate neighborhood it would have been quite delightful.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hinks had a remarkable excrescence on his right cheek,
<br/>generally of an ashy color, but every autumn it assumed a
<br/>very peculiar yellowish hue. People said that he was
<br/>marked with a cantelupe. However that may be, it is cer-
<br/>tain that he was extravagantly fond of that kind of fruit, and
<br/>while they lasted he hardly ate of anything but muskmelons.</p>
            <p>Hubs was well acquainted with his employer’s appetite,
<br/>and he determined to raise some of the finest cantelupes in
<br/>his little garden that the world had ever seen, and present
<br/>them to him. It was a happy thought, and so completely
<br/>took possession of his brain that he could think of nothing else.
<br/>Even satinets became a weariness to him, It was before
<br/>the frost was out of the ground that the idea occurred to him,
<br/>and he could hardly wait for the sun to soften the soil so that
<br/>he could begin to plant. But while he was waiting for the
<br/>season to roll round, he read through half a dozen num-
<br/>bers of the Farmer’s Almanac in search of agricultural
<br/>knowledge. It had never occurred to him before that cante-
<br/>lupes required any particular mode of culture. He thought,
<br/>if he ever thought on the subject at all, that they grew
<br/>spontaneously. He knew that they were always to be found
<br/>in the market at a certain season of the year, but how they
<br/>got there was a matter entirely beyond the circle of his
<br/>thoughts. It was a thing of course, and that was all he
<br/>knew about it. But his new course of study opened to him
<br/>a world of pleasures. Every fact that he found out proved
<br/>a new delight. Once he looked upon an acquaintance with
<br/>the different qualities of satinets as the highest kind of know-
<br/>ledge but he now found turnips and cauliflowers a source
<br/>of amusement and profit. The whole vegetable world was
<br/>suddenly invested with most marvellous properties that excit-
<br/>ed the utmost astonishment in his mind. He looked upon a
<br/>potato with feelings bordering on veneration when he learn-
<br/>ed that that humble vegetable was compounded of starch,
<br/>water, albumen, sugar, poison fatty matter, parenchyma,
<br/>malic acid and salts; and the knowledge that a simple little
<br/>green weed, as soon as it thrusts its innocent head above the
<br/>earth begins to imbibe carbonic acid and oxide of ammonia
<br/>from the surrounding atmosphere, and that it produces hydro-
<br/>gen, fixes azote and abstracts electricity, made him regard
<br/>the grass beneath his feet with affection. He had no idea
<br/>that there was such instinct in plants. The trees in the Park,
<br/>the flowers in street windows, the vegetables in the market,
<br/>and the fruits on street stalls, all attracted his attention, not
<br/>as things of traffic or of nourishment, but as organized exis-
<br/>tences obeying the laws of their own being, and showing
<br/>forth the glory and goodness of their Maker as plainly, and
<br/>as abundantly as his own species. He wondered at his for-
<br/>mer darkness, and he began to perceive what an abundance
<br/>of lovable things there are in the world.</p>
            <p>O what a blessing is knowledge! thought Mr. Hubs.
<br/>How it enhances our delights, lessens our griefs, gives a rel-
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page280"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>ish to labor, makes even poverty cheerful, and takes from
<br/>death itself more than half its terrors.</p>            
            <p>His acquisitions of knowledge were very small indeed, and
<br/>confined entirely to the manufacture of satinets and the cul-
<br/>ture of cantelupes, and yet such was the liberal effect of sci-
<br/>ence on his mind that he could have clasped the whole world
<br/>to his heart if his wife had been out of it. His little insight
<br/>into the mysteries of vegetable germination had given him
<br/>a vague feeling of awe for his mother earth, although it was
<br/>mainly as the great parent of cantelupes that he reverenced
<br/>her, and he looked with growing impatience for the time to
<br/>arrive when he should be permitted to scratch her back with
<br/>his iron rake, and root up the weeds from her face as a pi-
<br/>ous child would pull the intrusive hairs from the chin of his
<br/>grandmother.</p>
            <p>He had exhausted his almanacs, hut his thirst for know-
<br/>ledge had increased in proportion to his acquisitions, as a
<br/>miser grows covetous as he grows rich, and he now supplied
<br/>himself with a paper of seeds and Bridgman’s darling little
<br/>Gardener’s Assistant at the same time, and took them home
<br/>with the feelings of a philosopher. His wife scolded him
<br/>smartly for his extravagance, but he bore all her womanly
<br/>reproaches with the equanimity of a Socrates, and only re-
<br/>plied to her long lecture, “wait and see.’’ That the reader
<br/>may know to what extent Hubs carried his philosophy, we
<br/>will give a short extract from one of his help-mate's exerci-
<br/> tations.</p>
            <p>“ Goodness me ? What is that, a book ? A nasty book !
<br/>Well, now we shall starve! Mother always said so. I
<br/>never new a man worth anything who was always lazying
<br/>away his time over books. Well, I see what my fate will
<br/>be. I shall have to go home to my mother’s. I won’t work
<br/>to support a loafer, not I. You had better have given me
<br/>that money to buy a breast pin. I told you yesterday I
<br/>wanted a brooch to put my brother’s hair in. You silly
<br/>thing, what good will a book do you ? O, yes, I seem to see
<br/>you.	Aint you going to set up for a literary character. O
<br/>my!	I should n’t wonder. You told me yesterday you
<br/>could’nt afford to go to the theatre, and there you have went
<br/>and thrown away your money for a good-for-nothing book.
<br/>But I’ll go to the theatre if I live, and to the museum too, and
<br/>I’ll treat myself and my sister to ice creams and soda water
<br/>at Thompson’s. See if I don’t. I never done such an ex-
<br/>travagant thing as to buy a book, nor my mother before me.
<br/>I have got that to be thankful for. Goodness me, no! I
<br/>come from good respectable folks, who knew no more about
<br/>books than the pope of Rome. But don’t leave your book in
<br/>my reach, mister ; if you do, into the fire it goes, I can prom-
<br/>ise you.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Hubs’s two years of matrimonial trials had given him
<br/>somewhat of an insight into the peculiarities of the female
<br/>character, and he well knew the consequences of attempting
<br/>to convince his wife that she had taken hold of the wrong
<br/>of the question ; so he merely answered, “ wait and see,”
<br/>and resolved to profit by her caution, and keep his precious
<br/>little treatise under lock and key.</p>
            <p>His grounds only measured twenty five feet by forty, and
<br/>as one portion of them was used as a grass plat for bleaching
<br/>clothes, and a large slice was taken up by a gravel walk, it
<br/>will readily be perceived that his garden could not be very
<br/>extensive. But it was large enough for his desires, and he
<br/>looked upon his little enclosure with the feelings of a land-
<br/>holder. It is doubtful whether the rich Mr. Wadsworth,
<br/>who owns half the Genessee flats, ever felt as grand as Mr.
<br/>Hubs did when he first stuck his shovel into the ground to
<br/>commence the cultivation of cantelupes.</p>
            <p>Ambition always will overleap its mark. Hubs planted
<br/>his cantelupe seed at least a fortnight too soon, and they all 
<br/>rotted in the ground. After waiting an unreasonable time
<br/>to see the young vines show their little heads above ground
<br/>he was obliged to rake open the hills and plant afresh. Ev-
<br/>ery morning he got up with the sun, and sometimes before,
<br/>to watch his seeds, and see if they had burst from their dark
<br/>hiding places ; and as the dews were copious and the sun
<br/>warm, he soon had the delight of seeing their delicate leaves,
<br/>like outspread hands, throw aside the earthy particles which
<br/>covered them, and salute the uprising sun with a grateful
<br/>smile, like a new born infant gazing into the face of its pa-
<br/>rent. Surely never before did a tiller of the soil experience
<br/>such delightful sensations as those which agitated the breast
<br/>of Mr. Hubs on this occasion. He could not help running back
<br/>to the bedside of his sleeping wife to beg that she would<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>come down and look at his cantelupes. But his “ last best
<br/>gift” did not relish his intrusion at such an unseasonable
<br/>hour, and she turned upon him with a How of expressions
<br/>that our respect for her sex will not permit us to repeat. He
<br/>left her to sleep on, and when he took his seat in the omni-
<br/>bus to go to his daily occupation of selling satinets, he felt
<br/>like a new man. He tried to appear as humble as he could,
<br/>but he experienced an uncomfortable feeling of superiority
<br/>in spite of himself, which he had never felt before. All day
<br/>his thoughts were wandering away to his cantelupes. He
<br/>was impatient to get back to them. A long-winded custo-
<br/>mer front Vermont detained him forever, as it appeared to
<br/>him, just as he was about to leave the store, and it was al-
<br/>most dark when he reached home. Before he would sit
<br/>down to his supper, he rushed out to look at his young troop
<br/>of vegetable earlings. But, alas! for human anticipations !
<br/>The cantelupes had disappeared; vanished from mortal sight
<br/>as though they had never been. The had been cruelly, bar-
<br/>barously cut off in the morning of their existence. He could
<br/>have wept over their loss, bnt tears would avail them noth-
<br/>ing. Their fate was shrouded in deep mystery. Nobody
<br/>knew how it was done. Mrs. Hubs was profoundly ignorant
<br/>of the matter, and Bridget was willing to take her Bible oath
<br/>that she knew no more about the “ young millions” than the
<br/>child unborn. Mr. Hubs, of course, could not compel peo-
<br/>ple to confess what they did not know, and he went to his bed
<br/>in a state of miserable ignorance about the premature disap-
<br/>pearance of his darling vegetables. But he had a horrible
<br/>suspicion, which kept him awake half the night, that he was
<br/>the victim of a wicked conspiracy between the wife of his bo-
<br/>som and her servant-maid.</p>
            <p>He was not to be daunted, however, for he had been edu-
<br/>cated in a school which knows no such word as despair.
<br/>By dawn the next morning he was planting fresh seeds, hav-
<br/>ing put them to soak in warm lye over night. But Hubs
<br/>was doomed once more to disappointment; he had not been
<br/>seated five minutes in the omnibus when a scoundrel cock,
<br/>belonging to a sporting neighbor, walked deliberately into
<br/>the hall door, which had been left open by Bridget, and
<br/>strutted pompously into the garden, where, without the
<br/>slightest hesitation, he scratched up every individual seed,
<br/>and when he had stowed them away in his remorseless maw
<br/>gave three loud exulting “cock-a-doodle-doos,” and flew
<br/>over the fence into his master’s premises. It was the cool-
<br/>est performance that was ever seen, and when the unhappy
<br/>clerk was told of it, his wrath was too big for words. He
<br/>doubled his fists, stamped his feet, aud looked about him for
<br/>some object upon which to wreak his vengeance ; but there
<br/>was nothing appropriate at hand, so after a moment’s reflec-
<br/>tion he put more seeds in soak, and when he had eaten his
<br/>supper retired to bed, that he might rise with the dawn.</p>
            <p>In due time, and it was a very short time too, for the sun
<br/>was unseasonably hot, he had the happiness to see the little
<br/>leaves once more popping up bright and joyous from the
<br/>earth. He had watched them, and watered them an entire
<br/>week, sprinkling snuff upon them to kill the bugs, and nip-
<br/>ping off the first indications of a runner bud, to strengthen the
<br/>vines and give richness to the fruit, when his wife’s brother
<br/>returned from a long voyage to the Pacific. He was one of
<br/>the best-natured and most restless creatures in the world ;
<br/>like the sea, he would not be quiet a moment, and after he
<br/>had kissed his sister and joked her about her husband, he
<br/>rolled out into the garden and, to make himself useful, took
<br/>up Hubs’s hoe and began, to use his own phrase, “to work
<br/>a traverse among the weeds.”</p>
            <p>“ Goodness me!” exclaimed his sister, “ what have you
<br/>done! You have went and hoed up all of Mr. Hubs’s cante-
<br/>lupes. My, what will he say when he comes home !”</p>
            <p>When Hubs did come home he was soon informed of the
<br/>full extent of his misfortune, but he could not open his
<br/>mouth. It was his wife’s brother who had done the deed,
<br/>and wives’ brothers are always privileged characters. He
<br/>knew moreover, that there was no malice in the act. He
<br/>had the stomach to do anything that was monstrous, if it
<br/>would bring back his vines, but as no desperate deed could
<br/>restore them he had the prudence to eat his supper in a qui-
<br/>et manner, although his mind was in a most unquiet state.
<br/>The young sailor expressed a world of regret for the mis-
<br/>chief he had done, and to console his brother-in-law, told
<br/>him that he had got some first rate melon seeds in the till of
<br/>his chest, which he had brought from round Cape Horn; and
<br/>the next morning bright and early, he brought them up to<div class="pagebreak" id="#page281"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Hubs, who was greatly astonished at the sight of them.
<br/>They were as big as a dozen of those that he planted before.
<br/>The young sailor took a fresh quid of tobacco, and told him
<br/>that he would be more astonished at the fruit. Then they
<br/>both went to work and made fresh hills, and felt once more
<br/>happy at the prospect of beiag able to present his employer
<br/>with some of his favorite fruit. In a week the new seeds
<br/>showed themselves. Never before were such promising
<br/>vines seen. They were so stout, and they grew so rapidly
<br/>that Hubs was in a continual ecstasy of wonder ; but when
<br/>he looked out of his chamber window one morning and saw
<br/>a large yellow blossom on one of the vines his admiration
<br/>was boundless. He ran down to examine it, and was half
<br/>disposed to be angry when he found that it was nothing but
<br/>a male blossom. The vine which bore it grew very rapidly
<br/>in the direction of the garden fence, and Hubs watched it
<br/>with great anxiety to see whether it would run its head
<br/>against the obstruction like a foolish blind creature; and his
<br/>delight was immense when he perceived that it only ap-
<br/>proached within a safe distance, and then turned off to the
<br/>right without rubbing a leaf against the palings. “ You are
<br/>a fine fellow,” said Hubs, speaking to the vine, as though it
<br/>had been furnished with a pair of ears like his own, “ You
<br/>are a fine fellow; yes you are, and I will demolish that ras-
<br/>cal of a caterpillar that is eating one of your big leaves. The
<br/>villain."</p>
            <p>The rains fell, the sun shone bright and warm upon it;
<br/>the gentle summer winds rustled among its great summer
<br/>blossoms and fan like leaves; the dews pearled it in the
<br/>morning and the bees hovered about it all the day long, and
<br/>still the vine grew, trailing its long rope-like body all over
<br/>the garden, to the infinite wonder of all who looked upon it.
<br/>At last a little knob of pale green showed itself in the ex-
<br/>treme end of the vine, and gave promise of fruit. It was
<br/>bailed with rapture by Mr. Hubs, and even his wife conde-
<br/>scended to cast a favorable eye upon it, out of regard to her
<br/>brother, as she said, but in reality because she was fond of
<br/>melons herself, and because she had secretly resolved to in-
<br/>vite all Division street to partake of it as soon as it should
<br/>be ripe.</p>
            <p>Hubs was constantly in a high fever through fear that
<br/>somebody would tread upon the vine, and he cautioned Brid-
<br/>get, on pain of instant dismissal, to be cautious how she
<br/>planted her big feet near it. The young melon promised to
<br/>be a monster, it grew in the space of three days to the size
<br/>of an apple dumpling, and Hubs put some dry leaves under
<br/>it to keep it from decaying; although a slate would have
<br/>been better, as he might have found out by reading Bosc.
<br/>But his researches had not yet extended so far. Neither had
<br/>he stumbled upon Jolyclerc or Linnæus. More was the pity,
<br/>as the reader will discover.</p>
            <p>Hubs regarded the promising appearance of his cantelupe
<br/>with some such feelings as a fond mother looks upon her
<br/>precocious child, and sees in its premature wisdom a sign of
<br/>premature decay. He dared not hope that so remarkable a
<br/>melon would be permitted to arrive at perfection. It was
<br/>too much to think of. And his forebodings were not with-
<br/>out cause, for the phenomenon had not been in existence a
<br/>fortnight when a hungry sow with a litter of pigs broke into
<br/>the enclosure and devoured the precocious vegetable before a
<br/>soul could come to its rescue.</p>
            <p>As the readers of romantic histories are often called upon
<br/>to exercise their imaginations when the descriptive powers
<br/>of the author fail him, they are respectfully requested to do
<br/>so now, for no pen could begin to describe the anguish of
<br/>mind which Mr. Hubs experienced when he was made ac-
<br/>quainted with the disaster which had befallen him. He
<br/>knew of no suitable manner of manifesting his feelings on
<br/>the occasion ; it was a grief without a precedent; so he
<br/>strolled into his garden in a bitter frame of mind, and began
<br/>to kick pettishly at the vines and blossoms which now look-
<br/>ed hateful to him. Soon he kicked over one of the great
<br/>broad leaves, and underneath it he discovered another melon
<br/>larger and fairer than the one that was lost. He clapped
<br/>his hands with delight, and could hardly restrain himself
<br/>from falling on his knees and saluting the precious ob-
<br/>ject.</p>
            <p>Every precaution was now taken to keep out hogs and
<br/>boys and every kind of vermin. The new melon was watch-
<br/>ed over with a degree of solicitude passing belief, and it grew
<br/>to a size far surpassing any melon that had been seen or
<br/>read of. Hubs knew that professor Alpin bad seen melons<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>in Egypt so large that three of them were a load for a camel
<br/>but they were water-melons, and this was a cantelupe.</p>
            <p>Hubs watered the roots of the vine with weak pickle, af-
<br/>ter the Honfleur fashion, to give richness to the fruit; and he
<br/>covered the joints with earth in place of pinching off its run-
<br/>ner buds, to increase its size; for he had already learned
<br/>enough about culture to make him reject the theory of the
<br/>pinchers, and he argued (whether truly or not, we must leave
<br/>others to decide,) that any mutilation of a plant must of ne-
<br/>cessity injure its organization. Who would think of chop-
<br/>ping off his son’s legs, said Hubs, with the expectation of in-
<br/>creasing the length of his son’s arms thereby ?</p>
            <p>By the end of September, the melon had increased to such
<br/>a size that Hubs could hardly lift it off the ground. It had
<br/>begun to assume a rich buff color, nearly as bright as a ripe
<br/>Havana orange, but it did not emit that rich delightful fra-
<br/>grance that ripe cantelupes usually do. But Hubs was fear-
<br/>ful that it would decay, or that some accident might befall
<br/>it if it were kept longer, and he determined to invite his em-
<br/>ployer to partake of it while he was sure of it. In truth, his
<br/>determination was fixed from certain movements on the part
<br/>of his wife having led him to believe that she meditated
<br/>treating her Division street friends to a taste of it.</p>
            <p>A good opportunity having soon occurred, he asked Mr.
<br/>Hinks to do him the favor to go home with him and partake
<br/>of a remarkably fine cantelupe, which he had raised in his
<br/>own garden. The mark on Mr. Hinks’s cheek turned yellow
<br/>as Hubs spoke.</p>
            <p>“By all means,” replied Mr. Hinks, “but is it really a fine
<br/>one, though, Hubs ?”</p>
            <p>“ Very," replied Hubs, who did not care to let out the
<br/>whole truth, for he wished to enjoy his employer’s surprise.</p>
            <p>“ Then I will go to-night,” said Mr. Hinks. “ But, have
<br/>you got no more than one, Hubs ? you know that I am a coon
<br/>at cantelupes.”</p>
            <p>“ I know it, sir,” replied Hubs, “ but it is a caution. Big
<br/>enough to feed the corporation.”</p>
            <p>“First rate, I dare say,” said Mr. Hinks, and he winked
<br/>his right eye knowingly, and smacked his lips, and the mark
<br/>on his cheek glowed with a bright yellowish tinge.</p>
            <p>Hubs exulted inwardly, although he said nothing more in
<br/>praise of his melon; he was burning with impatience to see
<br/>the effect that the great reality would have upon his em-
<br/>ployer.</p>
            <p>As soon as business hours were over they got into an om-
<br/>nibus, a very happy pair of individuals, and in proper time
<br/>were landed in front of Mr. Hubs’s residence. Hubs would
<br/>not allow Mr. Hinks to remain a moment in the house, but
<br/>hurried him out into the garden to show him the miraculous
<br/>cantelupe, lest he should doubt that it grew there.</p>
            <p>“ There it is, sir,” exclaimed Hubs, pointing to the mon-
<br/>ster, “ isn’t it a whaler?”</p>
            <p>“ Where ? where ?” said Mr. Hinks, gazing about.</p>
            <p>“ Here, sir, here,” replied Hubs as he patted the huge veg-
<br/>etable.</p>
            <p>"That!" ejaculated Mr. Hinks, with a very red face.</p>
            <p>“ Just try and lift it, sir,” said Hubs, exultingly.</p>
            <p>“ Hubs,” said Mr. Hinks seriously, while the mark on his
<br/>face changed from a yellowish hue to an ashy paleness,
<br/>"you impertinent rascal, are you making sport of me ?”</p>
            <p>Hubs was paralyzed at the manner of his employer, and
<br/>could not speak a word.</p>
            <p>"I'll have satisfaction for this, sir," said Mr. Hinks, grow-
<br/>ing more and more indignant. “You invite me to your
<br/>house to eat a Valparaiso pumpkin, do you, sir ?"</p>
            <p>“ A Valparaiso pumpkin, sir !” gasped the terrified Hubs,
<br/>and the truth at once flashed upon his mind. “ It was all
<br/>owing to my wife’s brother. O, dear ! and I shall have no
<br/>cantelupe after all!"</p>

              <p>Alnwick Castle, with other Poems. By Fitz-Greene Halleck. New
<br/>York, Harper &amp; Brothers. 1845.</p>
              <p>The system of criticism which obtains among us, and which
<br/>tries the productions of one American mind by those of ano-
<br/>ther, instead of comparing them with some immutable stan-
<br/>dard, or with the best examples in the same kind with which
<br/>other countries have supplied us, has done great injury to the<div class="pagebreak" id="#page282"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
         </p>
         <p>cause of true Art in our Republic. It was our misfortune to
<br/>be in too great a hurry to have a literature of our own. We
<br/>had built up an army and navy: we must build up a litera-
<br/>ture. It was further unanimously resolved that we had a
<br/>national literature; and a score or two of terrified Tompkin-
<br/>ses, who might otherwise have remained life-long the con-
<br/>tented anchorites of the poet’s corner in a village newspaper,
<br/>were suddenly snatched up and set to bear the pitiless storm
<br/>of foreign fun and criticism on the bald lop of our American
<br/>Parnassus. Henceforth every new work was measured by
<br/>the Tompkins yardstick ; and the “precision and elegance,”
<br/>“ the refined dignity,” “ the exuberant humor” of Tompkins
<br/>became proverbial. Under these favorable circumstances,
<br/>the gentlemen thus ostracised from among their fellow citi-
<br/>zens for their country’s fame, plucked up courage, and by
<br/>dint of well-directed energy succeeded in founding what we
<br/>may call the Tompkins dynasty of American literature. A
<br/>court dress of a certain innocuous drab-color was established,
<br/>and any author who was detected without this Tompkins
<br/>uniform was forthwith arrested and thrown into a review, or
<br/>set in the pillory of the newspapers. The heresy of origina-
<br/>lity was everywhere industriously hunted out and crushed ;
<br/>and independence of judgment in criticism was declared to
<br/>be immoral, or, what was far worse, anti-Tompkinsian. If
<br/>man, woman, or child, was unwilling to receive the opinion
<br/>of a Tompkins, how great an insensibility did it display to
<br/>the numerous privileges we enjoy !</p>
            <p>The truth is that we shall never have a literature until we
<br/>become thoroughly persuaded that we have not yet done all
<br/>that is needful to that end, and that it requires at least as
<br/>much previous study and preparation to criticise a work of
<br/>art as a steam engine. We must get over our cant of always
<br/>speaking of certain of our authors and artists as if they filled
<br/>up the majestic round of that circle which even Shakspeare
<br/>did not touch at all points. We must no longer endeavor to
<br/>measure anything really great by the rushlight criticism of
<br/>the Tompkinses, but must look on it in the broad frank sun-
<br/>shine of honest desire after Truth. We must get rid also of
<br/>this unhealthy hankering after a National Literature. The
<br/>best and most enduring literature is that which has no na-
<br/>tionality except of the heart,—that which is the same under
<br/>all languages and under all skies. A poet’s inspiration has
<br/>no more intimate connection with the country in which he
<br/>chances to be bom, than with the village or the garret in
<br/>which he may dwell. While yet a sojourner among our
<br/>mists and shadows, he is made citizen of a higher country,
<br/>whose language is an interpreter throughout the universe,
<br/>and which has no words mean enough to express our paltry
<br/>nationalities, nor indeed any thoughts but such as are primi-
<br/>tive and universal.</p>
            <p>The office of poet, then, is the highest to which any man.
<br/>in these latter times, may aspire. The poet has taken the
<br/>place of the prophet, and, without laying any claim to imme-
<br/>diate inspiration, he yet, by force of seeing the heart of those
<br/>mysteries whose shell only is visible to others, instructs and
<br/>prophesies with an authority felt if not acknowledged. If
<br/>his words inculcate no truth directly, yet, by their innate
<br/>harmony with universal laws, and by the sweet domestic
<br/>privilege with which they enter the heart without knocking,
<br/>they clarify the conscience, and inspire us with an eagerness
<br/>after truth, as would a lender or majestic landscape in out-
<br/>ward nature. Let no man then take up the lyre hastily or
<br/>irreverently, still less let him make its chords answerable
<br/>for a gross and vulgar music.</p>
            <p>In America we have been accustomed to confer the title
<br/>of poet as if it were of no more value or import than a trum-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>pery “ Honorable” or “Excellency.” We have something
<br/>like a thousand individuals in the country to whom the critics
<br/>of the newspapers and magazines concede the name. But
<br/>there are half a dozen who form a kind of inner circle, who
<br/>already, though in the prime of life, enjoy all the advantages
<br/>of a posthumous fame, and whose portraits smile with an
<br/>embarrassed air opposite all the title-pages of selections from
<br/>American poets. It is to these that our critics periodically
<br/>challenge England to produce a parallel. It is these who are
<br/>led out and exhibited when the intelligent foreigner inquires
<br/>after our poets—honest, matter-of-fact-looking men, as the
<br/>poets of a business people ought to be.</p>
            <p>Mr. Halleck has had the ill fortune to be one of these fron-
<br/>tispiecial exemplars. We call it ill fortune, for it is as un-
<br/>happy a thing for a man to receive more as to receive less
<br/>than his deserts. But in speaking of Mr. Halleck we shall
<br/>treat him as if he were a young author now for the first time
<br/>making his appearance before the world. What his reputa-
<br/>tion has been is nothing to us: what it ought to be is the on-
<br/>ly question. To have been always considered and treated as
<br/>one of Fame’s joint-heirs, and then to find that Fame has cut
<br/>one off with a shilling, is worse than to have known the truth
<br/>from the beginning.</p>
            <p>If the volume before us, then, were the work of a young
<br/>author, (and we should remember that in this case the real
<br/>age of Mr. H. renders all faults less inexcusable,) is there
<br/>anything in it that would lead us to prophesy great things of
<br/>his future career? To this question we must frankly and
<br/>readily answer, no. There is none of that exuberance here,
<br/>that seeming waste of energy, which characterises the spring-
<br/>tide of a great poet’s heart, of whose innumerable blossoms
<br/>few will ever become anything more useful than an orna-
<br/>ment and token of immortal plenty. Here is none of that fe-
<br/>licitous sympathy of ear and eye which gives every word and
<br/>image and harmonic invention of his as good a right to be in
<br/>the world, as any blossom or bird or sigh of the wind can
<br/>have. Here is none of that fine reverence which overhangs
<br/>his heart like the broad free sky, now bare, simple, sustain-
<br/>ing, now sprinkled thick with starry hopes and aspirations,
<br/>and always the bestower of dignity, courage, and the calm
<br/>majesty of entire humbleness. Here is none of that enthusi-
<br/>asm for his art which makes success but an argument for
<br/>less self-glory, and which turns a whole unbelieving world’s
<br/>scorn into a stepping-stone to a higher peak of inspiration.</p>
            <p>The world is indebted to the volume before us for no new
<br/>thought, for the opening of no new vista into the enchanted
<br/>forest of imagination, for no new combination of the won-
<br/>drous melody of words. There is none of that inspiration
<br/>here, none of that magnetic sympathy of genius which could
<br/>solve for the young poet the enigma of his soul, and waken
<br/>the slumbering energies of heart and brain and will, till the
<br/>grand images and harmonics of the master fade away, and
<br/>he beholds only the great void future like a silent organ
<br/>waiting but for the appointed touch to breathe divinest mu-
<br/>sic and ravish the reluctant world with love and pity. But
<br/>even in some of the yet coarser elements of a true poet, Mr.
<br/>Halleck is deficient. To the simpler and more vivacious
<br/>kinds of metre, which depend rather on a certain gross and
<br/>physical excitement of the musical sense, his ear is compe-
<br/>tent; but he seems to lack comprehension of these whose
<br/>meaning is more interior, and whose charm is due to remoter
<br/>and less tangible sympathies. What ingenuity, for example,
<br/>could make anything like rhythm of such incorrigible, cordu-
<br/>roy joltings as these:</p>
            <div class="lg">
            <br/>“ Even of Campbell’s pen bath pictured: he.—
<br/>“ To be o’erpraised even by her worshipper—Poesy” ?</div>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page283"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <p>Love has been so reverenced by true poets, and woman so
<br/>worthily praised, that a poet’s treatment of either of these
<br/>hallowed subjects might almost be taken as a test of his pow-
<br/>er. Andromache and she
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Whose face did launch a thousand ships”</div>
            <br/>give bloom and fragrance to the Iliad. Beatrice hangs like
<br/>a quiet star over the sulphureous pit of Dante’s Hell, glides
<br/>with a calming sereneness through his Purgatory, and is the
<br/>heavenliest part of his Paradise. How unequalled are Shaks-
<br/>peare’s pictures of women ! Playful, whimsical, coquettish,
<br/>sarcastic, yet never merely ornamental, and rounded off al-
<br/>ways with tender reverence and a pathos that gives them a
<br/>noble dignity. And who will ever forget (to name no others)
<br/>Wordsworth’s “ Phantom of Delight” and Coleridge’s “ Ge-
<br/>nevieve” ? Mr. Halleck, with all the experience of fifty years
<br/>in his head and heart, is content to put forth the following
<br/>verses as containing his theory of love, but at the same time,
<br/>to prevent any ill effect upon the mind of a susceptible pub-
<br/>lic, he neutralises his nonsense by an equal amount of in-
<br/>comprehensibility. In the first two stanzas the poet’s mind
<br/>takes a horticultural turn, and beholds love in the original
<br/>and novel shape of a tree :
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ When the tree of Love is budding first,
<br/>Ere yet its leaves are green,
<br/>Ere yet, by shower ami sunbeam nursed,
<br/>No infant life has been,
<br/>The wild bee’s slightest touch might wring
<br/>The buds from off the tree”—</div>
            <br/>Love, it will be seen, makes but an indifferent kind of tree
<br/>and puts forth buds of most singular, though convenient fra-
<br/>gility.
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ But when its open leaves have found
<br/>A home in the free air,
<br/>Pluck them—and there remains a wound
<br/>That ever rankles there.”</div>
            <br/>Where ? why?
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ The blight of hope and happiness
<br/>Is felt when fond ones part.
<br/>And the bitter tear that follows is
<br/>The life-blood of the heart.”</div>
            <br/>A statement with regard to arterial circulation that would
<br/>make Hervey open his eyes.—But “ the tree of Love” is cut
<br/>down in the next stanza to make a fire of.
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ When the flame of Love is kindled first,
<br/>’Tis the fire-fly’s light at even—
<br/>•	•	•	•
<br/>A breath can bid it bum no more.”</div>
            <br/>Flatly contradicted by the experience of every unbreeched
<br/>philosopher who has exercised his lungs in endeavoring to
<br/>blow a fire-fly into a flame. Mr. H. seems to think the suc-
<br/>cess of such an experiment possible.
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ But when that flame has blazed into
<br/>A being and a power,
<br/>And smiled in scorn upon the dew
<br/>That fell in its first warm hour.”</div>
            <br/>We were rather puzzled at first to think with what particu-
<br/>lar muscles a “ flame" would “ smile”, but we had neglected
<br/>to observe that it had “ blazed into a being.” Mr. Espy’s
<br/>theory of rain is hinted at in the third verse, we suppose, or
<br/>else what has the dew to do with it ? We should like also
<br/>to know which “hour” of a flame is not “ warm.” We must
<br/>not be surprised to find that a flame which has already been
<br/>a tree and has accomplished the difficult disdain of a “ smile
<br/>in scorn”, should become two things at once in the next
<br/>stanza.
<div class="lg">
               <br/> “ ’Tis the flame that curls round the martyr’s head,”—</div>
            <br/>Our sympathies, then, for Latimer, and Huss, and the rest,
<br/>have been strangely misplaced.<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Whose task is to destroy,
<br/>’Tis the lamps on the altars of the dead,
<br/>Whose light but darkens joy.”</div>
            <br/>The next stanza is wholly incomprehensible:
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Then crush even in their hour of birth,
<br/>The infant buds of love,
<br/>And tread his glowing fire to earth,
<br/>’Ere ’tis dark in clouds above ;
<br/>Cherish no more a cypress tree
<br/>To shade thy future years,
<br/>Nor nurse a heart-flame that may be
<br/>Quenched only with thy tears.”</div>
            <br/>In the next line a girl’s Leghorn hat is said to be
<div class="lg">
               <br/>.... Of the bright gold tint
<br/>The setting sunbeams give to Autumn clouds,
<br/>The riband that encircled it as blue
<br/>As spots of sky upon a moonless night
<br/>When stars are keeping revelry in heaven."</div>
            <br/>We shall expect to hear shortly of Jupiter being put into
<br/>some celestial watch-house, or Mars relating his “experi-
<br/>ence” in a Temperance meeting.</p>            
            <p>The same young woman’s waist, the poet tells us, might
<br/>be “spanned with your thumb and finger”, and
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Her foot was loveliest of remembered things” !
<br/>.......................................
<br/>“ But ’twas that foot that broke the spell—alas !
<br/>Its stocking had a deep, deep tinge of blue—
<br/>I turned away in sadness and passed on.”</div>
            <br/>It is possible that Mr. Halleck may have the hardihood to
<br/>defend this on the ground of its being humorous. And we
<br/>suppose that the next poem is humorous also. If it be, we
<br/>are sincerely glad, for it is surely nothing else. We shall
<br/>not take the trouble to prove that humorous poetry, even
<br/>where the humor is genuine, is the lowest kind of poetry, if,
<br/>indeed, it can be rightly called so at all. In Mr. Halleck’s
<br/>verses the “ humor” comes in very incongruously, and gives
<br/>all our expectations a neck-breaking jolt.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of traditional morality and of entirely
<br/>false sentiment in Mr. H.’s verses. For example, “Aln-
<br/>wick Castle” he says
<div class="lg">
               <br/>“ The Moslem tramples on the Greek,
<br/>And on the Cross and altar stone,
<br/>And Christendom looks tamely on,
<br/>• • • •
<br/>And not a sabre blow is given
<br/>For Greece and fame, for faith and heaven,
<br/>By Europe’s craven chivalry.”</div>
            <br/>When “faith and heaven” require to be defended by “sabre
<br/>blows” and bloodshed, they must have sadly degenerated
<br/>from what they were in Christ’s time.</p>
            <p>In the same poem Mr. H. laments that the day of romance
<br/>has gone by, a statement which he sustains by telling us
<br/>that the Highlanders of Scotland wear pantaloons, and that
<div class="lg"> 
               <br/>“ Lord Stafford mines for coal and salt,
<br/>The Duke of Norfolk deals in malt,
<br/>The Douglas in red herrings”—</div>
            <br/>four facts which all the shopkeepers in New York will con-
<br/>sider extremely ludicrous, as a matter of course, without
<br/>thinking for a moment that all these peers are much more
<br/>creditably employed than any of their ruffian ancestors ever
<br/>were. Moreover, there is more that is truly poetical in the
<br/>operations connected with mining, the raising of malt, and
<br/>the herring fishery, than in all the “ chivalry” that ever went
<br/>about breaking the heads of peaceable neighbours and the
<br/>hearts of their wives and children. The man who thinks
<br/>that the age of romance has gone by to-day, would have
<br/>thought the same in Spenser’s time. Poetry is as rife in the
<br/>world as ever, but the secret of it lies in the heart and eye
<br/>and ear of the poet, not in any combination of circumstances.</p>

<br/>Perote May 16, 1844. By William Preston Snapp. New York: Burgess,
<br/>Stringer &amp; Co.</p>
             <p>This is a book at all points entertaining, and now and then imbued
<br/>with a vivid and terrible interest. We quote some instances of Mex-
<br/>ican vagrancy and audacity:—if these things were not known to be
<br/>fact, we should speak of them as capital romance :</p>
             <p>"Among the numerous wretches who, as professional beggars,
<br/>swarm the streets of this city, or in the filthy guise of blackened lepe-
<br/>ros, haunt the pavé by day, and prowl for plunder at night, are out.
<br/>casts and cut-throats, whom previous convictions have deadened to
<br/>all sense of shame, and habitual vice and indolence trained to every
<br/>deed of violence. In the portals of the churches, beneath the walls
<br/>of the convents, in the markets, or their lairs in the suburbs, they
<br/>crouch to watch tor their unsuspecting prey, and wo to that unarmed
<br/>pedestrian, who, in reply to their Por el amor de Dios, reveals a purse
<br/>to tempt their ferocious cupidity.</p>
              <p>“ Banded in fraternities, that reach from the pulque shops to the
<br/>palace, their organization has been known to reveal itself through ev-
<br/>ery grade of rank, from the roofless footpad to those nearest in author-
<br/>ity to the president. An instance of audacity is authentically related
<br/>to have occurred some years ago, which not unaptly illustrates the
<br/>lawless spirit of these plunderers. The mules of a conducta were
<br/>ranged in two tiles in the square of the Adouana (or custom-house),
<br/>and, surrounded by a strong squadron of cavalry, waited to be
<br/>loaded with the bags of specie, containing fifteen hundred dollars each,
<br/>and piled up in the square to be sent off. A large crowd was as usual
<br/>assembled to look on, when a gang of mounted thieves charged through
<br/>the streets leading to the square, and riding down idlers and troops,
<br/>seized each a bag of the treasure, and bore it off in triumph.</p>
            <p>"The energy of the present government has done much to reduce
<br/>the frequency and insolence of these outrages about the capital, yet
<br/>they continue to prevail in all their won led atrocity elsewhere through
<br/>the republic. Not a league of their only national highway from the
<br/>city to Vera Cruz, but is the scene of some robbery within the year,
<br/>the public coach being repeatedly pillaged within hail of the cities
<br/>that lie on the route.</p>
            <p>"The following notorious instance of a participation in these enor-
<br/>mities by persons of rank, is familiar to all persons of inquiry who
<br/>have recently been in Mexico.</p>
            <p>“ The Swiss consul, (M. Mairet,) a merchant and man of fortune,
<br/>lived in the western suburbs of the city, and was suspected to have a
<br/>considerable sum of money about his house. His dwelling was more
<br/>than ordinarily secure, being built in the strongest manner, with grat-
<br/>ed windows, and several ferocious dogs were kept chained in the court
<br/>and on the terrace.</p>
            <p>“ A man in the habit of a priest, accompanied by two others, appear-
<br/>ed at his gate one day, and announced to the servant, who answered
<br/>their summons, that they desired to purchase some merchandise of
<br/>the consul, in which he was known to deal. Upon being admitted,
<br/>two of them seized the servant, bound him to a pillar, and gagged
<br/>him, whilst the third relocked the gate. All three then passed into
<br/>the house, where they found Mairet alone, and after stabbing and
<br/>gashing him repeatedly, finally compelled him to disclose the place
<br/>where his treasure was secreted. This, to the amount of some
<br/>ten thousand dollars, with various articles of valuable plate, they
<br/>brought off; the consul only surviving his wounds long enough to re-
<br/>late the particulars of the affair, with such descriptions of the assas-
<br/>sins, as it was thought would lead to their apprehension. A noisy
<br/>search and pursuit was kept up by the police, until a miserable crea-
<br/>ture was arrested, tried, and garroted, upon the ground of some dec-
<br/>larations said to have fallen from him whilst grossly intoxicated. No
<br/>money or article of the plunder being found in his possession, nor
<br/>any corroborative circumstance accompanying his insane confession
<br/>the foreigners denounced the execution as a cowardly subterfuge of
<br/>the government to atone for its corruption and remissness by a double
<br/>murder.</p>
            <p>“Some time elapsed, when two daring robberies were again perpe-
<br/>trated in rapid succession upon wealthy monasteries of the city.
<br/>These were entered and pillaged of more than thirty thousand dollars,
<br/>and the church being roused and combined in the pursuit with the civ-
<br/>il authorities, finally traced them home to the door of Colonel Janes,
<br/>an officer of standing, and acting aid-de-camp of Santa Anna. This
<br/>worthy colonel, having access to the passport office, was more than
<br/>suspected of having planned several previous robberies of the public
<br/>coach, availing himself of the information thus acquired to direct his
<br/>accomplices where the booty was such as to indemnify an attack.</p>
            <p>"The trial of himself and his associates for the pillage of the mon-
<br/>nasteries lasted nearly three years, every effort being made during
<br/>this time by Santa Anna and other officials, to screen him from con-
<br/>viction. Their attempts, however, proving abortive, and sentence of
<br/>death being finally awarded against him, it fell to the lot of the dicta-
<br/>tor, who had, in the meanwhile, risen to the presidency, to ratify the
<br/>verdict, and order his execution. This he declined to do upon one
<br/>pretext and another, granting the condemned respite after respite,
<br/>until popular indignation became exasperated to the highest pitch.
<br/>Dreading the fury bis equivocal course had excited in the public mind,
<br/>and alarmed by threats of a revolutionary character, Santa Anna re-
<br/>tired from the city, and left the task of consummating the vengeance of
<br/>the law to General Bravo.</p>
            <p>“ Janes was finally executed, and, before suffering, confessed his nu-
<br/>merous crimes. Amongst these was the murder of Mairet, in which,
<br/>as in all, he plead the connivance of Santa Anna, and other accompli-
<br/>ces. He died, invoking the most direful curses upon their heads, for
<br/>abandoning him and concurring in his death.”</p>

            <p>In justice to Mr. Brantz Mayer, the author of “ Mexico as it Was

              <p>Remarks on an Address delivered before the New England Society of the City of
<br/>New York, December 23, 1844, by George P. Marsh. Boston: C. Stimp-
<br/>son.</p>
              <p>The manner of writing and punctuating the title-page of this pamph-
<br/>let, is every thing. The remarks are certainly not by George P. Marsh.
<br/>They are by some person anonymous, and are levelled against Mr. M
<br/>—a point which it is just as well to understand. The treatise is pun-
<br/>gently written, but we disagree with it throughout in its estimate of
<br/>Mr. Marsh’s eloquence. The floridity which is objectionable in a
<br/>written book, is not unfrequently a merit in an oration. In this case
<br/>we can easily conceive not only that Mr. Marsh’s oratory was enthu-
<br/>siastically received, but that it was skilfully planned for the purpose
<br/>of ensuring an enthusiastic reception.</p>

            <div class="head">Table-Talk</div>
            <p>  Table-Talk. By William Hazlitt. Part 1. No. 6 of Wiley and Putnam’s Li-
<br/>brary of Choice Reading, pp. 200. Price 37 1-2 cts.</p>
            <p>This is a reprint of the two volumes published in Paris by Galignani,
<br/>under the author’s own supervision, the essays having been selected
<br/>from the four volumes published by himself in London. The second
<br/>part will comprise the essays which the author would probably have
<br/>included in another series which he intended to publish in Paris. It
<br/>would be hardly a remove from sheer impertinence to recommend the
<br/>essays of Hazlitt to ordinary readers ; he has been more universally
<br/>read in this country than any other English essayist, if we except Ma-
<br/>caulay. His egotism, though as obtrusive as Cobbett’s, is one of the
<br/>charms of his style, for it is only the egotism of a dunce that is often
<br/>sive. The two first essays in this volume, on the pleasure of painting,
<br/>we would recommend to the consideration of all young artists who
<br/>have not been abroad. The author had made very satisfactory pro-
<br/>gress in the art when he went to the Louvre while it contained the
<br/>fruits of Napoleon’s conquests in Italy, and he abandoned his easel.
<br/>He saw a variety of excellence that he felt himself unable ever to
<br/>equal, and he gave up painting in despair. Yet he had, unquestiona-
<br/>bly, the genius of a painter, and his writings on art are among the
<br/>most valuable of his productions. His principles may be safely trust-
<br/>ed, but his criticisms on pictures must be taken with many grains of
<br/>allowance for his enthusiasm. He could see charms in a picture which
<br/>no one else could discover, and as bis criticisms were generally based
<br/>upon recollections, he sometimes attributed qualities and features to a
<br/>work which on inspection it was found to lack. The essay in this col-
<br/>lection on a picture by Nicolas Poussin would lead a novice to expect
<br/>qualities in a landscape which no work of art can ever possess. The
<br/>critic attributes to the work itself the sublime ideas which it suggested
<br/>to his mind, but which the painter himself probably never knew
<br/>But the essay in the collection from which most practical good may-
<br/>be gained is that on the ignorance of the learned. It is just the thing
<br/>to take the starch out of a pedant and a book-worm, and we would
<br/>recommend it to the sensible ignorant for their consolation.</p>

<br/>Author of an introduction to history, &amp;c. With portraits and a map.
<br/>London and New York. Wiley and Putnam.</p>
              <p>A handsome volume of nearly three hundred pages, containing a large
<br/>amount of statistics, well calculated to enlighten English readers in
<br/>respect to this country. We cannot understand the motive of the
<br/>author in affixing to a work of this kind such a ponderous joke
<br/>as the absurd review of British poets which appeared in the
<br/>North American Review a year ago. It cannot surely help the sale
<br/>of the book in London, and it will hardly have the effect of soothing
<br/>any of the harsh feelings which may be still entertained by English
<br/>writers towards American authors, or the American people at large.
<br/>It is attaching too much importance to the paltry jealousy or ill na-
<br/>ture of an anonymous scribbler to make his niaseries the subject of na-
<br/>tional recriminations. The portraits are chiefly valuable as being im-
<br/>pressions from plates produced by the nearly discovered process of
<br/>multiplying prints.</p>

              <p>Count Ludwig is one of the most remarkable of its author’s produc-

            <p>The Aristidean.—The April, or second number of the Aristidean,
<br/>is a decided improvement on the first. Some of the papers are exceed-
<br/>ingly good—precisely what Magazine papers should be—vigorous,
<br/>terse, and independent. “ Travels in Texas” is very interesting.
<br/>"Richard Parker’s Widow” is also admirable; and "Hans Spiegen”
<br/>is quite in the Blackwood vein. There is a long review or rather run-
<br/>ning commentary upon Longfellow’s poems. It is, perhaps, a little
<br/>coarse, but we are not disposed to call it unjust; although there are
<br/>in it some opinions which, by implication, are attributed to ourselves
<br/>individually, and with which we cannot altogether coincide. "Shood
<br/>Swing is queer, and the "Notes about Men of Note” are amusing. Of
<br/>the political papers we shall not speak. There is not much verse in
<br/>the number, but some of it is admirable. "The Necessity of Stran-
<br/>gling” is worthy of Hood, and "The Hanging of Polly Bodine” is
<br/>perhaps a better thing in the same way. To show how high an opi-
<br/>nion we entertain of the lines with the wretched title of "A Heart-
<br/>Burst,” we will take the liberty of purloining them in full. They are,
<br/>we think, the composition of the editor, Mr. English, and it is many a
<br/>long day since we have seen anything so truly beautiful—in its pecu-
<br/>liar mode of beauty:</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>Fill me no cup of Xeres' wine to her my heart holds dear;
<br/>If you insist to pledge with me, then drop a silent tear.
<br/>For she I love is far away, and months must pass before
<br/>Her heart shall leap to hear again my foot-tramp at the door.
<br/>And thus apart, my weary heart, torn both with hopes and fears,
<br/>Gives to my spirit wretchedness, and to my eyelids tears.
<br/>You laugh and quaff your Xeres’ wine around the festive board,
<br/>And jest with names of those you love, which secret you should hoard;
<br/>And I conceal how much I feel, for words could not express
<br/>The sorrow weeping in my heart, the abject wretchedness,
<br/>Illumined by a single hope—God grant it not in vain!—
<br/>That foes may cease to part our hearts, and we may meet again.</div>
           <p>In mechanical execution—that is to say, in its general external and
<br/>internal arrangement, the “ Aristidean” is infinitely before any Ame-
<br/>rican magazine:—although the cover, perhaps, might be improved.
<br/>In regard to its morale, the rock on which it seems most in danger of
<br/>splitting is coarseness of vituperation. But if we are to choose be-
<br/>tween this and namby-pambyism, give us by all means not the latter.
<br/>We sincerely wish the editor all the success which his vigorous abili-
<br/>ties deserve.</p>

             <div>
               <div class="head">Melodies, by J.T.S. Sullivan</div>
               <p> Melodies, by J. T. S. Sullivan, adapted to Airs, selected from the German
<br/>Italian and French Composers. Published by George W. Appleton, 148
<br/>Chesnut street, Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Such is the title of a typed, or rather stereotyped work of some
<br/>pretension. How it will support this pretension we shall see anon.
<br/>We have heard of poems of every description being adapted to melo-
<br/>dies, but we must candidly confess that we never before heard of Me-
<br/>lodies being adapted to Airs. Byron and Moore wrote words to He-
<br/>brew and Irish Melodies, and the joint production (words and music)
<br/>was known as the Hebrew Melodies or the Irish Melodies. We think
<br/>that it would be advisable to alter the title to one more comprehen-
<br/>sive.</p>
               <p>The composers from whose works the airs are selected, are F.
<br/>Schubert, Bellini, F. Wollank, and G. Doering, besides two airs, com-
<br/>posers’ names not known. We think the selection very poor; they are,
<br/>in fact, the veriest musical trifles that have come under our notice for
<br/>a considerable period. From such an inexhaustible stock of good ma-
<br/>terials, it is really a matter for wonder, that six such unimportant
<br/>melodies or airs should have been chosen. It must have cost conside-
<br/>rable trouble to pick them out. The music of Germany and France is
<br/>particularly rich in songs, romances, and chorusses, and the amount
<br/>of the beautiful in them is truly great. It would be a valuable gift to
<br/>the musical world, if an extensive and judicious selection were made
<br/>from these gems, and we believe Mr. Sullivan to be eminently calcu-
<br/>lated to adapt the poetry to them. We can find nothing to condemn
<br/>in the present poetical portion of the work before us. It is carefully
<br/>executed, the accentuation is well preserved, and the sentiments just-
<br/>ly conceived. We are pleased to be able to compliment Mr. Sullivan
<br/>upon his taste.</p>

               <div class="head">Where Art Thou</div>
                <p>Where Art Thou, words by Mrs. Norton, are by no means adapted to
<br/>the air Oft in the Stilly Night, there being one or two feet more in every
<br/>line of her poem than there are in Moore’s. To adapt them, therefore,
<br/>would require additional notes, to commence on the third beat, instead
<br/>of the first of the bar, which would materially alter the character of
<br/>the music. Why this poem is placed in this collection, (unless to fill
<br/>up a space) especially as the music is not given, we are at a loss to
<br/>understand. We like the idea of the work much, and it is probable
<br/>that the selections may improve. We wish the undertaking every
<br/>success, and hope to be able to give a more flattering account of the
<br/>next number.</p>

               <div class="head">Clydesdale Farewell</div>
               <p>Clydesdale Farewell, a Scottish ballad, written and composed by
<br/>James Lawson. This ballad is written and composed by an amateur.
<br/>Music owes a considerable debt of gratitude to musical amateurs, for
<br/>the interest they take in the art, and for the many admirable contri-
<br/>butions they have given to the world. The names of Lord Onslow,
<br/>the Earl of Mornington, Beale, Rogers, and very many others, will be
<br/>remembered by musicians with pleasure. We have, to be sure, very
<br/>frequently to be lenient to the effect, for the sake of the cause.</p>
              <p>The ballad before us is simple and pretty. The composer has aim-
<br/>ed at an imitation of the Scottish character, and if the imitation be
<br/>not very close, it is at least near enough to fix the idea. The arrange-
<br/>ment is very easy, and the vocal part ranges within the compass of
<br/>very little more than an octave. It will doubtless find many admirers
<br/>and numerous purchasers.</p>

               <p>BERTINI'S PIANO FORTE METHOD. Published by W. H. Okes, and for sale by
<br/>E. H. Wade, 197 Washington st. Boston.</p>
               <p>Our remarks upon this celebrated Instruction Book, have called forth
<br/>many enquiries from various quarters, and as it is impossible for us to
<br/>answer them individually, we take this opportunity to answer them
<br/>en masse.</p>
               <p>What we have before said upon the excellences of this work, we find
<br/>fully confirmed upon closer examination, and we have the testimony
<br/>of many eminent men to the fact of its admirable adaptation to the use
<br/>of students, and of its inevitable effect in producing brilliant and cer-
<br/>tain players, undeviating timeists, and in imparting a thorough theo-
<br/>retical knowledge of the necessary principles of music, and a sterling
<br/>and classical method of performance.</p>
               <p>We ourselves, have daily evidence of the benefit conferred upon pu-
<br/>pils by the adoption of Bertini’s method; not alone in the mechanical
<br/>but in the mental portion of the art, which is, after all, of the highest
<br/>importance to the beginner, for unless the mind perceives and compre-
<br/>hends what the hands have to execute, the progress must be slow and
<br/>unsatisfactory in the extreme. The most intelligent master, without
<br/>the assistance of some such work as this, and there is no work ex-
<br/>tant so perfect, must find an almost unconquerable difficulty in making
<br/>clear to the perception of the pupil the minute divisions of time, and<div class="pagebreak" id="#page286"/>
                  <br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
other particulars, which, though trifling in themselves, yet serve to
make up an amount of mystery, to a youthful mind, hard to unravel.</p>
               <p>Of course these mysteries have been unravelled; each master hav-
<br/>ing some particular plan or method to elucidate the system. But how
<br/>much labor may be saved the master ; how much mental puzzling and
<br/>memory-staving may be spared the pupil, when a work is used which
<br/>will lighten the toil of both. We have had many years’ experience in
<br/>the instruction of young people, and have groaned in spirit for our-
<br/>selves, and have mourned no less for those, who, lacking in quick ap-
<br/>preciation, have toiled and struggled on through what must have ap-
<br/>peared to them an endless sea of difficulty, and can, therefore, fully
<br/>appreciate to the fullest extent all the advantages offered by the
<br/>Method of Bertini.</p>
               <p>We promised in our notice of this work, to advise our young friends
<br/>upon certain important and admirable portions of the Method for parti-
<br/>cular practice. We are unable to do so in this notice, from want of
<br/>space. But we will do so, by and bye, as we do not think that too
<br/>much attention can be drawn to an elementary work of such undoubt-
<br/>ed merit.</p>
               <p>To those of our professional friends who have not already examined
<br/>it, we earnestly recommend an early and faithful perusal of the work,
<br/>for we feel convinced, that its general use will do more to correct the
<br/>imperfect and superficial system of musical education now but too
<br/>prevailing, than all that can be written or urged by the united power
<br/>of the press.</p>

                <p>Park Theatre.—Mr. Anderson has just closed an engagement at
<br/>this establishment, which has proved beyond a doubt, the most profi-
<br/>table and the most honorable, both to the manager and the actor, to
<br/>be found on record for many years. Mr. Anderson has won for himself
<br/>the universal praise of the press, and he is the acknowledged and
<br/>prime favorite of the public. He has won his laurels justly, and may
<br/>he wear them long.</p>

               <p>Olympic Theatre.—This popular place of amusement, finished on
<br/>Wednesday last, a season of the most unparalleled success. Mr. Mitch-
<br/>ell is undoubtedly the wisest and the most far-seeing of managers.
<br/>His success cannot be attributed to individual excellence, but rather to
<br/>the perfect ensemble. He deals not with stars, but he gathers around
<br/>him a first-rate working team which he fashions to his hand, adapting
<br/>them to the wants and the tastes of the public. Every novelty abroad
<br/>—adapted to his company and his audience, finds its way to his thea-
<br/>tre in advance of all competitors. He is indefatigable in catering to
<br/>the amusement of the public, and hence his unwavering success.
<br/>Mr. Mitchell departs upon a professional tour next week. He will
<br/>visit Boston first we believe.</p>

                <p>Although we have approved the recommendation of the Commit-
<br/>tee of the Historical Society, in regard to changing the national name,
<br/>yet we must acknowledge that we have had but little faith that the
<br/>people would be influenced by the recommendation. Names of coun-
<br/>tries must be of spontaneous generation, but when one is given by
<br/>law it may be as well not to disturb it. As our nation extends its
<br/>boundaries, the States must grow more provincial, and from necessity
<br/>the people will be called after their provinces rather than the conti-
<br/>nent which they inhabit. We shall learn to call each other, and shall
<br/>be distinguished abroad as Vermonters, Virginians or Texans. But
<br/>there is a difficulty in the awkward names of some of the Slates—as
<br/>Massachusetts, Ohio, New Hampshire, &amp;c. Necessity, however, who
<br/>is always ready with an invention, when one is needed, will never fail
<br/>to supply a nick-name without the help of any other society than so-
<br/>ciety at large. The following list of national nick-names, which we

               <div class="head">Popular Lectures</div>
              <p>Popular Lectures.—We looked into some forty or fifty exchange
<br/>papers one day last week, and found in every one of them, from city
<br/>and country, Mrs. Caudle’s lectures from Punch. This led us first to
<br/>read them and then to reflect on the cause of their popularity. They
<br/>are evidently a hit. Yet they possess no particular interest, no story,
<br/>no plot, no wit, no puns, nothing thrilling or exciting, but only a few
<br/>little touches of nature which have found admission into every heart
<br/>at which they have knocked. We will venture to assert that no lady
<br/>will see anything to admire or laugh at in Mrs. Caudle’s lectures.
<br/>But they are immensely popular among husbands, who have all heard
<br/>something like them, and out of pure spile to their Mrs. Caudles, all
<br/>who have newspapers under their control, publish the lectures to let
<br/>the world into secrets that they dare not directly divulge. Laman
<br/>Blanchard has been named as the author of these popular lectures,
<br/>but that is an error : they are by another hand. Let him be who he
<br/>may, he relates his own experiences; there is more truth in Mrs. Cau-
<br/>dle’s curtain lectures than in any course of scientific lectures that we
<br/>are acquainted with. Dr. Lardner’s were not half so popular because
<br/>they were not half so true.</p>

<br/>SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES,
<br/>No. 255 Greene Street,
<br/>One door above Waverly Place, New York.
<br/>THIS School differs essentially from most others in
<br/>this city, in one particular: the number admitted is so limited that each
<br/>scholar receives the personal attention and instruction of the principals.
<br/>Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of
<br/>qualifying himself as an instructor.
<br/>The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France;
<br/>and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
<br/>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course in-
<br/>cludes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic,
<br/>with Composition. Reading aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the
<br/>daily exercises of the whole school.
<br/>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of An-
<br/>cient and Modern History and the French Language.
<br/>In the higher or Ӕsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-
<br/>glish course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and
<br/>Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
<br/>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-
<br/>position, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from
<br/>Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures
<br/>on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and
<br/>the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious
<br/>illustrations from French and English Literature.

            <div class="ab">BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
<br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
<br/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<br/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<br/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<br/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<br/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils, will be en
<br/>abled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musi
<br/>cians.
<br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rud-
<br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time and each lesson
<br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.	
<br/>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<br/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of BERTINI's METHOD
<br/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<br/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<br/>names in the principal cities.

            <div class="ab">REPUBLICATION	OF THE FOREIGN MAGAZINES.
<br/>LONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WEST-
<br/>MINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD’S MAGA-
<br/>ZINE.
<br/>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
<br/>arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on line white paper
<br/>and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
<br/>act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.
<br/>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
<br/>say much to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of
<br/>any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
<br/>is marked by a dignity, candor, ana forbearance not often found in works of
<br/>a party character.
<br/>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
<br/>and Radical. “ Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly” are Tory ; the
<br/>“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the “ Westminster” Radical. The “ For-
<br/>eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
<br/>foreign Continental Works.
<br/>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign
<br/>copies ; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advan-
<br/>tage to the American over the English reader.
<br/>TERMS.—Payment to be made in Advance.
<br/>For the four Quarterly Reviews, $8.00 per annum,
<br/>For any three	"	"	7.00	"

<br/>Washington, D. C., May, 1844.
<br/>THE neglect of the Teeth is the cause of much suffering
<br/>and regret, and should not be disregarded by the most thoughtless.

<br/>professional skill, and believing him well qualified in the science of
<br/>Dental Surgery, and an accomplished and skillful operator, we most
<br/>cheerfully certify to the ease and safety with which Dr. B. performs
<br/>the various and important operations, so essential to the usefulness,
<br/>durability, and beauty of the Teeth.
