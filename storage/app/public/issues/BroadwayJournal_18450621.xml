         <div class="head">THE ADVENTURES OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH OF A DINNER.</div>
         <div class="ab">RELATED BY HIMSELF.</div>
               <p>In the year eighteen hundred and something, I forget the
<br/>figures, but it was the year of the cholera in New York, I be-
<br/>came acquainted in Paris with a gentleman of my own years
<br/>named Julius Bartol. Our first meeting was at a ball at the
<br/>American Ambassador’s, and our last at the Rocher, where we
<br/>had such a dinner as the Rocher alone could produce. Bartol
<br/>was a New Yorker by birth, and he gloried in being called a
<br/>Knickerbocker, but his tastes, his predilections, his habits and
<br/>his education were thoroughly French. He had been sent to
<br/>Paris at an early age to be placed in a commercial Academy,
<br/>for his father was a merchant and meant that his son should
<br/>be one; but before his education was completed, old Bartol
<br/>died and left him a very large estate. He abandoned the idea
<br/>of business, and after spending a few years in Paris returned
<br/>to New York, and married a lady with an estate equal to his
<br/>own. His position in society, from his great wealth, being in-
<br/>finitely above my own, I had purposely avoided him after his
<br/>return home, but one day as I was crossing the Park, after
<br/>having suffered martyrdom in a cross-examination by two im-
<br/>pertinent lawyers in the City Hall, I met him and he express-
<br/>ed so much unaffected good will towards me, that I accepted
<br/>an invitation to dine with him the next day.</p>
                <p>“ You remember our dinner at the Rocher ?” said Bartol.</p>
         <p>“ Remember it,” I replied, “as the Hoosier said, I remem-
<br/>ber nothing else.”</p>
               <p>“ Very good,” said Bartol, “ I am glad to hear it, I will give
<br/>you a better one to-morrow ; our cook is a second Vatel; but
<br/>that is nothing; my wife will dine with us, and you shall know
<br/>what it is to sit down with an angel. But come early and romp
<br/>with my little girls before dinner; there will be but two or
<br/>three friends besides."</p>
                <p>I am no glutton, I am not even a bon vivant, but I have a
<br/>passion for good dinners, and although I have a tolerably en-
<br/>thusiastic feeling for works of what are called fine art, I am
<br/>not ashamed to own that no tableau ever charmed me like a
<br/>well appointed table. The extent of the benefit to be derived
<br/>from a picture is a momentary sensation of pleasure, but the
<br/>benefits of a good table are health, life, cheerfulness, content,
<br/>pleasant dreams and a lively fancy. There can be no doubt
<br/>that infinite harm has been done in our day by the wickedness
<br/>of business and learned men, in affecting an indifference to
<br/>the table. All stoicism is false and injurious, but the stoicism
<br/>of the dinner table is the most false and injurious of all. We
<br/>make the most lavish and ostentatious provisions for the nurture
<br/>of the mind, but leave the body to the mercies of the most ig-
<br/>norant and degraded parties of our household; and, as if we
<br/>were afraid of enjoying good health, we heap every term of
<br/>contempt upon the servant in whose integrity and skill the
<br/>health of body and mind depend, namely, the cook. Perhaps
<br/>much of the indifference shown towards the table, is owing to
<br/>the frequency of our meals, which allowing us no time to gain
<br/>an appetite, renders eating rather a nauseous duty, than a keen<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>delight. It is surprising that among our classicists, no one has
<br/>ever thought of imitating the Romans in regard to their meals.
<br/>They, as is well known, ate but once a day, and then they
<br/>came to their dinners with good appetites and a lively sense of
<br/>the importance of the duty of eating. Dispepsia was unknown
<br/> among them, and any schoolboy will talk to you of Roman
<br/> firmness, of Roman courage, of Roman patriotism and a thous-
<br/>and other virtues, which I fear will never be honored by an
<br/>American prefix. And then what arms and legs, and necks
<br/> and shoulders, do sculptors and painters give to Roman
<br/>soldiers and even Roman poets. To sum up the whole matter
<br/> in two words, the Romans dined but once a day and conquered
<br/> the world. Gen. Jackson has sometimes been called an old
<br/>Roman, and one of his admirers has lately sent him the sarco-
<br/> phagus of Alexander Severus for his coffin ; but there is as
<br/>much difference between the shrunk shanks of the modern and
<br/>the thews and sinews of the old Roman, as there is between
<br/>the wooden coffins of the modem and the marbles ones of the
<br/>ancients. We must go back to the one meal system before
<br/> stone coffins will seem applicable for our slender carcasses. It
<br/>is the pernicious system of eating four times a day that has
<br/>led to the invention of all the salmis and potages, which cause
<br/>gout, dyspepsia and dropsy, by tempting us to eat when we
<br/> have no inclination for the table ; but eating once a day would
<br/> not only lead us to attach more importance to the ethics of the
<br/>table, but would save us from the frightful amount of charla-
<br/>tanry and empiricism, that are practiced in our kitchens, as
<br/>well as in our universities and legislatures.</p>
                <p>Do I practice what I preach ? Of course I do, and I am
<br/>never troubled with a disinclination for my dinner. On the
<br/> contrary, I am sure of one great pleasure every day of my
<br/> life, let what will happen, for I can hardly conceive of any
<br/>trouble of sufficient magnitude to make a man in good health,
<br/>who eats but once a day, forget his dinner. There was one
<br/> thing to dampen in a degree the pleasure which I anticipated
<br/> in dining with my friend Bartol. His dinner hour was three
<br/> o’clock, while my own is invariably five. Therefore my ap-
<br/>petite would lack two hours sharpness ; but I obviated this
<br/>difficulty by eating a lighter dinner the day before. I omitted
<br/>exactly one fresh roll and a meringue, which balanced very
<br/> nearly the two hours, for when one o’clock came I felt about
<br/> the same degree of hunger that I usually do at three.</p>
                <p>Let me satisfy my friend, the reader, in the outset of my
<br/>adventures, that I had no mercenary motive in accepting the in-
<br/> vitation of Bartol, for I was compelled to buy a white vest, a
<br/> pair of kid gloves, a linen pocket handkerchief, and a pair of
<br/> Mack French cassimere pantaloons, the cest of which would
<br/> have paid for a good many dinners. The truth is, that I very
<br/> seldom go to a dinner-party, because I have found by experi-
<br/>ence that a good dinner is very uncertain, and, therefore, I
<br/>had not on hand the necessary apparel to appear in on such an
<br/> occasion. But I had no fear of Bartol; I knew that his dinner
<br/>would justify me in the expense of an entire suit, although it
<br/>so happened that my funds were extremely low, and I had neg-
<br/>lected to cultivate a credit at any of the tailoring establish-
<br/> ments. After I had paid for my new clothes I had just a half<div class="pagebreak" id="#page386"/>

            <div class="columnbreak"/>
         </p>
         <p>eagle and two shilling pieces in my pocket, and I had no ex-
<br/>pectation of getting more until next dividend day, a month off,
<br/>unless the publisher of a certain Review should keep his
<br/>promise and pay me for my essay on “ Dinners in the time of
<br/>the Revolution,” an event which I had no right to hope for,
<br/>having nothing better than an editor’s word to depend upon.</p>
                <p>As Bartol lived in the most fashionable extremity of the city
<br/>I was forced to take a cab, for the streets were dusty as usual,
<br/>when they are not muddy, and the cab hire was but a trifle
<br/>compared with the injury which my clothes would receive from
<br/>the dust. The cabman was a saucy fellow and demanded three
<br/>shillings, but I had induced him to take me for two, for I was
<br/>loth to break in upon my half eagle. The fellow drove off
<br/>pretty briskly until he had got entirely clear of the cab stand,
<br/>and then he slacked up and let his horse walk.</p>
                <p>“ Come, Sir,” I said, “ this will never do; drive faster.”</p>
                <p>“ Are you in a hurry ?" said the cabman.</p>
                <p>“ Certainly, I am,” I replied.</p>
                <p>“Well, I am not,” said the cabman; “ I agreed to take you
<br/>for two shillings, but I shall take my own time for it; unless
<br/>you give me another shilling.”</p>
                <p>“I will not give you another penny, you blackguard,” I re-
<br/>plied.</p>
                <p>“Very well,” said he, “here goes then, slow and easy. I
<br/>like it and so does my hoss, Bossy. Take your time, Mister.”</p>
                <p>I felt for my watch, and missing it, remembered that I had
<br/>left it at the watch-maker’s to be cleaned. There was time
<br/>enough, however, even at the slow pace at which I was going,
<br/>to reach Bartol’s by three, provided that we made no stops,
<br/>and I should only miss romping with the children, which I
<br/>rather preferred doing. Drag; drag; drag; I grew impatient
<br/>every moment; I caught a glance at a clock in a soda shop,
<br/>and it lacked ten minutes of three. “ Do have the goodness,
<br/>my friend,” I said in a subdued voice, “ to drive a little faster.
<br/>I must get to Marmion-place by three.”</p>
                <p>“ What did you observe ?” said the driver.</p>
                <p>“ I observed that you must drive faster, or I shall be too
<br/>late for dinner.”</p>
                <p>“ Whoa ! Whoa,” said the cabman, checking his horse and
<br/>coming to a dead halt. “ What did you observe, Sir; there is
<br/>such a noise that I couldn’t hear.”</p>
                <p>“ You’ll repent of this, you scamp,” said I, “ go a-head.”</p>
                <p>“What makes you think so, Sir,” he said, looking me in the
<br/>face ; “perhaps you’ll repent of not paying me my full fare.”</p>
                <p>I saw there was no use in parleying with the scoundrel, so I
<br/>swallowed the hard words that were rising in my throat and
<br/>made him no reply. He whistled, “ Take your time, Miss Lucy,”
<br/>and put his horse in motion again, but he came to a halt at the
<br/>corner of fourth street, to let a couple of omnibusses go past
<br/>that had started on a race from Union Square. I knew it must
<br/>be three, and I fancied that the soup was put upon the table.
<br/>I was fast losing all command of myself, but I was determined
<br/>not to be bullied out of a shilling; the French roll and the
<br/>meringue were too much for two hours, and my appetite was
<br/>sharper than usual at five. When a man eats but once in
<br/>twenty-four hours, it is very essential that his dinner should not
<br/>be delayed. “ I tell you how it is, Sir,” I said to the cabman in
<br/>a sharper tone, “ if you do not drive me to Marmion-place in
<br/>less than five minutes, I will make an example of you, you
<br/>villain.”</p>
                <p>“ Who do you call a villain, Mister ?” said the enraged cab-
<br/>man jumping from his box. “ I am no villain. I am an honest
<br/>man. I work for my living; my name is Bunkum. I don’t
<br/>take that from nobody.”</p>
                <p>On any other occasion I would not have cared a copper for
<br/>the fellow. I could have flogged him with ease. But now I<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>could do nothing but run, the passers-by began to gather on
<br/>the side-walk, and to escape a row I opened the cab door, and
<br/>jumping out began to walk very briskly towards Marmion-
<br/>place, which was but a short distance off. The cabman jump-
<br/>ed upon his box again and followed me, crying out, “ pay me
<br/>my fare, will you, pay me my fare.” At first I said I would
<br/>not pay him, but not caring to be followed by the rogue to
<br/>Bartol’s door, I put my hand in my pocket and reached him
<br/>the two shillings. It was five minutes past three by St. Bar-
<br/>tholomew’s clock, but I hurried on and at the corner of Eighth
<br/>street, encountered a spiral cloud of dust and anthracite ashes,
<br/>which nearly blinded me, and made my shirt bosom look like
<br/>a soot bag. I could have cried for vexation if I had not been
<br/>so hungry; but I shook myself and hurried on, and reached
<br/>Marmion-place precisely ten minutes past three. I shall cer-
<br/>tainly miss the soup, I said to myself, as I glanced up at a
<br/>bronze door with the name of Bartol emblazoned on a silver
<br/>plate. If I had known nothing of the owner, I should have
<br/>said at a glance, “ here lives a giver of good dinners.” The
<br/>house was one of the best specimens of a city residence that I
<br/>had ever seen. It had a bit of green sward on one side with
<br/>a small tree in the centre, the expense of which, was probably
<br/>greater than an ordinary farm of three or four hundred acres;
<br/>for in a city land rises in cost as it falls in real value. The
<br/>house was exactly such a one as I should have expected a man
<br/>of Bartol’s refinement to build; large and imposing, but with-
<br/>out anything that looked like ostentation or a love of show. I
<br/>was so well satisfied with the exterior, that, bating my appe-
<br/>tite, I was impatient to see its interior, and above all, the table.
<br/>The front blinds were closed, which looked strange, as there
<br/>was an umbrage screened by a woodbine and trellis-work. I
<br/>pulled the bell. The door was instantly opened by a black
<br/>servant, who put up his hand as I stepped upon the door-sill,
<br/>and said:</p>
                <p>“ Don’t come in, Sir, if you please, their’s a contiguous
<br/>disorder in the house.”</p>
                <p>“A what!” I exclaimed.</p>
                <p>“ A contiguous disease, Sir. Miss Agnes has been took
<br/>very ill with the scarlet fever—”</p>
                <p>“ Perhaps I have mistaken the house ; is this Mr. Charles
<br/>Bartol’s ?”</p>
                <p>“ Ah ! F,” said Bartol, who came running through the hall.
<br/>“ My darling little Agnes has broken out with the scarlet fever
<br/>and we are in a terrible fright. Don’t come in, I am told that
<br/>it is dangerous to visit when the disease is in a house. Dear
<br/>little girl! I have not left her bedside a moment since she
<br/>was taken, for my wife is quite distracted. God help us, but
<br/>I fear the poor child will not survive. I am every moment
<br/>expecting a consultation of physicians.” A very faint cough
<br/>was heard and Bartol darted away without saying another
<br/>word, and the servant closed the door in my face. A few mo-
<br/>ments before the bronze door looked like the gates of Paradise,
<br/>it now looked as gloomy as Dante’s gates in the Inferno. What
<br/>was to be done. I tried to think of some friend living in the
<br/>neighborhood whom I could drop in upon at a family dinner;
<br/>but I couldn't think of a soul. It was a good mile from any
<br/>respectable restaurant, and I had neglected to order dinner as
<br/>usual at my lodgings. I had never in my life been so sharp
<br/>set before. The vision of Bartol’s dinner which had haunted
<br/>my imagination for the past twenty-four hours had caused a
<br/>flood of gastric juice that called for dinner in accents not to
<br/>be misunderstood.</p>
                <p>The holy Saint Wulstan confessed that thoughts of dinner
<br/>had sometimes intruded themselves upon his devotions; and
<br/>another good .English saint, according to Dr. Southey used
<br/>often to exclaim—</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page387"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
                <div class="lg">
            <br/>“ O belly, belly
                <br/>You would be gormandizing now I know,
                <br/>But it shall not be so
                <br/>Home to your bread and water, home,
                <br/>I tell ye.”</div>
                <p>How then could I, who am no saint but a poor sinner, keep
<br/>my mind free from such thoughts in an extremity like this ? I
<br/>I turned my back upon the uppish people and with my face
<br/>towards down-town began to debate in my mind whether it
<br/>would be better to dine at Delmonico’s, or Blancard’s. I settled
<br/>upon the latter, because it was the nearest, and not from any
<br/>preference to its gloomy facade, which looks more like a prison
<br/>than a salle a manger Granite is a very unsuitable material
<br/>for an eating-house, unless it were one where Norfolk dump-
<br/>lings or some such solids are served up. The white marble
<br/>Corinthian columns at the entrance of Delmonico’s triangular
<br/>cafe give a very cheerful and inviting aspect to the house, and,
<br/>I have no doubt are great promoters of digestion.</p>
                <p>As I passed by the New York hotel, and heard the tanta-
<br/>lizing clatter of knives and plates in the dining-room, I recol-
<br/>lected that my friend H. had recently taken up his quarters
<br/>there, and driven by hunger, I walked into the office of the
<br/>hotel, and inquired for him, trusting that he might invite me to
<br/>dine with him. He came to me in a moment with a napkin in
<br/>his hand, and begged me to wait one minute until he had
<br/>finished his soup. But he said not a word about my dining
<br/>with him. In a minute or two, which seemed like an hour to
<br/>me, he reappeared, saying that he was deuced glad to see me
<br/>for he was going out of town that afternoon, and had only time
<br/>to eat a plate of soup for his dinner, and would be eternally
<br/>obliged to me if I would call upon his partner in the morning
<br/>and say that he had left his bank-book at the Merchant’s Bank.
<br/>I am afraid that I did not treat him with much courtesy, for he
<br/>has never spoken to me since. But politeness in my condition
<br/>was out of the question. I came out of the hotel and walked
<br/>very rapidly towards Blancard’s with my eyes averted from 
<br/>oyster cellars, and baker’s shops, lest I should be tempted into 
<br/>them and so lose a regular dinner. Arrived at the Globe I
<br/>entered its heavy looking portal and hurried through the
<br/>marble hall into the dining room. What a delightful sight! what 
<br/>an altogether charming and cheering place it is ! A perfect
<br/>gem of a restaurant. There was but one unoccupied table
<br/>which I took possession of, and casting my eye over the potages
<br/>on the Carte du jour, began to feel the most delightful of all titi- 
<br/>lations. I knew the soups perfectly well by name and I knew
<br/>also that the julien was particularly good. So I ordered that
<br/>but first a dozen of Shrewsbury oysters in the shell, with a
<br/>lemon, then a filet de boeuf au champignons and a meringue 
<br/>and coffee; wine I never drink when I can get Croton water.
<br/>This was a very moderate dinner to be sure, but I have already
<br/>said that I am no glutton; the fresh rolls and the butter are
<br/>particularly fine at the Globe, and the appointments of the
<br/>table are so perfect that even so moderate a dinner may be
<br/>eaten with entire satisfaction. I might have eaten a trifle 
<br/>more, a croquet or a plate of maccaroni ; but I began mode-
<br/>rately. The composure with which I spread my napkin and
<br/>cut my loaf was really marvellous. The waiter had been
<br/>gone just three minutes for the oysters, when a person came in
<br/>and seated himself at the table opposite to me, in whose pre-
<br/>sence I could not eat my dinner in peace. It is too long a
<br/>story, to tell the reasons of my antipathy to him ; he had
<br/>wronged me in a manner that debarred me from any other satis- 
<br/>faction than contempt; my dinner, though ordered, had not been
<br/>touched, and being too much excited in my feelings to make
<br/>any explanations to the clerk, I rose from the table immedi-
<br/>ately and walked out of the house, intending to return the next
<br/>day and make an apology. Now then, there was no choice,<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Delmonico’s was the next resource. Here the dinners were
<br/>quite as good, the carle as extensive, and the prices as low,
<br/>perhaps lower; but the company was more promiscuous and
<br/>the finish was not so high. I had always had an objection to
<br/>the great mirrors in the dining-room, and the monstrous bronze
<br/>chandeliers, to say nothing of two unceasing harpers who are
<br/>forever clanging the songs of the last opera, and worse than
<br/>all the black pepper in square salt cellars. These things more
<br/>than counterbalanced the white marble pillars ; but I shut my
<br/>eyes very heroically to all minor defects and entered the coffee
<br/>room with a determination of repeating the orders that I had
<br/>given at the Globe. Oysters, potage a la julienne, filet de
<br/>boeuf au champignons, and a meringue au something. Although
<br/> I never drink wine, as I have already stated, yet I sometimes
<br/> drink absynthe very much diluted, and fearing that my long fast
<br/>would injure my stomach, I stopped at the bar and called for a
<br/> glass of that bitte stuff, which I drank and put my hand in my
<br/> pocket, for the half eagle, when, O, horror ! the thought of the
<br/>thing makes me sick even now, I found only a shilling. I had
<br/>given my half eagle to that villain cab-man by mistake. My
<br/>glass of wormwood cost me a shilling, and I had not another
<br/>copper to bless myself with. What could I do ! A thought
<br/>struck me ; and a very happy thought it was ; I will order the
<br/>dinner and go and pawn my watch ; by the time that I get back
<br/>from Chatham street it will be ready and what a dinner I shall
<br/>make! I varied the order by the addition of a lobster salad
<br/>and hurried off. When I reached Chatham street I remem-
<br/>bered that ray watch was at the watchmaker’s; never mind
<br/>that, I had a gold pencil-case, but worse and worse, it was
<br/> Saturday afternoon and not a pawnbroker’s shop was open,
<br/>What religious rascals those Jews are. Every moment my
<br/>appetite was getting sharper and sharper, and I began to think
<br/>of the “French and English” dining saloons, in Nassau street,
<br/>where a plate of any thing may be had for a sixpence ; but I
<br/>hadn't the sixpence even; and Mr. Gosling, in spite of his
<br/>name is too old a bird to be caught with chaff; I could not des-
<br/>cend to ask him to give me credit for a sixpenny dinner ;
<br/>neither could I return to Delmonico’s and request them to trust
<br/>me. In passing down Nassau street I encountered the sign of
<br/>Mons. Napoleon Bunel, restaurateur from Paris. If there is
<br/>any thing in a name, I thought, this Napoleon among restau-
<br/>rateurs must be a grand place for a dinner, and if he has any
<br/>of the great qualities of his namesake he will not refuse me
<br/>credit for a filet. Hunger makes its own laws, and I had
<br/>only to obey its dictates. I made a bold push therefore into
<br/>the saloon of Mons. Bunel, and was charmed at once by the
<br/>coup d'oeil Madame B. a jolly looking creature wearing a
<br/>lace cap and violet ribbons, sat behind the bar, in the character
<br/>of dame du Comptoir; a large boquet of roses and a box of
<br/>segars on either side of her. The floor was sanded, which I
<br/>disliked, it gives one the feeling of dining in the street ; the
<br/>walls were painted by some unhappy artist who had made ter-
<br/>rible work in trying to give a resemblance of trees and green
<br/>fields, which rather added to the outer-doorishness of the
<br/>saloon. However, I am never given to fault finding, and I had
<br/>no disposition to be critical just then ; so I took my seat at one
<br/>of the marble slabs, and opened the yellow covered carte with
<br/>a palpitation of the heart. A tall lusty looking garcon in a
<br/>white jacket stood by me with his ear a little inclined towards
<br/>ray mouth to catch the first accents of my order. I had set
<br/>my heart upon potage a la julien and so forth, and I gave the
<br/>same order that I had given at the Globe and Delmonico’s, with
<br/>the addition of a fricandeau, and a Charlotte ruse, for
<br/>my appetite had grown to a boundless craving. Off ran
<br/>the garcon and I heard the confused sound of deshuits

<br/>a tin tube that communicated with the kitchen. I de-
<br/>bated with myself one moment whether it would be better to
<br/>ask Mons. Bunel to give me credit before or after eating the
<br/>dinner, but I decided at once on the first as being the most
<br/>honorable, although the latter would be the most certain. Ac-
<br/>cordingly I beckoned to Mons. B. who came to me with a smile
<br/>on his countenance and a spotless napkin on his arm. You
<br/>have a capital place here, Mons. Bunel, quite a little Rocher ;
<br/>Mons. bowed. I have ordered a bit of a dinner, some soup
<br/>and a trifle or two, but I made the oddest mistake just now in
<br/>giving a cabman a half eagle for a shilling, and I have not got
<br/>another copper in my pocket and the banks being closed I can-
<br/>not get any money before to-morrow. I suppose you will have
<br/>no objections to giving me credit for my dinner ?</p>
                <p>Mons. never smiled again, at least in my presence ;—he not
<br/>only refused to trust me, but he refused to take my gold pencil
<br/>in pawn; expressing some doubts of its being honestly come
<br/>by. At that moment the waiter made his appearance with the
<br/>Shrewsburys and the lemon, but they immediately disappeared
<br/>again, and I was compelled to make my retreat under the search-
<br/>ing eyes of Madame and all the guests at the tables.</p>
                <p>What must I do ? What could I do ? I was completely at
<br/>my wit’s end. A happy thought popped into my head. The
<br/>proprietor of the Franklin coffee-house knew me well. He would
<br/>trust me of course. I hurried immediately down to his estab-
<br/>lishment, and looked at the larder as I passed into the dining-
<br/>room. What a magnificent sight his larder is ! Turkies, sad-
<br/>dles of mutton, salmon, lobsters, sirloins, rounds of beef, roasting-
<br/>pigs, cauliflowers and strawberries. These were a few of the
<br/>objects that caught my eye, and I determined at once upon a
<br/>thorough English dinner. Confound your potages and frican-
<br/>deaus. I will have, I said, as I walked into this glorious eating-
<br/>house, salmon and melted butter, a mug of ale, roast lamb and
<br/>mint sauce, with potatoes and cauliflowers, then a magnificent
<br/>slice of roast beef with asparagus, and bread and butter ; then
<br/>a rhubarb tart and Gloster cheese, and a dish of strawberries
<br/>and cream. This is one of the most enticing places to a
<br/>hearty eater that New-York can boast of. Everything about
<br/>it is solid and substantial,—long marble counters, old mahogany
<br/>chairs, thick, heavy and comfortable, immense mirrors, pic-
<br/>tures of game and sporting scenes ; and then the host himself,
<br/>bluff, red-faced, bull-necked and hearty, with immense jowls,
<br/>and a mouth that seems to have been made expressly for
<br/>eating ; one of those plethoric apertures which one never
<br/>anticipates any good thing from, notwithstanding that good
<br/>things are continually going in thereat. Like certain favorites
<br/>of the public who are in constant receipt of favors, but never
<br/>make any bestowals in return.</p>

         <div class="head">MORELLA.</div>
          <p>Avro KaΘ’ avro μεΘ' avrov, μovo εidες aiεi ov.
<br/>Itself, by itself solely, one everlastingly, and single.
<br/>Plato. Sympos.</p>
           <p>With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded
<br/>my friend Morelia. Thrown by accident into her society many
<br/>years ago, my soul, from our first meeting, burned with fires it
<br/>had never before known; but the fires were not of Eros , and
<br/>bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction
<br/>that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning, or re-
<br/>gulate their vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us
<br/>together at the altar; and I never spoke of passion, nor
<br/>thought of love. She, however, shunned society, and,attaching
<br/>herself to me alone, rendered me happy. It is a happiness to
<br/>wonder ;—it is a happiness to dream.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <p>Morelia’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her tal-
<br/>ents were of no common order—her powers of mind were gi-
<br/>gantic. I felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I
<br/>soon, however, found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg
<br/>education, she placed before me a number of those mystical
<br/>writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the
<br/>early German literature. These, for what reason I could not
<br/>imagine, were her favorite and constant study—and that, in
<br/>process of time they became my own, should be attributed to the
<br/>simple but effectual influence of habit and example.</p>
            <p>In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My con-
<br/>victions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by
<br/>the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read,
<br/>to be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my
<br/>deeds or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned my-
<br/>self implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an
<br/>unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And then
<br/>—then, when, pouring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden
<br/>spirit enkindling within me—would Morelia place her cold hand
<br/>upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philoso-
<br/>phy some low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned
<br/>themselves in upon my memory. And then, hour after hour,
<br/>would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her
<br/>voice—until, at length, its melody was tainted with terror,—and
<br/>there fell a shadow upon my soul—and I grew pale, and shud-
<br/>dered inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And thus, joy
<br/>suddenly faded into horror, and the most beautiful became the
<br/>most hideous, as Hinnon became Ge-Henna.</p>
            <p>It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disqui-
<br/>sitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,
<br/>formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of
<br/>Morelia and myself. By the learned in what might be termed
<br/>theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the
<br/>unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The
<br/>wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified NaXtyyEVEOia of the
<br/>Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urg-
<br/>ed by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion pre-
<br/>senting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morelia. That
<br/>identity which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly de-
<br/>fines to consist in the sameness of a rational being. And since
<br/>by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason,
<br/>and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies
<br/>thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call
<br/>ourselves—thereby distinguishing us from other beings that
<br/>think, and giving us our personal identity. But the principium
<br/>individuationis—the notion of that identity which at death is or
<br/>is not lost forever, was to me—at all times, a consideration of
<br/>intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting na-
<br/>ture of its consequences, than from the marked and agitated
<br/>manner in which Morelia mentioned them.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of
<br/>my wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer
<br/>bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her mu-
<br/>sical language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she
<br/>knew all this, but did not upbraid ; she seemed conscious of
<br/>my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She
<br/>seemed, also, conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the
<br/>gradual alienation of my regard ; but she gave me no hint or
<br/>token of its nature. Yet was she woman, and pined away
<br/>daily. In time, the crimson spot settled steadily upon the
<br/>cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became pro-
<br/>minent ; and, one instant, my nature melted into pity, but, in the
<br/>next, I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul
<br/>sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who ga-
<br/>zes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.</p>
            <p>Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consu-
<br/>ming desire for the moment of Morelia’s decease? I did ; but
<br/>the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days—
<br/>for many weeks and irksome months—until my tortured nerves
<br/>obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through
<br/>delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days, and the
<br/>hours, and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and
<br/>lengthen as her gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying
<br/>of the day.</p>
            <p>But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heav-
<br/>en, Morelia called me to her bed-side. There was a dim mist
<br/>over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and, amid
<br/>the rich October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firma-
<br/>ment had surely fallen.</p>
            <p>“ It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached ; “ a day of
<br/>all days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page389"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>earth an life—ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and
<br/>death!”</p>
            <p>I kissed her forehead, and she continued:</p>
            <p>“I am dying, yet shall I live.”</p>
            <p>“ Morella!”</p>
            <p>“ The days have never been when thou couldst love me—
<br/>but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt
<br/>adore. ”</p>
            <p>“ Morelia !”</p>
            <p>“I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of
<br/>that affection—ah, how little !—which thou didst feel for me,
<br/>Morelia. And when my spirit departs shall the child live—thy
<br/>child and mine, Morelia’s. But thy days shall be days of sor-
<br/>row—that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions, as
<br/>the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For the hours of thy
<br/>happiness are over; and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as
<br/>the roses of Paestum twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer,
<br/>then, play the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myr-
<br/>tle and the vine, thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on
<br/>earth, as do the Moslemin at Mecca.”</p>
            <p>“Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this ?”—
<br/>but she turned away her face upon the pillow, and, a slight
<br/>tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her
<br/>voice no more.</p>
            <p>Yet, as she had foretold, her child—to which in dying she
<br/>had given birth, and which breathed not until the mother breath-
<br/>ed no more—her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew
<br/>strangely in stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemb-
<br/>lance of her who had departed, and I loved her with a love more
<br/>fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen
<br/>of earth.</p>
            <p>But, ere long, the heaven of this pure affection became dark-
<br/>ened, and gloom, and horror, and grief, swept over it in clouds.
<br/>I said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence.—
<br/>Strange indeed was her rapid increase in bodily size—but ter-
<br/>riable, oh ! terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowd-
<br/>ed upon me while watching the development of her mental be-
<br/>ing. Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered in the
<br/>conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the
<br/>woman ?—when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of
<br/>infancy ? and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity I
<br/>found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye ? When,
<br/>I say, all this became evident to my appalled senses—when I
<br/>could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from those
<br/>perceptions which trembled to receive it—is it to be wondered
<br/>at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon
<br/>my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild
<br/>tales and thrilling theories of the entombed Morelia? I snatch-
<br/>ed from the scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny com-
<br/>pelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my home,
<br/>watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned
<br/>the beloved.</p>
            <p>And, as years rolled away, and I gazed, day after day, upon
<br/>her holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her ma-
<br/>turing form, day after day did I discover new points of resemb-
<br/>lance in the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead.
<br/>And, hourly, grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more
<br/>full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously
<br/>terrible in their aspect. For that her smile was like her moth-
<br/>er’s I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect identity
<br/>—that her eyes were like Morella’s I could endure ; but then
<br/>they too often looked down into the depths of my soul with
<br/>Morelia’s own intense and bewildering meaning. And in the
<br/>contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken
<br/>hair, and in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein,
<br/>and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and above all—oh,
<br/>above all—in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the
<br/>lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consuming 
<br/>thought and horror—for a worm that would not die.</p>
            <p>Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and, as yet, my
<br/>daughter remained nameless upon the earth. “ My child” and
<br/>“ my love” were the designations usually prompted by a father’s
<br/>affection, and the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other
<br/>intercourse. Morella’s name died with her at her death. Of
<br/>the mother I had never spoken to the daughter;—it was impos-
<br/>sible to speak. Indeed, during the brief period of her existence
<br/>the latter had received no impressions from the outward world
<br/>save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of
<br/>her privacy. But at length the ceremony of baptism presented
<br/>to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present 
<br/>deliverance from the terrors of my destiny. And at the baptis-
<br/>mal fount I hesitated for a name. And many titles of the wise<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign
<br/>lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of
<br/>the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What prompted me,
<br/>then, to disturb the memory of the buried dead ? What demon
<br/>urged me to breathe that sound, which, in its very recollection
<br/>was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the
<br/>temples to the heart ? What fiend spoke from the recesses of
<br/>my soul, when, amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the
<br/>night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables
<br/>—Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the features of
<br/>my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting
<br/>at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from
<br/>the earth to heaven, and, falling prostrate on the black slabs of
<br/>our ancestral vault, responded—“ I am here!”</p>
            <p>Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds
<br/>within my ear, and thence, like molten lead, rolled hissingly into
<br/>my brain. Years—years may pass away, but the memory of
<br/>that epoch—never! Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers
<br/>and the vine—but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed
<br/>me night and day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place,
<br/>and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the
<br/>earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me, like flitting shad-
<br/>ows, and among them all I beheld only—Morella. The winds
<br/>of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and
<br/>the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore—Morelia. But
<br/>she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I
<br/>laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces of the
<br/>first, in the charnel where I laid the second—Morella.</p>

         <div class="head">A Holiday on the Hudson</div>
          <p>A Holiday on the Hudson.—Last Monday was a red-
<br/>letter day in the lives of four or five hundred happy souls, who
<br/> made a trip in the new steamer Niagara to West Point.
<br/>The sun was bright, the breeze fresh, the waters blue, and the
<br/>new boat for the time was the flower of the river. She
<br/>should be called the Flor-del-rio. Nothing could be more
<br/>inappropriate for such a joyous craft than to call her a
<br/>floating palace. There never was half the light and grace-
<br/>ful elegance in any palace that ever was built. The Niagara
<br/>is a day boat, and her cabin forms one spacious saloon two
<br/>hundred and seventy feet in length, without any of those
<br/>stifling encumbrances, called berths, which give to night boats
<br/>the appearance of soldiers barracks. All the appointments of
<br/>the boat are quite perfect at a matter of course, and she pre-
<br/>sents, in her interior, the appearance of a picture gallery, so
<br/>profusely are her pannels decorated with prettily executed
<br/>paintings. Besides a capital band of music on the upper deck,
<br/>there was piano-forte playing in the ladies cabin ; and several
<br/>amateur musicians very obligingly sang duets and solos. But
<br/>even without the music there was no lack of harmony. The
<br/>boat arrived at West Point about two in the afternoon, and gave
<br/>an opportunity for a ramble over that romantic and interesting
<br/>region, to those who were in search of the picturesque; but
<br/>others availed themselves of a chance to witness an examina-
<br/>tion of a class of cadets in chemistry. Among the dignitaries
<br/>who wore gold lace on the occasion, was Gen. Scott, his big
<br/>burly figure being considerably increased in its proportions, by
<br/>epauletts and other gilt appliances. Mr. Weir was also among
<br/>the examiners, and he sat leaning his head upon his hand, look-
<br/>ing very fat and contented. The steamer left the dock at three,
<br/>and soon after a sumptuous repast was served up, of unusual
<br/>elegance for a floating palace. A good many bottles of cham-
<br/>pagne were emptied, but no toasts or set speeches marred the
<br/>joyousness of the occasion. Then there were music and sing-
<br/>ing again, and afterwards cotillions and the Polka. Before
<br/>reaching the dock, Mr. Embury of Brooklyn, was put into a
<br/>velvet rocking-chair and proclaimed chairman of a meeting,
<br/>which passed some grateful resolutions in which not one half
<br/>the good nature was expressed that was felt. We remember
<br/>the last one only, which we are sure everybody else must also
<br/>remember.</p>
            <p>“ Resolved., That the Steamer Niagara will be as distinguished in
<br/>the waters of the east, as the great Cataract whose name she bears
<br/>is among the waters of the west.”</p>

            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“La vie est un somneil, l'amour en est la reve."
<br/>A sad, sweet dream! It fell upon my soul
<br/>When song and thought first woke their echoes there,
<br/>Swaying my spirit to its wild control,
<br/>And with the shadow of a fond despair,
<br/>Darkening the fountain of my young life’s stream,
<br/>It haunts me still and yet I know 'tis but a dream.
<br/>Whence art thou, shadowy presence, that canst hide
<br/>From my charmed sight the glorious things of earth ?
<br/>A mirage o’er life's desert dost thou glide ?
<br/>Or with those glimmerings of a former birth,
<br/>A “ trailing cloud of glory,” hast thou come
<br/>From some bright world afar, our unremembered home ?
<br/>I know thou dwell’st not in this dull, cold Real,
<br/>I know thy home is in some brighter sphere,
<br/>I know I shall not meet thee, my Ideal,
<br/>In the dark wanderings that await me here ;
<br/>Why comes thy gentle image then, to me,
<br/>Wasting my night of life in one long dream of thee ?
<br/>The city’s peopled solitude, the glare
<br/>Of festal halls, moonlight, and music’s tone,
<br/>All breathe the sad refrain—thou art not there ;
<br/>And even with nature I am still alone;
<br/>With joy I see her summer bloom depart;
<br/>I love stern winter’s reign— ’tis winter in my heart.
<br/>And if I sigh upon my brow to see
<br/>The deep'ning shadow of Time’s restless wing,
<br/>'Tis for the youth I might not give to thee.
<br/>The vanished brightness of my first sweet spring;
<br/>That I might give thee not the joyous form
<br/>Unworn by tears and cares, unblighted by the storm.
<br/>And when the hearts I should be proud to win,
<br/>Breathe, in those tones that woman holds so dear,
<br/>Words of impassioned homage unto mine,
<br/>Coldly and harsh they fall upon my ear,
<br/>And as I listen to the fervent vow
<br/>My weary heart replies, “ Alas, it is not thou !”
<br/>Depart, O shadow ! fatal dream, depart!
<br/>Go, I conjure thee, leave me this poor life,
<br/>And I will meet with firm, heroic heart,
<br/>Its threat’ning storms and its tumultuous strife,
<br/>And with the poet-seer will see thee stand
<br/>To welcome my approach to thine own Spirit-land.
<br/>And when the thoughts within my spirit glow
<br/>That would out-pour themselves in words of fire,
<br/>If some kind influence bade the music flow
<br/>Like that which woke the notes of Memnon's lyre,
<br/>Thou, sunlight of my life, wak’st not the lay
<br/>And song within my heart unuttered dies away.</div>

            <div class="lg">
               <br/>I’ve met thee, whom I dared not hope to meet
<br/>Save in th’ enchanted land of my day dreams:
<br/>Yes, in this common world, this waking state,
<br/>Thy living presence on my vision beams,<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>Life’s dream embodied in reality !
<br/>And in thine eyes I read indifference to me !
<br/>Yes, in those star-like eyes I read my fate,
<br/>My horoscope is written in their gaze:
<br/>My “house of life” henceforth is desolate;
<br/>But the dark aspect my firm heart surveys.
<br/>Nor faints nor falters even for thy sake,—
<br/>’Tis calm and nerved and strong—no, no, it shall not break.
<br/>For I am of that mood that will defy ;
<br/>That does not cower before the gathering storm ;
<br/>That face to face will meet its destiny,
<br/>And undismayed confront its darkest form.
<br/>Wild energies awaken in this strife,
<br/>This conflict of the soul with the grim phantom Life.
<br/>But ah ! if thou hadst loved me! had I been
<br/>All to thy dreams that to mine own thou art.
<br/>Had those dark eyes beamed eloquent on mine,
<br/>Pressed for one moment to that noble heart
<br/>In the full consciousness of faith unspoken,
<br/>Life could have given no more—then had my proud heart
<br/>broken!
<br/>The Alpine glacier from its height may mock
<br/>The clouds and lightnings of the winter sky,
<br/>And from the tempest and the thunder’s shock
<br/>Gather new strength to lift its summit high ;
<br/>But kissed by sunbeams of the summer day
<br/>It bows its icy crest and weeps itself away.
<br/>Thou know’st the fable of the Grecian maid
<br/>Wooed by the veiled immortal from the skies,
<br/>How in his full perfections, once she prayed,
<br/>That he would stand before her longing eyes,
<br/>And how that brightness, too intense to bless,
<br/>Consumed her o’er-wrought heart with its divine excess.
<br/>To me there is a meaning in the tale.
<br/>I have not prayed to meet thee; I can brook
<br/>That thou shouldst wear to me that icy veil;
<br/>I can give back thy cold and careless look ;
<br/>Yet shrined within my heart still thou shalt seem,

         <div class="head">A JUST VIEW OF A BAD HABIT.</div>
          <p>We find the following very sensible remarks, in a late num-
<br/>ber of the Charleston Mercury, and we copy them to give cur-
<br/>rency to such excellent sentiments. But we must resist the
<br/>imputation of the last sentence. We think that New York is
<br/>the debtor in this case.</p>
           <p>A New Image of War.—Among the men of former times, hunt-
<br/>ing was termed “ the image of war"—especially the pursuit of
<br/>wild boars, lions and other ferocious beasts. It had some claim to
<br/>the distinction. It combined violent exercise, personal peril, the
<br/>submission to privation and the distinctions, of success, skill and
<br/>courage. In our day there is enough said about “ campaigns,”
<br/>“ battles,” "victories,” “ defeats,” “ glory” and all that, to make a
<br/>stranger think we were engaged incessantly in the business of
<br/>knocking each other’s brains out—that a bloody and desolating
<br/>civil war was waged from year’s end to year’s end. What sort of
<br/>fight and what sort of victory it is, we need not explain. But the
<br/>dialect is perfectly devilish, and its use is, we are persuaded, of
<br/>most demoralizing consequence. Those of the opposite party we
<br/>call the “ enemy when we put them out of office, we call them
<br/>the “ vanquished,”—and contrary to the laws of modern war, we
<br/>proceed to treat them as criminals. Dismissing them from office
<br/>is known by the terms “slaughtering,” " guilatining,” “ cutting off
<br/>heads,” and simillar bloody-minded phrases.</p>
            <p>Now aside from the bad taste of using such murderous language,
<br/>it can hardly fail that this habitual dressing up of our party contests
<br/>in the phraseology of war and crime, does tend insensibly to em-
<br/>bitter them; to deprive the elections of their peaceable character,
<br/>and to deepen in personal feeling the differences of opinion on pub-
<br/>lic measures. In our dialect too, the offices of the country are the
<br/>" spoil” of the successful party, and they are seized upon as the
<br/>plunder of the “ enemy.” All this vile phraseology and much of
<br/>the equally vile practices connected with it, we owe to New York.</p>

            <p>Now, who could expect, after reading the above, to find what
<br/>follows from the pen of the same writer in the same column of
<br/>the same paper. It will require no very extraordinary gift in 
<br/>this case, for the Editor of the Mercury to see himself as
<br/>others see him, if he will be at the trouble of reading both his
<br/>articles at the same sitting.</p>
            <p>The South awoke—with one hand she strangled one Presiden-
<br/>tial candidate, and with the other, she drew that old sword, (the 
<br/>proud spirit of the South) before whose keen edge, no foes or party, 
<br/>since the foundation of the government had ever been able to stand.
<br/>She triumphed in the Presidential election. The struggle came on ;
<br/>in Congress. She triumphed again in spite of foes and traitors,
<br/>South and North. Flushed with her recent victories, there she
<br/>stands, with stern defiance on her brow, and her yet unsheathed 
<br/>and dripping sword in her hand. Before heaven! she shall not 
<br/>sheath it, uutil she is safe, and safe forever. Texas shall be hers,
<br/>in spite of a world in arms; and to crown her redemption, the
<br/>fetters of unjust taxation shall be torn from her free limbs. She
<br/>will no longer endure to be the mock and ribald scoff of fools and
<br/>fanatics, or the impassive and plundered victim, of mean, venal
<br/>and dastard monopolists. She will vindicate her rightful station
<br/>amongst the people of the earth; and whilst fearing none, com-
<br/>mand the respect and peace of all.</p>
            <p>We do not remember ever having seen so much belligerent
<br/>bluster, and warlike word-spilling as this, in any New York
<br/>political Journal, even the day before an election. If the ,
<br/>South is really indebted to New York for her coinage of hot
<br/>words, she uses them with a degree of liberality that her
<br/>teacher never indulged in.</p>

<br/>Shape after shape of glorious light,

         <div class="head">THORWALDSEN’S STATUE OF BYRON.</div>
          <p>We copy the annexed account of this interesting work of
<br/>Art from the London Art-Union, which does not, however,
<br/>tell the whole story respecting it. The English boast a good
<br/>deal of their liberality in money affairs, and not without some
<br/>cause, while the one-string of slander on which they never
<br/>cease playing, when alluding to this country, is our worship
<br/>of the almighty dollar. But we do not remember having
<br/>met with any anecdote of American manners so thoroughly
<br/>characteristic of a mean and stingy nature as the statement
<br/>which we find in some of the London papers respecting the
<br/>monument to Lord Byron.</p>
           <p>It must be remembered that he was a lord, and his personal
<br/>friends were among the better classes, in every respect, of
<br/>English society.</p>
           <p>It appears that soon after Byron’s death, some of his friends
<br/>and admirers set about a subscription, for the purpose of plac-
<br/>ing a statue to his memory in Westminster Abbey; and
<br/>when they had gained all the money they could, they offered
<br/>the amount to Chantrey, and asked him to make the statue.
<br/>But the sum was so small that he refused to accept it, as he
<br/>said it would not half pay him for his labor; the admirers of
<br/>the noble poet applied next to Thorwaldsen, who with great
<br/>dignity of feeling told them that he could not afford to work
<br/>for nothing, and he would therefore accept the money, al-
<br/>though it was too small to be considered pay, and would give
<br/>the statue out of respect to the poet, whom he had known
<br/>personally and loved.</p>
           <p>Thorwaldsen’s Statue of Lord Byron.—This monument,
<br/>of which so much has been said and written, will at length find a
<br/>resting-place in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, after
<br/>having remained upwards of twelve years in the cellars of the
<br/>custom-house, during the whole of which period it has been more
<br/>or less—as well from its own particular history, as from the great
<br/>name to which it is dedicated—an object of public solicitude,
<br/>which of late has increased in consequence of the death of two
<br/>individuals, the name of one of whom is associated more nearly
<br/>with it than is usual in his position, while that of the other will be
<br/>remembered with various feelings in connexion with the monu-
<br/>ment of Byron—we mean the decease of the amiable sculptor
<br/>himself, and of the late Dean of Westminster. An extract of a
<br/>letter from Stockholm, which appeared in a German paper,
<br/>among other matters in reference to Thorwaldsen, stated that his
<br/>executors reclaimed the statue of Byron, and at the same time
<br/>some improbable statements appeared in our own newspapers in
<br/>reference to the work. It was hoped that on the death of Dean
<br/>Ireland the objection to its admission to Westminster Abbey might
<br/>be set aside, but his successor is on willing to impugn his decision
<br/>by a reversal. These events have perhaps had the effect of caus-
<br/>ing a destination to be determined upon for the work ; at least they
<br/>have been the means of reviving throughout Europe the circum-
<br/>stances of in execution and exclusion from Westminster Abbey.
<br/>The monument it temporarily deposited in the studio of Sir Rich-
<br/>ard Westmacott, and it the property of a body of subscribers,
<br/>friends and admirers of Byron, by whom the commission was of-
<br/>fered to Chantrey, who declined it in consequence of the inade-
<br/>quacy of the amount subscribed. It was then proposed to Thor-
<br/>waldsen, who at once undertook it, agreeing to receive the sum
<br/>collected. Many statements have been current as to whether
<br/>Thorwaldsen did or did not receive remuneration for the work. It
<br/>is mentioned as a fact that he received the subscription, and set
<br/>about the monument in admiration of the poet, and in gratitude to
<br/>his country, for he bore in mind that, while almost despairing, and
<br/>yet a young artist, he was about to return to bis own country from
<br/>want of employment in Italy—the first commission he received
<br/>was from the late Mr. Hope. The statue is life-sized, and repre-
<br/>sents the poet seated on the fragment of a rained temple, with his
<br/>left foot resting on the broken shaft of a column, while on the left,
<br/>low down, is a skull, and above that the Athenian owl. The
<br/>head seems to have been worked out from the portrait by Briggs;
<br/>with the addition of age. In a posthumous work of this kind,
<br/>had the artist perfectly succeeded, his work had been a miracle of
<br/>Art: the defects, therefore, are not his, but those of circumstances.
<br/>The forehead is heavy, and wants the refined modelling which
<br/>distinguished the head of Byron, nor is the mouth moulded into
<br/>that expression of which even years could not deprive it; the hands
<br/>are also somewhat coarse, and by no means worthy of the com-
<br/>pliment paid to those of Byron by Ali Pacha. The attire of the
<br/>figure is a frock-coat,over which is thrown a cloak; in the left<div class="pagebreak" id="#page892"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>hand is a volume superscribed “ Childe Harold,” and the right
<br/>holds a pencil or style up to the mouth, as if he were busied in
<br/>composition. As regards the destination of this statue, it is deep-
<br/>ly to be regretted that the monument of Byron has not found a
<br/>resting-place in the metropolis.</p>

              <p>An Essay on the Philosophy of Medical Science, by Elisha
<br/>Bartlett, M. D., &amp;c.—Philadelphia, Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1844.</p>
              <p>The Principles op the Chrono-thermai. System op Medicine;
with Fallacies of the Faculty. By Samuel Dickinson, M.D., &amp;c.
With introduction and notes, by William Turner, M. D., &amp;c.—
New-York, J. S. Redfield, Clinton Hall, 1845.</p>
              <p>These are two books diametrically opposite in their aims,
<br/>yet both significant signs in the Medical World; it is on this
<br/>account that we bring them together, that we may expound
<br/>their meaning, for the benefit of our readers who happen to
<br/>be uninitiated in the mysteries of Esculapius’ worship. Dr.
<br/>Bartlett, by way of preliminaries to dispose the good-natured
<br/>reader to a favorable judgment of his cause, devotes a few
<br/>chapters of his book to demonstrating what constitutes a correct
<br/>mode of observing and reasoning, or, in one word, of philoso-
<br/>phizing in exact sciences ; and having thus built a ladder, to
<br/>step upon, he drags his reader up the heights of Medical science,
<br/>showing him all the while, how firmly and securely, and how
<br/>philosophically he ascends to the possible in the knowledge of
<br/>the healing art. Doubtless, the unsuspecting, and not very
<br/>keen-sighted reader, will believe, on laying down Dr. Bart-
<br/>lett’s book, that he has drank deeply at the very source of truth.
<br/>But for ourselves who have dabbled in those matters upon
<br/>which the learned doctor is so eloquent, we can declare that
<br/>we rose from the intellectual repast which the doctor cooked
<br/>up, with a hungry stomach, for the quantity we have con-
<br/>sumed proved but a few grains of truth in a bushel of chaff.
<br/>Yet, we are free to confess that the doctor is an excellent cook
<br/>in his way, indeed, there are not many such in his profession.
<br/>There is both mechanical and intellectual legerdemain,the doc-
<br/>tor’s work is an evidence of the latter; he is a schoolman who
<br/>has learned to muster his words in a phalanx, as a drill-ser-
<br/>geant does his men, but without the aid of scholastic glasses he
<br/>is incapable of looking upon nature, and marking her workings.
<br/>The aim of the book is to teach how to philosophize in medi-
<br/>cine, but it strikes us, taking the doctrines he favors as an
<br/>evidence, that he has not learnt the art himself; for he talks
<br/>grandiloquently of such nonsense as a correct nosology, the
<br/>bug-bear of inflammation, and believes in the means of reduc-
<br/>ing it by bleeding—things that have a foundation only in the
<br/>brains of professors and their dupes, but not in nature. He
<br/>condemns hypotheses, but insists that naked facts should make
<br/>up the science. He forgets that it is as easy for those who are
<br/>not fit for the task, and these are numerous, to make wrong
<br/>experiments, and call them naked facts, as it is for another set
<br/>of persons equally unfit for their undertaking, to make incor-
<br/>rect hypotheses and call them true explanations of nature's
<br/>mysteries. The alchemists have collected numerous so-called
<br/>facts, but they did not know what to make of them, for they
<br/>experimented foolishly, and they might have gone on still
<br/>longer putting wrong questions to nature, and remain as igno-
<br/>rant as ever. It was left for the intellect of Lavoisier, Guy
<br/>Lussac and others, who could at a glance surmise correctly
<br/>nature's purposes, to question her accordingly; and thus they
<br/>were enabled to raise the structure of exact sciences.</p>
              <p>The fact is, that it is permitted but to few to make correct
<br/>hypotheses and have them verified by experience ; but those
<br/>few cannot teach others to do the same ; nor will they stop to
<br/>give us an account of the mental processes that led them to
<br/>their discoveries. There is a larger class of minds that, when<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>discoveries are made and interpreted, can logically, step by
<br/>step, verify and enlarge the experience of others, but who
<br/>would never discover anything themselves ; and there is ano-
<br/>ther class of men still more numerous, who can write upon
<br/>the correct manner of making discoveries, and collecting facts :
<br/>but yet these last are not the persons to be employed for the
<br/>purposes of the art they teach ; they are mere self-satisfied
<br/>and self-glorifying schoolmen. Dr. Bartlett’s book sufficiently
<br/>justifies us in making the above observations ; his aim seems
<br/>to have been to raise the credit of the old school of medicine,
<br/>which of late, has lost so much in public estimation. With
<br/>those who cannot see for themselves, he will undoubtedly suc-
<br/>ceed ; but there will be yet a few left, cunning enough to see
<br/>through the legerdemain of his logic, and who will persist in
<br/>mistrusting the learning of the faculty. The author of this
<br/>book is a striking illustration of that calibre of mind that can
<br/>spend itself in petty details with great gusto and considerable
<br/>credit; but is incapable by summing them up, to rise to gene-
<br/>ralities, and seize upon the secrets of nature. Unfortunately for
<br/>mankind, we had too many such men in the profession, and it
<br/>is they especially, more even than the intrinsic difficulty of the
<br/>subject, who contributed so much to swell the lumbering trash
<br/>of medical libraries. Yes, it is these men of details, and of
<br/>specialities, who split a hair with the greatest delicacy, who
<br/>mole-like cannot see beyond the mole-cast they make, that
<br/>give force to Condillac’s saying when applied to medicine,
<br/>“ that man never has so much to say of a subject, as when he
<br/>knows the least of it.” A different spirit we find in Dr.
<br/>Dickinson’s lectures. In commencing his observations, he
<br/>was fully impressed with the idea that details, different as they
<br/>may appear, merge in each other, that they may be lost in
<br/>unity,—this being an all-pervading law of nature ; and so his
<br/>results are as grand as they are just in conception. We can
<br/>speak here, with the assurance of personal experience, for in
<br/>our own studies we have come to similar though not identical
<br/>results, long before we ever heard of the Fallacies of the Fa-
<br/>culty. His views may be briefly stated to consist in unity of
<br/>disease, in variety of symptoms, the intermittent fever being
<br/>the type of all the suffering that flesh is heir to. The nervous
<br/>system in general, and the brain in particular, is the citadel
<br/>from which life issues, and which disease assails. An equili-
<br/>brium of temperature throughout the body is, in his opinion,
<br/>absolutely essential to health ; and any derangement of if,
<br/>causes as well as accompanies disease; the evident indication
<br/>in the cure therefore is, to restore it to its due degree by appro-
<br/>priate appliances. Thus periodicity of recurrence of disease
<br/>and variability of temperature are the landmarks by which the
<br/>physician is to be guided in his treatment.</p>
              <p>The doctor advocates his views with great force of reasoning
<br/>and abundance of wit and fancy ; so much so, that the book
<br/>is exceedingly attractive even to an unprofessional reader.
<br/>With unsparing severity he points out many of the learned
<br/>follies of the faculty, and with the most satisfactory proof he
<br/>confutes the unphilosophical and murderous practice of blood-
<br/>letting in all its forms.</p>
              <p>Much as we admire the common-sense views of Dr. Dickin-
<br/>son, yet we are not entirely satisfied with him, for he has over-
<br/>looked some things and underrated others. His views do not
<br/>enable us to look upon the economy of the human system, as
<br/>complete in all points; perhaps he gives us only what he sees
<br/>himself, and what is the most essential in the removal of dis-
<br/>eases. Be it as it may, he deserves our gratitude for what he has
<br/>done. It requires great moral courage to speak against the
<br/>follies of mis-called science, and especially among the most con-
<br/>servative of all classes of men. Medicine never will be thor-<div class="pagebreak" id="#page393"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>oughly reformed till men of common sense and decided talent,
<br/>whose minds are stored with a variety of information, bring their
<br/>ability to bear upon medical practices and theories, with no oth-
<br/>er aim than to advance Truth. The love of professional lucre
<br/>too often stands in the way of truth—and it is asking too much
<br/>from human nature to expect immolation of self on the altar of
<br/>truth, at the hands of the medical profession—and especially
<br/>when it is so crowded that a cunning dunce often stands a bet-
<br/>ter chance of success than a man of modest talent and upright-
<br/>ness. It should be impressed upon the minds of men that what
<br/>was said of poets is applicable to physicians with double force:
<br/>Physicians are born, not made. Many who have received their
<br/>doctorate find on their coming into the daylight of experi-
<br/>ence, that instead of the doctor’s they have been crowned with
<br/>the fool’s-cap.</p>
              <p>Looking upon the state of the medical profession in these times,
<br/>we cannot but see omens of great good to come. It is so divid-
<br/>ed by different sects holding more or less correct views, that
<br/>each must modify the other; and here and there a brave oppo-
<br/>nent arises who challenges them all; and a suspicious public
<br/>begins to be aroused from its stupidity, and thinks that
<br/>the evil is not in her body, but in that of the doctors—all this
<br/>ferment of opinion may clarify man's judgment upon the subject,
<br/>and some genius may arise who will select the truth that gives
<br/>partial currency to the pretensions of each system, and ren-
<br/>der a lasting benefit to mankind. Perhaps his name may be An-
<br/>drew Sniadecki, who some time ago developed his theory of organ-
<br/>ic beings, and whose death Poland was made too soon to lament,
<br/>or he upon whomever his cloak has fallen. We mention the dis-
<br/>tinguished Pole, because in the whole range of our medical read-
<br/>ing, we find none who applies, in a more simple and beautiful
<br/>diction, such a rigorous method of reasoning to such a vast fund
<br/>of information; so much so that medicine in his hands almost
<br/>becomes one of the exact sciences.</p>

            <div class="head">PLATO CONTRA ATHEOS</div>
              <p>PLATO CONTRA ATHEOS.—Plato against the Atheists; or the Tenth
<br/>Book of the Dialogue on Laws, accompanied with Critical Notes,
<br/>and followed by Extended Dissertations on some of the Main
<br/>Points of the Platonic Philosophy and Theology, especially as
<br/>compared with the Holy Scriptures, by Tayler Lewis, LL. D.,
<br/>Professor of the Greek Language and Literature, in the Univer-
<br/>sity in the city of New York.—New York, Harper &amp; Brothers.</p>
              <p>The Laws of Plato were probably the work of his old age
<br/>—of his extreme senility—and although Dr. Lewis insists
<br/>upon this point, as one tending to make us think more favora-
<br/>bly of the composition, on the ground of its embodying the
<br/>philosopher’s most matured and best settled opinions—we can-
<br/>not help regarding the question as disputable. As a dramatic
<br/>work, all admit it to be inferior to the Republic. There are
<br/>but three interlocutors—Clinias, a Cretan; Megillus, a Spar-
<br/>tan ; and a stranger, who is spoken of only as the Athenian
<br/>—but, who is the Socrates of the colloquy; the two first, be-
<br/>ing merely listeners, or speaking but for the purpose of foils.
<br/>The nine first books are occupied with legislative schemes
<br/>given at length, with preambles, and arguments in support of
<br/>both preambles and schemes. The tenth book (now published)
<br/>deals with laws enacted against violators of religion—that is
<br/>to say, public worship—it being taken for granted that State
<br/>and Church can never properly exist apart. The greater por-
<br/>tion—indeed nearly the whole of the book, however, is taken
<br/>up with an exordium, investigating the reasons for the laws— 
<br/>the latter in fact occupying only a few of the concluding
<br/>pages.</p>
              <p>The argument is directed first, against those who deny the
<br/>Divine existence—secondly, against those who deny a Provi-
<br/>dence while admitting the existence of a God—thirdly, against
<br/>those who, admitting both, yet maintain that the Deity is easily
<br/>propitiated by sinners.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
              <p>Clinias opens the first branch of this argument, by asserting
<br/>that the existence of God is readily shown by the universality
<br/>of man’s belief in his existence, as well as by the evidences
<br/>of design in natural phenomena.</p>
              <p>This ease of demonstration the Athenian denies ; declaring,
<br/>however, that whatever difficulty there is, is not innate in the
<br/>subject, but springs from the perverseness of the Ionic Atheists
<br/>in imposing upon the world the ideas of chance, nature, art,
<br/>etc., and in the refutation of these ideas the reasoner discusses
<br/>at length the nature of soul as involving, necessarily, self-
<br/>motion. Thence, he deduces the priority in time of soul to
<br/>body—thence, again, of the properties of soul to the proper-
<br/>ties of body. The inference is, that Art is the mother of Nature
<br/>—that law, will, thought, or design, must have been before
<br/>qualities, such as hardness, weight—etc, etc.</p>
              <p>The intention here is to refute the particular opinion of the
<br/>Atheist, that religion had no better foundation than conventi-
<br/>onality, since belief in the existence of God is the production
<br/>of human law—which, again, is a product of Art—Art itself
<br/>being regarded as the offspring of Nature.</p>
              <p>The question of motion is examined very minutely—and all
<br/>kinds of motion are divided into motion by impulse, and, that
<br/>which moves something else by commencing motion in itself;
<br/>the latter species being psyche, or soul.</p>
              <p>In the next place, occurs the question whether one or more
<br/>souls are at work in the Universe. It is decided that there
<br/>are two—the soul of good and the soul of evil.</p>
              <p>The second grand division of the subject is the investiga-
<br/>tion of the arguments which deny a Providence. The Athe-
<br/>nian maintains a minute, special interference with human af-
<br/>fairs, chiefly on the ground that the whole is composed of its
<br/>parts, and that to neglect the smallest portion is to neglect the
<br/>whole.</p>
              <p>In entering the third division of his theme, the speaker op-
<br/>poses the arguments of those who maintain that the Deity is
<br/>easily appeased, by adverting to the pre-supposed antagonism
<br/>between good and evil. Where a conflict is continually going
<br/>on, he says, the least neutrality or supineness—that is to say,
<br/>the least mercy shown to sin, would be treason against the
<br/>cause of the Right throughout the Universe.</p>
              <p>The offenders against religion are divided into six classes,
<br/>or rather grades. The book ends with a specification of pen-
<br/>alties, and a law, in especial against private rites and churches.</p>
              <p>Such is a fair, although very succinct synopsis of a work
<br/> comparatively little known, although very frequently made the
<br/>subject of converse.</p>
              <p>No one can doubt the purity and nobility of the Platonian
<br/>soul, or the ingenuity of the Platonian intellect. But if the
<br/>question be put to-day, what is the value of the Platonian
<br/>philosophy, the proper answer is—“ exactly nothing at all."
<br/>We do not believe that any good purpose is answered by popu-
<br/>larizing his dreams ; on the contrary we do believe that they
<br/>have a strong tendency to ill—intellectually of course.</p>
              <p>We could wish that Dr. Lewis (however excusable may be
<br/>his evident enthusiasm for his favorite) had less frequently in-
<br/>terspersed his comments with such passages as the following :</p>
              <p>“ Then surely should Plato be studied, if for no other purpose, as a
<br/>matter of curiosity, to see if there may not possibly bo some other philo-
<br/>sophy than this noisy Baconianism about which there is kept UP
<br/>such AN EverlASTING DIN, or that still more noisy because more empty
<br/> transcendentalism which some would present as its only antidote.</p>
              <p>* * * * Especially will this be the case at a time when physical
<br/>science, in league with a subtle pantheism, is everywhere substituting
<br/>its jargon of laws and elements, nebular star-dust, and vital forces,
<br/>and magnetic fluids, for the recognition of a personal God and an ever
<br/>wakeful, ever energizing special Providence.”</p>
              <p>For our own parts we vastly prefer even the noise of Bacon,
<br/>the laws of Combe, or the nebular star-dust of Nichols to
<br/>what Dr. Lewis will insist upon terming " the clear, simple,<div class="pagebreak" id="#page394"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>common-sense philosophy of Plato,”—but these things are
<br/>perhaps merely matters of taste. It would be as well, how-
<br/>ever, to bear in mind the aphoristic sentence of Leibnitz—“ La
<br/>plupart des sectes ont raison en beaucoup de ce qu'lles avan-
<br/>cent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles nient."</p>
              <p>We regret that it has been thought advisable to give the
<br/>Greek text unaccompanied with a translation. The object, so
<br/>far as we can comprehend the annotator, seems to have been
<br/>the placing of the doctrines of Plato more immediately with-
<br/>in the reach of the public. For this end we should have had
<br/>a paraphrase, at least.</p>

            <div class="head">Harper's Illuminated and Illustrated Edition of Shakespeare</div>
              <p>Harper's Illuminated and Illustrated Edition of Shakes-
<br/>peare. Nos. 55 &amp; 56 : Containing parts of “ As You Like It,”
<br/>and “ Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Price 25cts.</p>
              <p>We have already expressed a favorable opinion of this truly
<br/>beautiful edition of Shakespeare ; but the present issue comes to
<br/>us with so liberal an enrichment of wood cuts, that we cannot
<br/>refrain from expressing once more our opinion of its cheapness
<br/>and beauty. Here are twenty-nine spirited wood cuts, from
<br/>good designs, printed with great clearness and beauty in ink of
<br/>unusual brilliancy and on fine paper, accompanying a play by
<br/>Shakespeare, and sold for the inconsiderable price of 25 cents.
<br/>The cover to this edition of Shakespeare is a very handsome de-
<br/>sign by Catherwood, a thousand times superior to the hideous
<br/>thing designed by R. W. Weir, N. A. A more thoroughly
<br/>contemptible affair, exhibiting not only an utter poverty of imag-
<br/>ination, but the most meagre acquirements in art, was never
<br/>put off upon the public, than the cover which was first published
<br/>by Mr. Hewitt, when this edition of Shakespeare was issued
<br/>by him. Thanks to the liberality and discernment of the
<br/>present publishers, we are no longer annoyed by the appa-
<br/>rition of the Weir sisters, and the figure of Shakespeare in a
<br/>canoe, on the cover of these plays. It is a disgrace to Ameri-
<br/>can Art, that we have never been able to produce the shadow of
<br/>an ornamental design, and nothing can more plainly prove the
<br/>entire inadequacy of the system of instruction adopted by our
<br/>National Academy than the wretched abortions which the artists
<br/>who write N. A. at the end of their names, have produced in
<br/>their attempts at ornamental drawings. They prove beyond a
<br/>question that they have not been grounded in the A. B. C. of
<br/>art. Now that the academy has got an artist for its President,
<br/>we have hopes that something better may be produced.</p>
              <p>Mr. Verplanck is doubtless very competent to edit Shakes-
<br/>peare, but we have noticed some very strange readings in one
<br/>or two of the earlier issues of the edition, which must have been
<br/>owing either to gross carelessness, or something worse.</p>
              <p>We take a few passages only for example. Where it is mate-
<br/>rial, we point according to copy,</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Is execution done on Cawdor: or not

               <br/>And all things unbecoming.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>" To be thus is nothing,
<br/>But to be safely thus;"</div>
             <p>A more weighty point than a comma is wanted after “ noth-
<br/>ing.”</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings !”</div>
             <p>Same after “ kings”—and “ seeds” should be seed.</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Now, go to the door,”</div>
             <p>Should be:</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>Now to the door.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ To pray for this good man,”</div>
             <p>Should be:</p>

               <br/>To pray for that good man.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>" Whom we to gain our peace, have sent to peace,”</div>
             <p>Should be:</p>

               <br/>Whom we, to gain our place, have sent to peace.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>—“ the feast is sold,
<br/>That is not often vouch’d while 'tis a making ;
<br/>'Tis given with welcome.”</div>
             <p>A comma after “ vouch’d” and another after “ making,” in
<br/>the room of the semicolon there, would have given the true read-
<br/>ing—which is turned into nonsense by the false pointing in this
<br/>new edition.</p>
              <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ If trembling I inhabit then,”</div>

             <p>Where is the other mark of this parenthesis ?</p>
             <p>But this is painful work: we will therefore end it, for the pres-
<br/>ent, by a short notice of something that, in itself, is enough to
<br/>injure the whole edition in which it occurs,—we mean, in the
<br/>opinion of Shakespeare’s “lovers.”</p>
              <p>The play is Twelth Night. In the first interview between
<br/>Olivia and Viola, Olivia, after Viola has said, “ Good madam,
<br/>let me see your face,” is made to reply, “ Have you any com-
<br/>mission from your lord to negociate with my face ? You are
<br/>now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain, and show
<br/>you the picture. Look you, sir; such a one I was this present:
<br/>is’t not well done !” [Unveiling.]</p>
              <p>Now, which looks most like Shakespeare, that, or this :</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Look you, Sir: Such a one as I was, this presents.
<br/>Is’t not well done ?”—[ Unveiling. ]</div>
              <p>The word “ as,” the comma after “ was,” and the addition-
<br/>al s to the word “ present,” make all the difference.</p>

            <div class="head">A Pilgrimage to Treves</div>
             <p> A Pilgrimage to Treves, through the Valley of the Meuse and
<br/>the Forest of Ardennes in the year 1844. Harper &amp; Brothers,
<br/>1845.</p>
             <p>We have here another new book from the pen of an American,
<br/>and a very modest and entertaining one it is. The author, a
<br/>son of the Rev. Dr. Anthon of this city, says that, having de-
<br/>termined to “ attempt the production of a book," he took up his
<br/>residence in Spa to carry on its manufacture, for three sensible
<br/>reasons; first because it is a pleasant place to live in ; secondly
<br/>because it is a fashionable watering place which being deserted
<br/>at that time afforded him excellent accommodations ; and
<br/>thirdly because it is in the vicinity of Liege and Brussels, from
<br/>which cities he could obtain all the books of which he stood in
<br/>need. We like this manner of producing a book, and we only
<br/>regret that all authors cannot, like Mr. Anthon, select their
<br/>cities of refuge when the fit of production comes over them.
<br/>But there have been many books produced in garrets and
<br/>prisons and other places very far from being pleasant, which<div class="pagebreak" id="#page395"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>will be read with delight, and have power to make any place
<br/>pleasant when the “ Pilgrimage to Treves” will have been
<br/>utterly forgotten.</p>
              <p>We do not mean to underrate Mr. Anthon’s work because
<br/>it was produced under circumstances so exceedingly agreeable.
<br/>There are but few young gentlemen of his years and opportu-
<br/>nities who ever think of producing a book at all, or if they
<br/>should make the attempt, would succeed as well as he has
<br/>done.</p>
              <p>The author begins his book with Charlemagne and Aix-la-
<br/>Chapelle and serves up anew several bits of history which do
<br/>not possess much novelty to recommend them. The “ Pil-
<br/>grimage” is not commenced until we reach the middle of the
<br/>book, when the interest of the work begins. The author set
<br/>out from Dinant on the 4th of September to join the pilgrims
<br/>who were flocking in immense numbers to Treves to witness
<br/>the exhibition of the sacred robe of Christ which happens to
<br/>be in possession of the church of that city. Mr. Anthon in-
<br/>forms us, however, that he does not himself attach any impor-
<br/>tance to relics, and very conclusively argues that the chances
<br/>are a considerable many to nothing that Christ never had the
<br/>sacred robe of Treves on his back.</p>
              <p>In some of his descriptions he is sufficiently exact, but in
<br/>others he is exceedingly vague and uncertain : for instance, in
<br/>speaking of Hardenne, a seat of the King of the Belgians, he
<br/>says it is “ furnished in a style of simple elegance,” which
<br/>must be interpreted according to the reader’s own ideas of
<br/>what constitutes simple elegance. Probably some readers if
<br/>made acquainted with the realities of Hardenne would say
<br/>that it was furnished in a style of the most superb and thrill-
<br/>ing magnificence, for we saw in one of our morning papers, a
<br/>day or two since, an allusion to a new Broadway Omnibus
<br/>which was styled “ a truly palacial carriage,” and every news-
<br/>paper reader know's that all the steamboats in our waters are
<br/>“ floating palaces.”</p>
              <p>The sacred tunic was presented to Treves by the Empress
<br/>Helena, she having procured it in Palestine three hundred
<br/>years after the crucifixion.</p>
              <p>"Since the exposition which took place in the year 1512, the
<br/>Tunic has been publicly displayed nine times, seven times a
<br/>Treves and twice at Ehrenbreitstein, to which place it bad been
<br/>transported on account of the risk of destruction or plunder to
<br/>which it was exposed during the war which distracted Germany
<br/>The last exposition occurred in 1810, and lasted 19 days. The
<br/>number of strangers who visited Treves during this time am-
<br/>ounted to 227,000. According to the belief of some, miracu-
<br/>lous cures were wrought by the sight and touch of the relic. I is
<br/>said that many paralytics, and other persons so sick or infirm that
<br/>they had to be carried before it, afterward walked without as-
<br/>sistance.</p>
              <p> Those who dread the predominance of the Roman Catholic
<br/>faith, and look with anxiety on the signs which seem to indicate
<br/>that she is about to resume much of her ancient dominion, will be
<br/>struck by the fact that the exposition of the sacred Robe in the
<br/>year 1844 has attracted a greater host of pilgrims than on any pre-
<br/>vious occasion. The number of strangers who visited Treves from
<br/>the 17th of August to the 6th of October amounted to upward of
<br/>450,000 !"</p>
              <p>The sacred robe is deposited in a chamber of the Cathedral,
where it is kept except on occasions of exhibition.</p>
              <p>"The crowd of pilgrims entering the great portal on the right
<br/>in regular procession, two and two, reached the central nave
<br/>where they separated into two files, one on each side of it. Ad
<br/>vancing in this order, marshalled by officers with scarfs of red and
<br/>yellow, the colours of Treves, they travelled the whole length of
<br/>the choir, and arrived at its upper end, where the two files again
<br/>united at the foot of an elevated platform of variegated marble, as-
<br/>cended on each side by a broad flight of steps, and decorated for
<br/>the occasion with flowering plants. In the centre of this platform
<br/>directly in front of the treasure chamber, from which it had been
<br/>taken, was displayed the revered object of their pilgrimage, spread
<br/>out on a glass case, and decked with white satin and blue drapery
<br/>trimmed with gold. The people mounted the platform by the
<br/>right-hand staircase, and passed in front of the relic, where they
<br/>were permitted to pause for an instant, while they gave to one of<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>the attending priests some small object, such as a medal, a rosary,
<br/>or a representation of the Robe, embroidered on silk, or engraved
<br/>on paper. The priest touched these to the Tunic, and having
<br/>thus, in the opinion of the orthodox, extracted some of its virtues
<br/>restored them to their owners, who then descended the flight of
<br/>steps on the left, and quitted the Cathedral by a side door. Upon
<br/>a table were seen the offerings of the pilgrims, an immense pile of
<br/>copper coins, testifying at once to the multitude of the donors and
<br/>to their individual poverty.	</p>
              <p>I am not ashamed to confess that, as I stood upon this elevation,
<br/>and surveyed the whole scene which was passing, I felt deeply
<br/>moved. The spectacle which the interior of that venerable edi-
<br/>fice then presented might indeed excuse a moment’s credulity.
<br/>On one side the pilgrims were pressing forward with faces of
<br/>eager expectation, chastened by religious awe, while the solemn
<br/>melody of the organ conspired to elevate the thoughts all from
<br/>earth; and as they descended, it was easy to read on their coun-
<br/>tenances the joy and gratitude with which they were filled.</p>
              <p>The Roman Catholics seize eagerly on examples of the emotion
<br/>which so impressive a ceremony can hardly fail to excite, as proofs
<br/>of a peculiar and divine influence which the relic exerts on the
<br/>stubborn hearts of heretics. A chronicler of the exposition relates,
<br/>for instance, with considerable naivete, that an Israelitish woman,
<br/>on seeing it, burst into tears, and immediately made an offering of
<br/>four thalers, which, in his opinion, is a very strong testimony to
<br/>the authenticity and virtue of the Robe.”</p>
              <p>There are a few more pages, but properly, the pilgrimage
<br/>ends here.</p>

<br/>by J. Fennimore Cooper. In 2 vols. New-York: Burgess,
<br/>Stringer &amp; Co.</p>
                <p>Satanstoe appears to be the first of a series of three tales
<br/>written to illustrate a principle, the principle of anti-rentism,
<br/>which Mr. Cooper considers a greater disgrace to the State of
<br/>New-York than repudiation to Mississippi. We have but lit-
<br/>tle faith in stories that are written to illustrate any other prin-
<br/>ciple than the principle of human nature, and we doubt wheth-
<br/>er Satanstoe will be read with much interest by any class ex-
<br/>cepting those who have read the author’s other productions, for
<br/>the sake of the story. It appears that Satanstoe is a neck of
<br/>land somewhere in Westchester county, its precise locality we
<br/>are not acquainted with, but it is probably in the neighborhood
<br/>of Devilshoof. Of the merits of the work we are unable to
<br/>speak at present. We give the concluding paragraph of the
<br/>author’s preface, for the sake of its manly tone, which wil
<br/>neet with a hearty response from all honest men.</p>
                <p>" For ourselves, we conceive that true patriotism consists in
<br/>laying bare every thing like public vice, and in calling things
<br/>by their right names. The great enemy of the race has made
<br/>a deep inroad upon us, within the list ten or a dozen years,
<br/>under cover of a spurious delicacy on the subject of expressing
<br/>national ills ; and it is time that they who have not been afraid
<br/>to praise when praise was merited, should not shrink from the
<br/>office of censuring, when the want of timely warnings may be
<br/>one cause of the most fatal evils. The great practical defect
<br/>of institutions like ours, is the circumstance that “ what is
<br/>everybody’s business, is nobody’s business,” a neglect that
<br/>gives to the activity of the rogue a very dangerous ascenden-
<br/>cy over the more dilatory corrections of the honest man.”</p>

<br/>It is by no means as good a book as we have a right to expect
<br/>from the author of “ The Mysteries of Paris;” its interest has
<br/>been materially impaired by too close an adherence to his-
<br/>torical fact. The chief actors are two young girls, nobly
<br/>born, and each of an heroic devotion beautifully diverse in
<br/>character; a youth of great sensitiveness and timidity; a
<br/>cynical and brutal giant and buffoon ; a nobleman of the gay
<br/>Court of Louis XIV; and an eccentric Dutch philosopher,
<br/>of great genius and erudition.</p>

<br/>By J. Hall Wright, author of “ Breakfast-table Scenes.” (Sci-
<br/>ence.) New York, Appleton &amp; Co.</p>
                <p>This neat little book is one of the second series of “ Tales
<br/>for the People and their children,” and in our estimation is
<br/>one of the best among them. A little more science and a lit-
<br/>tle less prattle would have greatly enhanced its value as a
<br/>book for the people, but even in its present shape it contains
<br/>a great amount of knowledge in a very limited space.</p>

            <p>We have received the first number of three new weekly
<br/>Magazines during the past week. Two of them sprung up in
<br/>Boston, and one in New-York. The most important of these
<br/>new comers, in appearance, and doubtless containing the largest
<br/>amount of vitality, is called “ The Harbinger ;” it is dedicated
<br/>to “ Social and Political Progress.” No editor is named, but
<br/>it is to be furnished with matter by Park Godwin, W. H.
<br/>Channing, Albert Brisbane, Osborne Macdanniel, Horace
<br/>Greely, George Ripley, Charles A. Dana, John S. Dwight, L.
<br/>W. Ryckman, John Allen, and Francis S. Shaw. Some of
<br/>these gentlemen we know to be matter-full men, and if they
<br/>lend their aid to this new magazine, it must shortly become an
<br/>important organ in the world of journalism. It emanates from
<br/>the Brook Farm Association at West Roxbury, and is, as a
<br/>matter of course, an advocate of Fourierism. The first num-
<br/>ber contains the beginning of George Sand’s famous story
<br/>“ Consuelo,” translated, we suppose, by F. S. Shaw, as the
<br/>copy-right is secured to him. The Harbinger is as well printed
<br/>as any paper of its class, but coming from an Association like
<br/>that at Brook Farm, we expected a greater degree of elegance
<br/>in its externals. Tuttle &amp; Dexter are the general agents.</p>
              <p>“The Jester,” is another Boston birth; an imitation of
<br/>Punch, but a very slender imitation indeed. The illustrations
<br/>are better than the matter illustrated, an unusual case in an
<br/>American publication. It wants a Lemon to give it flavor.</p>
              <p>“ The New-Yorker,” a semi-monthly paper of eight pages,
<br/>devoted to Temperance, Morality, and several other good
<br/>things, is published in New-York.</p>

                <p>We have seen a proof impression of an engraving by Smillie
<br/>and Hinshelwood, intended for part five of Martin’s edition of
<br/>the Bible, which will reflect great credit upon the skill of the
<br/>artists and the liberality of the publishers. The subject is the
<br/>“ departure of the Israelites” from a picture by David Roberts,
<br/>one of the best painters of Eastern life and scenery now liv-
<br/>ing. This picture has much of the grandeur of feeling pecu-
<br/>liar to Martin's designs, and though but a few inches in size,
<br/>is capable of creating as sublime and lofty emotions, as though
<br/>it were stretched over an acre of canvass. The cheapness of
<br/>illustrated books is a growing marvel. This print is of a class
<br/>rarely sold at a price less than two dollars, yet it is here given
<br/>away to the purchaser of one of the parts of the superb work
<br/>which it is meant to illustrate.</p>
                <p>We have before us, also, parts 29 and 30 of Harper's Bible,
<br/>which is more legitimately ornamented by wood-cuts, containing
<br/>an amount of pictorial illustrations, which, a few years ago, would
<br/>have been considered an impossibility at the price for which
<br/>they are now sold. The great defect of the illustrations of
<br/>“ Harper’s Bible,” arises from their sameness of character.
<br/>One author may well be illustrated by one artist; but to give
<br/>all the Prophets, Psalmists, and Evangelists of the Sacred
<br/>Book, into the hands of the same man for illustration, was a very
<br/>dangerous experiment. To fulfil such a task properly, as the
<br/>illustration of the whole Bible, requires an amount of genius
<br/>and learning, which no individual ever did, or ever can, possess.
<br/>If the Bible itself were pervaded by one tone of expression,
<br/>it would be the most wearisome book in existence. But one
<br/>of the charms which attracts all readers, is the almost infinite<div class="pagebreak" id="#page397"/>
                  <br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>variety of styles in which it is written. The Harpers’ edition,
<br/>however, has claims to favor irrespective of its illustrations,
<br/>which would render it a cheap and valuable work, even though
<br/>it did not contain a tenth part of its pictures. The type, pa-
<br/>per and ink, the correctness of the text and notes, are the
<br/>points which must give it a permanent and reliable value.</p>

                <p>Mr. E. L. Carey.—Philadelphia and the whole circle of
<br/>American artists, have met with a great loss in the death of
<br/>Mr. E. L. Carey, who had been an invalid for the last three
<br/>years, but was at last suddenly snatched away from his sphere
<br/>of usefulness, after an illness of only two days. Mr. Carey
<br/>was the most liberal and discriminating purchaser of works of
<br/>art in the country, and he had made the very best, if not the
<br/>most extensive collection of the productions of modern artists,
<br/>to be found in the Union. Mr. Carey was peculiarly liberal
<br/>towards young artists, and gave them orders without waiting
<br/>for them to become famous. The destruction of the Pennsyl-
<br/>vania Academy of Fine Arts is a calamity, no doubt; but it is
<br/>one that can be repaired ; the loss of an enlightened and lib-
<br/>eral patron, however, is one that the world of art cannot
<br/>repair. We trust, however, that Mr. Carey’s example will not 
<br/>be lost on the men of wealth in Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Horace Kneeland.—We are happy to learn that this de-
<br/>serving artist has received a very liberal order from a few gen-
<br/>tlemen of this City, Philadelphia and Boston, for another
<br/>equestrian statue of Washington, which is to be cast in bronze.
<br/>The model will be made here, but it will be taken to Berlin by 
<br/>Mr. Kneeland and there cast. The commission for this statue 
<br/>reflects the highest credit upon Mr. Kneeland’s past works,
<br/>and is an honor to the discernment and liberality of the gentle- 
<br/>men who have commissioned him. It also reflects disgrace, 
<br/>which the whole country should see, on the National Academy,
<br/>which recently refused to confer the poor title of associate 
<br/>upon Mr. K., who has, during the past four years, exhibited
<br/>the first busts in the annual exhibitions of the Academy, if we 
<br/>except those by Mr. Powers. But while there are so many
<br/>spoilers of canvass among the academicians, it can hardly be 
<br/>expected that they should admit an artist of respectable abilities
<br/>among their associates. In justice to the Academy, it should
<br/>be known that the best artists belonging to it were in favor of
<br/>Mr. Kneeland’s election.</p>

                <p>New York Philharmonic Society vs. the Musical
<br/>Fund Society of Philadelphia.—It seems that some per- 
<br/>son corresponding with the Mirror, from Philadelphia, takes 
<br/>the opportunity of speaking of the Musical Fund in terms of
<br/>high commendation, while he does considerable, although per-
<br/>haps unintentional injustice to the Philharmonic Society. 
<br/>This Society, although by no means a benefit society, accord- 
<br/>ing to its constitution, has yet taken a noble stand in the cause
<br/>of humanity. We know of several instances where the funds
<br/>have been judiciously applied, either to aid the sick, or to bury 
<br/>the deceased brother. There is no party feeling here ; all is
<br/>forgotten but the necessity of the case. A member of the N.
<br/>Y. P. S., in answer to the Mirror, states that the remunera-
<br/>tion of the members, barely amounts to one dollar for their at-<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/> 
                  <br/>tendence at the numerous rehearsals which occur during the
<br/>season.</p>
               <p>This is indeed poor pay for two or three hours’ tedious re-
<br/>hearsals during each week. It is indeed so poor that nothing
<br/>but the right spirit of enthusiasm for their profession can in-
<br/>duce the members to submit to such a loss.</p>
                <p>For loving their art so well they should be commended and
<br/>respected, but there are other points which entitle them, in
<br/>our opinion, to still higher commendation and respect. Why
<br/>is it that their dividend is so small—why is it that they have to
<br/>work so hard for a remuneration so inadequate ? The Socie-
<br/>ty is successful ! it is prosperous in the highest degree—the
<br/>favorite with the profession and the public ! What then is the
<br/>reason of its apparent poverty—it is that they all must willing-
<br/>ly yield the greater portion of the results of their hard labor for
<br/>the sake of a charity which is wide and embracing. Besides
<br/>this, many of the members are liberal subscribers to the con-
<br/>certs, for their families and their friends, and in this way con-
<br/>tribute individually to the prosperity of the society. We know
<br/>some, who instead of receiving any dividend from the receipts,
<br/>were by their liberal subscriptions indebted to the society.</p>
                <p>The Philharmonic Society deserve more credit for their lib-
<br/>erality, from the fact that they pretend to nothing, but do all
<br/>that charity requires in a sure but secret, unostentatious man-
<br/>ner.</p>
                <p>We have long known the necessity of a fund which should
<br/>be devoted to the relief of indigent or aged musicians, and we
<br/>trust that at no distant period an institution so much needed
<br/>and so charitable in its purposes will be established ; but in the
<br/>meantime we assure our friends in Philadelphia, that the sick
<br/>or the needy musician, is not entirely friendless, and cannot be,
<br/>while the Philharmonic Society continues to extend its bene-
<br/>ficial influence over the profession of New York.</p>

               <div class="head">Mr. Fry, --his Critics and his Friends</div>
                <p>Mr. Fry,—his Critics and his Friends.—Our remarks
<br/>upon Mr. Fry’s Leonora have called forth a lengthy reply in
<br/>the Evening Express.</p>
                <p>The reply is of very little moment, as nothing we have said
<br/>is therein refuted ; indeed, the only attempt at refutation is in
<br/>the case of Newkomn’s fine song, King Death, and in this the
<br/>writer has signally failed, as we shall show. The writer of
<br/>the Express first quotes our words—</p>
                <p>“ Montalvo’s first song is ‘ King Death was a rare old fellow.'
<br/>This song as composed by Chevalier Newkomn is universally
<br/>known, and what could have induced Mr. Fry to introduce it into
<br/>his Opera, unless to suggest comparison, we are at a loss to con-
<br/>ceive. Comparisons will be drawn, and to his disadvantage, for
<br/>the first phrases of his version prove, beyond a doubt, that New-
<br/>komn’s fine song was fresh in his memory, and suggested, if not
<br/>supplied the thoughts.”</p>
                <p>He then adds:</p>
                <p>" Now, it so happens that Mr. Fry’s version of the song has been
<br/>lying for years in his repertoire, and was sung in public and in
<br/>private—(just as it is bodily introduced into ‘ Leonora,’ and per-
<br/>formed by Mr. Seguin,) when Barry Cornwall's words were new,
<br/>and probably long before the Chev. Newkomn ever thought of
<br/>setting.”</p>
                <p>Now, we don’t pretend to doubt the truth of the assertion
<br/>that Mr. Fry’s version has been lying in his repertoire for
<br/>years, for the original is old enough to allow of it; we remem-
<br/>ber it some twelve or fourteen years. With regard to the “ pro-
<br/>bability” that Mr. Fry set the words before Newkomn saw
<br/>them, we positively state that there is not a shadow of a possi-
<br/>bility that such should be the case, for it is a well-known fact
<br/>that Barry Cornwall, or Proctor, wrote the words one morning
<br/>while Newkomn was with him, and that the Chevalier compos-
<br/>ed the music to them, as it was afterwards published, before
<br/>he left the room. The two artists were on terms of the most
<br/>intimate friendship, and Barry Cornwall wrote all his lyrics<div class="pagebreak" id="#page398"/>
                  <br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>especially for Newkomm, because, as he said, a foreigner ap-
<br/>preciated them, and discovered their musical adaptability, when
<br/>his own countrymen passed them by unnoticed. Mr. Fry, or
<br/>his friends, may still claim priority, originality, &amp;c. &amp;c., but
<br/>the fact as we have stated it cannot be disputed.</p>
                <p>The editor of the Express refers with excessive satisfaction
<br/>to a long, tumid, fulsomely laudatory article which appeared in
<br/>the Express on the 9th inst. ; and which he flatteringly denomi-
<br/>nates a criticism, comparing it triumphantly with our notice of
<br/>the Opera. It will be seen by the following quotation that he
<br/>considers the relative value and truth of the two articles to
<br/>be determined by the corrections of our statement respecting
<br/>“ King Death.”</p>
                <p>“ Now, after this opera of ‘ Leonora’ had been played four times
<br/>we published in this paper an extended criticism of it from the
<br/>pen of one of the best and most impartial musical judges in this
<br/>country. His favorable judgment of the composition and its per-
<br/>formance have been corroborated by other writers equally un-
<br/>prejudiced, and equally experienced. The ‘ Broadway Journal,’
<br/>on the other hand, has this elaborate condemnation of the opera;
<br/>and now, who is to decide which of all these critics is right ?
<br/>Which is best entitled to public confidence, as to the merits of the
<br/>composition in question ? We take leave to say that the paragraph
<br/>above quoted ought to settle the dispute definitely, so far as the
<br/>authenticity of the Journal’s infallibility is concerned, at least."</p>
                <p>We are content to leave “ the authenticity of the Journal’s
<br/>infallibility,” to be decided by the truth or the contrary of our
<br/>statement.	</p>
                <p>Our criticism throughout was a fair and impartial one, and
<br/>has placed Mr. Fry in his true position as an imitator and not
<br/>a creator. His blind idolatry of the modern Italian school,
<br/>has led him to think not merely similarities, but positive iden-
<br/>tities. He may believe honestly that they are original; his
<br/>friends and such writers as the one in the Express, may con-
<br/>firm him in the belief, but we assure him and them that the
<br/>whole is a delusion. Any honest and competent writer would
<br/>scorn to toady the individual at the expense of the art! What
<br/>man possessing any knowledge of music, or respect for truth
<br/>after hearing Leonora, with its endless robberies from Bellini
<br/>&amp; Co., could sit down and pen so wilful and absurd a false-
<br/>hood as the following from the critique in the Express—“ As
<br/>we said in a former article, he takes rank by this work with
<br/>the first of living masters.” Is this writer aware of the ex-
<br/>istence of Rossini ? of Auber ? or even of those trifling writers
<br/>Mendelssohn, Spohr, Beissiger, Marschner, Meyerbeer, and a
<br/>hundred other writers, the least of them enjoying a sterling
<br/>reputation from their published works, by far exceeding the
<br/>written-up-by-my-brother’s-reputation of Mr. Fry.</p>
                <p>Again, says this writer, “ He has achieved that which no
<br/>man speaking the English language has yet equalled.” What
<br/>bombast ! what fustian ! Handel spoke the English language
<br/>fluently, Weber also, and Oberon was the result; Ferdninand
<br/>Reiss too, and the Ice Witch was the consequence,—the Ice
<br/>Witch was by the by, composed in six weeks, so that Reiss
<br/>beat Fry by six weeks;—Jules Benedict may be said to have
<br/>advanced beyond the rudiments of the English language, and
<br/>his Operas of the Gipsey’s Warning, and the Bride of Venice
<br/>are still extant. Then we have John Barnett, Edward Loder,
<br/>Mcfarren, Balfe, and even Rooke, who speak English, though,
<br/>some of them are Irish to be sure, and each of these has done
<br/>more to win a lasting reputation than Mr. Fry in his Leonora
<br/>gives evidence of being capable of doing. They have not
<br/>before, certainly, contrived the monstrosity of a recitative
<br/>Opera; but there is one man who had the audacity and the
<br/>misfortune to live before Mr. Fry, we mean Dr. Arne who
<br/>wrote the recitative Opera of Artaxerxes. We will not draw
<br/>a comparison between the two works, lest we should be con-
<br/>sidered partial; but we doubt if Leonora will live to as good
<br/>an old age as the venerable Artaxerxes.</p>

<br/> writer in the Express calls the writer in the Express for we
<br/>believe that both the critique and the criticism upon our criti-
<br/>cism, own the same paternity—we had almost said fry-ternity
<br/>—the “ best and most impartial of musical judges,” we say—
<br/>as the Express says—must be a very ignorant pretender in
<br/>the art which he professes to criticise. A more uncouth jum-
<br/>ble of unmeaning phrases will seldom be found huddled together
<br/>in one article. He has, however, found out one great, origi-
<br/>nal and peculiar beauty in Leonora, for which Mr. Fry certain-
<br/>ly owes him one; we find it described in two places, in the
<br/>following words:—“ The finale follows, introduced with a short
<br/>passage by the Chorus fortissimo on a high key." “ The end
<br/>of the finale is in syncopated passages on high keys for the
<br/>whole Chorus.” Good gracious! which are the high keys ?
<br/>—and if it be not an impertinent question, did the whole of the
<br/>Chorus sing in different high keys ? this is an important query,
<br/>and we should be glad to send its solution to Europe, as the
<br/>effect of vast bodies in high keys—the Irish already have high-
<br/>lowes—may become a standard of its class !!</p>
                <p>There are many absurdities equally glaring, which we will
reserve for a future article.</p>

<br/>SECOND EDITION.—This valuable work is being introduced
<br/>into a large number of the best Schools in the City and
<br/>Country.
<br/>It only needs to be generally known to become universally
<br/>established.
<br/>Testimonials are received from every quarter.
<br/>From Rev. R. F. Burnham, Rector of St. Paul’s Church, Hoboken.
<br/>“ Having seen, with much pleasure, a second edition, by your
<br/>house, of “ A Plain System of Elocution,” I beg leave to express
<br/>to you my opinion of the high merit of that work.
<br/>Its title is in keeping with the plan pursued in the book ; a rare
<br/>fact in this age of making many books. In the work may be found
<br/>what this age needs—a System of Elocution, that presents to the
<br/>learner something tangible; and that combines meaning with
<br/>beauty, and beauty with force.
<br/>I hereby express the opinion that the Principals of Seminaries
<br/>of Learning would benefit the department of Elocution, by the
<br/>introduction of Mr. Vandenhoff’s System.”

<br/>NO.’S XI AND XII OF THE LIBRARY OF CHOICE
<br/>READING, Containing the Crescent and the Cross, by Eliot War-
<br/>burton, Esq. Two thick parts, 12mo. beautifully printed in large clear
<br/>type, on fine white paper, each 50 cts.
<br/>“ Eliot Warburton, who is known to be the author of these brilliantly
<br/>sparkling papers, the “ Episodes of Eastern Travel,” which lit up our
<br/>last November. His book (The Crescent and the Cross) must and will
<br/>be capital.”—Vide “ Eothen,” page 179.
<br/>“This delightful work is, from first to last, a splendid panorama of
<br/>Eastern scenery, in the full blaze of its magnificence. The crowning
<br/>merit of the book is, that it is evidently the production of a gentleman,
<br/>and a man of the world, who has lived in the best society, and been an
<br/>attentive observer of the scenes and characters which have passed before
<br/>him during his restless and joyous existence. To a keen sense of the
<br/>ludicrous, he joins a power of sketching and grouping which are happily
<br/>demonstrated.”—Morning Post.
<br/>“ We could not recommend a better book as a travelling companion
<br/>than Mr. Warburton’s. Admirably written as is the work, and eminent-
<br/>ly graphic as are its descriptions, it possesses a yet more exalted merit
<br/>in the biblical and philosophical illustrations of the writer.”—United
<br/>Service Magazine.
<br/>“ Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The
<br/>' Realities’ of ' Eastern Travel’ are described with a vividness which in-
<br/>vest them with deep and abiding interest; while the ‘Romantic’ ad-
<br/>ventures which the enterprising tourist met with in his course are
<br/>narrated with a spirit which shows how much he enjoyed these reliefs
<br/>from the ennui ot every-day life.”—Globe.

<br/>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he
<br/>has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old estab-
<br/>lishment in Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS
<br/>published on the continent without the heavy expense attending their
<br/>transmission through England. Each of these establishments will be
<br/>conducted by one of his sons, under his own general superintendence.—
<br/>This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage to his
<br/>correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
<br/>on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and
<br/>small sums payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New-York. Two and a

<br/>literature or science. For information in regard to his efficiency, he
<br/>begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other lit-

<br/>to devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits, his greatest plea-
<br/>sure will arise from sending rare and valuable books to his own country;
<br/>and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States a Library
<br/>which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
<br/>he can live to say, “ I ALso assisted IN its formation,” his most ar-
<br/>dent wishes will be gratified.
<br/>Mr. Rich has in press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova: a Cata-

            <div class="ab">BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
<br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
<br/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this
<br/>method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<br/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises,
<br/>scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they enlist
<br/>the interests of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those
<br/>mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often made irksome in
<br/>other instruction books. The time has arrived when a superficial know-
<br/>ledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of
<br/>such methods as Bertini's that pupils will he enabled to Read music
<br/>with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
<br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
<br/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
<br/>lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
<br/>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from
<br/>professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini's
<br/>Method over all others yet published in this country, most of them
<br/>having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to
<br/>give a few of the names in the principal cities.
