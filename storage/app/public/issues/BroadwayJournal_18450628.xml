         <div class="ab">RELATED BY HIMSELF.</div>
         
         <div class="ab">(Continued.)</div>
         
         <p>The Franklin Coffee House, though very far from being a
            Todgerses, is patronized only by commercial gentlemen, who
            either live “up town,” or lodge in their stores. They are
            early diners of course, and I found the coffee-room almost deeerted, for it was past five when I entered. One or two Birmingham and Manchester agents, gentleman who deal in fishhooks and spool-cotton, were finishing their dinners with
            brandy and water, and a bit of cheese and a tart. I was quite 
            appalled at the looks of the waiter, who seemed to say; “indeed, sir, you don’t think of axing for dinner at this time o’day ?”
            With a half eagle in my pocket, I would not have cared a copper for their impertinent looks, but it struck me that it would
            be regarded as a very suspicious circumstance to ask for credit
            at that unseasonable hour, and I perceived on glancing my eye
            towards the bar that my friend, the fat proprietor was absent.
            My appetite had been sharpened to the extremest point of endurance by a peep at the larder, but I was yet able to preserve
            something like self-respect. I will not forfeit my honor, I
            said, if I starve for it; and then an idea popped into my head, 
            which must have been striving a long while for entrance; it
            was the most unaccountable thing in the world, that I should
            never once have thought of going in pursuit of the cab-driver 
            to recover my half eagle. I started on the instant, forgetting 
            in my hurry the cravings of my stomach, and just as I was 
            turning the corner of Nassau street, I heard somebody call 
            me by name. Looking round I perceived my friend Skillet, 
            in a Rockaway waggon.
         </p>
         
         <p>“How are you, F.,” said Skillet, checking his horse.</p>
         
         <p>“Very well,” I replied, “but don’t stop me, I am half dead.”</p> 
         
         <p>“Are you so, then jump into my waggon and_let me give 
            you a lift.”
         </p>
         
         <p>This was kind, and although I preferred not being jostled 
            over the pavements in my condition, yet as I should get to the
            end of my journey the sooner for it, I accepted of his invitation. 
         </p>
         
         <p>“Now, F.,” said Skillet, “you have often promised to call 
            upon Mrs. Skillet, but you never have done so. Come, go
            home with me and take a cup of tea. I live in Seventieth street, 
            and I will send you home at nine.”
         </p>
         
         <p>A cup of tea to a man in my situation!</p>
         
         <p>“By the way, what have you got in that basket which I saw 
            hanging under your waggon ?"
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nothing, but a smoked salmon and some radishes;” replied Skillet.</p>	
         
         <p>Smoked salmon and radishes, bread and butter, cakes, preserved fruits, strawberries and cream, a cup of delicious young 
            hyson, and perhaps something else, flashed through my thoughts. 
         </p>
         
         <p>“I will go upon one condition,” I said.</p>
         
         <p>“Name it, name it;" said Skillet.</p>
         
         <p>“That you give me some of that salmon for my supper.”</p> 
         
         <p>“Agreed. Jump in.”</p>
         
         <p>Accordingly, I did jump in—to the fire, out of the frying- 
            pan in which I was suffering at the time	
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         <p>Skillet kept talking to me all the way about his business,
            his importations, sales and losses; but I could understand
            nothing that he said, my thoughts were so busy with the smoked salmon. I had no intention of letting this trifling supper at
            Skillet’s go for a dinner. No. The dinner I would have the
             next day, and so I meant to just blunt the edge of my appetite
            on salmon and so forth, and satisfy myself, with a good hearty
            dinner of the most recherche description, at three o’clock pre cisely the next day. I could not wait until five. And then,
            such a dinner as I would eat, should be a caution to a French
             cook! In the meantime a good meal of broiled salmon, with
            other little delicacies, might well pass as a substitute for a
             dinner, with a person of my moderate desires. The cottage
            of my friend Skillet was in 70th street, near the Hudson, and
            quite a distance from any other dwelling. He called it an
            English cottage, but for what reason I never could learn. It
            was a little bit of a Greek temple with Venetian blinds in the
            place of triglyphs, and two Gothic chimneys in the centre. I
            had never dined with Skillet, for I had heard that his wife was
            one of those nuisances in a man’s house, who gives his friends
            unequivocal intimation that she only tolerates them because
            she must. But Skillet, who ought to know what sort of a
            person he has got for a help-meet, should not make his friends
            partakers of his own misery, by inviting them to his house. It
             is neither generous nor humane.
         </p>
         
         <p> Skillet’s horse was a good traveller, and we reached his
             cottage in very good season. The jostling over the pavements
            had rather increased my appetite, and made me anxious to
             learn whether the salmon was a large one or not.
         </p>
         
         <p>Skillet jumped out first and immediately exclaimed, “F., I
            am ruined! The basket is gone.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Not the basket with the salmon, surely,” I said, “it can’t
            be possible.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Yes, upon my soul,” said Skillet, deliberately, “the string
            by which it was fastened broke, and I suppose some hod-carrier
            will eat it for his supper. However, we will give you something in the place of it. Mrs. Skillet has got supper on the
            table I dare say.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We walked into the cottage and I was introduced to Mrs.
            Skillet. What could have induced the man to marry such a
            woman! Mrs. S. was a —-. But I will not waste words
            upon such an icicle. An icicle! Let me recall the simile.
            An icicle will melt, but nothing could melt such a dry stick as
            Mrs. Skillet. One thing I will say of her; she kept her house
            like wax-work, as the vulgar say. It was curiously clean, and
            glossy. The tea-table was spread in the hall, a rather capacious one with a straw carpet on the floor, very cool and pleasant. I would not, or rather I dared not trust myself to look at
            the table, lest I should be tempted to commit some impropriety.
            Skillet showed me his library, consisting almost entirely of
            new works and illustrated Bibles, for he was fond of light
            reading and his wife was pious; he then took me into his garden and gave me the history of all his vegetables, besides
            telling me a long story about a grape vine which some people
            called a scuppernong, and others a golden chasselas. All this
            time I was in the greatest impatience conceivable, thinking of
            the supper and trying to get a scent of something broiling.
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page402"></div>
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>Even after the servant had summoned us to tea, Skillet insisted that I should stop and examine his dahlias which were only 
            a foot above ground. At last we went into the house and
            found Mrs. Skillet at the table. The prospect was dreadful,
            but there was something to hope for, a covered dish in the
            centre of the table might contain, oysters—mutton chops—
            warm or cold chicken—anything that was good and solid, although, from its size it could not contain much of anything let it
            be what it would. Besides the covered dish there was nothing upon the table but a few slices of bread, a plate of dry
            rusk, a butter plate and the tea equipage, as Skillet called it. 
            How could a gentleman and a Christian set a hungry friend 
            down to such a table. However, I do not blame Skillet; the 
            fault was his wife’s. But slender as the prospect seemed, I 
            was in a hurry to realize some of the promises before me.
            Mrs. Skillet must prolong my sufferings by asking a blessing.
            And then with a most unthankful look she asked me if I took
            sugar and cream in my tea. I took both, of course, but the
            cream was a thin bluish substance, that resembled milk and
            water, and she poured it out of the cream-jug in a little slender
            stream as though it were some precious essence. Skillet
            reached the bread and I caught two slices and they were gone
            in a moment, and then I took two more and the plate was
            empty. Mrs. S. looked amazed and called for more bread.
            The centre dish still remained covered and my eyes were
            fixed intently upon it, which Skillet perceived and said, “my
            dear, what have you got here ?" he raised the cover, and, what
            do you think was revealed to my longing sight ? But you
            never could think.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was a dish of red currants!</p>
         
         <p>I must have shown my disappointment, for Skillet himself
            blushed, and looking up said, “perhaps you would like a relish
            of some kind ?”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Well, to tell the truth, I would,” I replied.</p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Skillet said she believed there was some cold mutton in
            the pantry, and ordered Bridget to bring it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cold mutton! I think I never listened to two words which
            fell so pleasantly upon my hearing. Cold mutton! There
            must be a leg, or a breast, at least. I am not only fond of
            mutton, but I am particularly fond of it cold; perhaps she will
            bring a pickle and mustard with it, who knows. And I think
            I could eat even a cold potatoe with a relish. These thoughts
            and many more flitted through my mind while Bridget was
            gone. By and by I heard her approaching, I looked up as
            she entered and there was nothing in her hand. The cat had
            got into the pantry and eaten the mutton.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, well,” said Skillet, “I will kill that cat if I live to
            catch her.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It’s of no consequence, my dear,” said his wife, “there 
            was but little of it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>I had now no hopes of anything, and I ate two or three
            more slices of bread and butter and a rusk which only set my
            appetite sharper. The tea was good. I will give Mrs. Skillet credit for that. As for the currants, I didn’t touch them.
         </p>
         
         <p>Perhaps I am violating the rights of hospitality in thus exposing the economy of my friend's table, but it appears to me
            that it is one of those cases that require exposure. If a man
            will impose upon his friends he should be made an example of.
            To think of setting a dry rusk and a saucer of currants before
            me, who had eaten nothing in twenty-four hours. However,
            a dinner, and a good one too I was determined to have; no
            supper, nor breakfast would satisfy me, else I would have
            gone directly from Skillet’s to Florence's or Downing's, and
            gorged myself with oysters or lobsters, or something of that
            kind. Skillet perceived that I was discontented about something, although, I am not sure that he understood the right
            cave, and proposed taking me home. I was glad enough to 
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>go, and as we rode into town, although the night was extremely dark I kept a sharp look-out for the lost basket with
            the salmon, determined, if we found it, to make Skillet go back
            and have some broiled for my supper, but we did not find it,
            and after I reached home I bade my friend good night in a
            very ill-tempered mood.
         </p>
         
         <p>Suddenly I encountered my two old chums, the best fellows
            in the world and my very dearest friends S. and L. They had
            just arrived from Boston, and, like myself, were as hungry as
            a cross-cut saw. “Come, go with us and get some oysters,”
            said L.
         </p>
         
         <p>“No,” I replied, “I am saving my appetite for dinner to-
            morrow.”
         </p>
         
         <p>They both laughed vociferously at my answer, and taking
            hold of my arms, said “that I should go with them.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well,” said I, “my friends, I will go with you, but I will
            eat none of your oysters. But If you are disposed to treat
            me, I will eat a piece of smoked salmon.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Smoked salmon!” exclaimed both together; “have you
            lost your senses, F. ?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Almost,” I said, “but they have been wandering after a
            bit of smoked salmon.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Here, the merry creatures broke into a boisterous laugh
            again, and the next moment I found myself in a cellar; where
            there was a crowd of people intently occupied in swallowing
            oysters. The place was .new to me, but it seemed like an old
            establishment, for the tables and chairs were ricketty, the walls
            were black with smoke, and the waiters were gray headed
            negroes; the only sounds heard were the grating of the oyster
            knives, and the constant smack of the lips among the oyster
            eaters. There were no flaunting red curtains, no gilding, no
            salacious paintings, no ornaments of any kind about the place.
            It was simply an oyster cellar, so dark and damp that the bivalves might have fancied themselves in their native mud, until
            roused from their delusion by the prick of the oyster-knife.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come,” said L., “give your order,” and as he said it he
            winked at S., as though there was some secret understanding
            between them.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Bring me,” said S., “two dozen of Shrewsburys in the
            shell, a French roll, a lemon, some butter, a plate of watercresses, and the least drop in the world of Seignette with a
            lump of ice.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ditto for me,” said L., “and don’t forget a napkin.”</p>
         
         <p>The waiter was about to disappear when I said, “you forget
            me, my friends.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“O, a tooth-pick for F.,” said L., calling the waiter back.</p>
         
         <p>“No, not a tooth-pick, but a bit of salmon broiled,” I ex-
            claimed, while the sweat began to start from every pore.
         </p>
         
         <p>The next moment the Shrewsburys, the lemon, roll, butter,
            cresses, and so forth, were put upon the table and my two
            friends began to eat. O, it was a sight to see them suck in
            the oysters, while I sat with my mouth running like a Croton
            hydrant, and they not offering me an oyster. It is true that I
            had positively declined eating any, but still, as my salmon had
            not been brought, they might have said, “F., won’t you take
            an oyster!” I knew that I should have been welcome, but I
            had a strange delicacy of feeling about taking one without being invited.
         </p>
         
         <p>In a very short time the Shrewsburys had disappeared and
            nothing but the shells remained. My friends smacked their
            lips with infinite satisfaction, and directly the old white-headed
            negro re-appeared.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come,” said S., “give your order,” and he winked again
            at L."
         </p>
         
         <p>“Let me see,” said L., “shall we have the fried or broiled
            first?"
         </p>
         
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page403"></div>
         
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div> 
         <p>The broiled, the broiled, by all means,” said S.</p>
         
         <p>“Salmon, of course;" said I.</p>
         
         <p>“No, oysters;” said L. “Waiter, bring us two dozen of
            broiled oysters, let them be done to a turn, well buttered but
            not peppered, more French rolls, a head of fresh lettuce, and
            a small bottle of chateau Margaux.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ditto for me,” said S.</p>
         
         <p>“But, my friends,” said I, “you forget the salmon.”</p>

         <div class="head">BRITISH CRITICISMS ON AMERICAN ART.</div>
         
         <p>The late London papers contain several notices of American
            works of Art at present in that city. Among them we find the
            following on a portrait by Inman, in the Exhibition of the Royal
            Academy, which we have extracted from the Art-Union.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Portrait of Mrs. G. Putnam. H. Inman. This work is
            hung so high that it is difficult to distinguish its nicer qualities.
            The style is retiring, and the general color managed with much
            delicacy. Mr. Inman is the leading portrait painter of America, and merits the high fame he has recently obtained in his
            own country. He has recently visited England, where he has
            painted portraits of Chalmers, Wordsworth, and other ‘great
            men.’ These we have seen, and consider among the best
            works of modem art. There are, indeed, few of our own artists
            who could surpass them. The picture here exhibited may be
            good or may be bad; the hangers have left the matter at all
            events a question,”
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Doughty has a landscape in the exhibition of the Royal
            Academy, which, like Mr. Inman’s picture, is also hung out of
            sight. It is thus noticed in the Art-Union:
         </p>
         
         <p>“We are deprived of the power to inspect this picture from
            its being hung so high. All we can say is that the view seems
            to have been selected with judgment, and made the most of, as
            to general effect; and if it be as good as, or better than, productions of his pencil with which we are acquainted, it is a picture which ought, in common justice, to have been placed more
            on a level with the eye.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We have seen no notices of either of the other American
            pictures in the Exhibition. Probably they were hung so that
            they could not be seen at all. The Art-Union notices a picture
            by Howard, R. A., in the following terms: “Placed as this production is, upon the line, and in one of the most prominent situations in the best room, we feel called upon to speak of the
            work in terms of decided condemnation. Men who, like the
            contributors from Germany, Belgium and America, have been
            subjected to gross indignities by the British Royal Academy,
            will naturally institute comparisons between their degraded ‘ offerings’ and such lamentable exposing as this.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The “Greek Slave” by Powers, has been very generally
            praised by the London journals, and one of his female busts is
            pronounced by Mr. Titmarsh, in Frazer’s Magazine, to be the
            best one in the exhibition. The Art-Union says of the statue:
            “In a few words, we pay the artist the highest compliment that
            can be offered: it is insufficient to say that the work reminds us
            of the antique,—it competes successfully with the best remnants
            of Greek Art.” The criticism of the Athenaeum is more particular, but quite as flattering; it is the best that we have seen,
            and therefore we copy it, as it will give a very good idea of the
            work:
         </p>
         
         <p>“We have seen a statue, by an American artist, Mr. Hiram
            Powers, which its purchaser, Mr. Grant, has brought over from
            Florence; and, with the zeal of a generous patron, has sent
            for exhibition to the rooms of Mr. Graves, the print-seller in
            Pall Mall,—determined, as he declares, to make the public
            sharers in his admiration of the sculptor. Our readers may remember that Mrs. Trollope, in her ‘ Visit to Italy,’ gave some
            account of this artist,—whom she had fallen in with at Cincinnatti, a mere modeller of wax figures, and afterwards at Florence, in the flush of his ripened talent and an Italian fame.
            The work in question has in fact attracted a great deal of no
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>tice; and during the short period of its exhibition, Mr. Grant
            has, we understand, had several offers for its -purchase—the
            Duke of Southerland and the Marquis of Northampton having
            been named to us as among the parties who have been desirous
            to possess themselves of it. Its present proprietor, however,
            will dispose of it only to a public institution. With the National Gallery or the British Museum he is willing to treat, for
            the honor of the artist; but if the work is to be confined to a
            private gallery, he chooses that gallery to be his own. His determination has, however, done better for the sculptor than any
            transfer of the statue in question; it being understood that Mr.
            Grant, who is about to return to Florence, takes with him several commissions for the young American. The figure in question is certainly a very remarkable work,—and might be thought
            still more so as the work of an American, were it not remembered that the sculptor has been for ten or a dozen years past
            resident in Florence, where his genius has fed on the Greek
            inspiration, and outlived, it may be supposed, the chastening
            apprehension of the prudes at home.
         </p>
         
         <p>“The work represents a Greek Captive; and professes to embody a historical fact—the exposure of female slaves for sale in
            a Turkish bazaar, during one of the early Greek revolutions.
            The figure is entirely naked; and the nudity, in this case, is of
            a peculiarly daring character, exactly in as far as it is historical
            and not spontaneous—because, instead of being, like some of
            the finest figures of the same class, abstractions of loveliness,
            in which the sense of nakedness is subdued by the suggestion
            of privacy and the sentiment of utter unconsciousness,—the
            rich proportions are, in this instance, presented with a direct
            view to their voluptuous character and intention, and make the
            same appeal to the critic’s judgment of merely physical form,
            which they are supposed to be at the moment making in the
            sensualist’s market. There is no escaping from this aspect of
            the work; and the very sentiment of shame and disgust which
            mingles with the sorrow on the sweet face, only enforces that
            impression,—being a further and most expressive reference to
            the subject. It is a great mistake on the artist’s part to have
            placed his figure in such a predicament—to have chosen a story
            like this as the vehicle for an exhibition of its beauties; and in
            this view of it, it is an additional misfortune that the sculptor’s
            type of female form is a somewhat massive one—the mortal
            proportions submitted to no process of refining or idealizing.—
            The story, however, received as legitimate, is powerfully told.
            The character and sentiment of the situation are conveyed with
            a masterly hand. Nothing need surpass the ease and freedom
            of attitude and movement, or the simplicity of manner by
            which they are attained. The composition and modelling are
            of first rate excellence; the former so skilfully arranged, that
            no view of the figure can be taken which does not bring into
            combination many of the fine effects of the latter. There are
            parts of the execution, especially in the back of the figure, full
            of fine lines and beautiful hints—which exhibit a hand of high
            power. When we speak of the massive character of the
            beauty of this work, perhaps we should qualify the expression
            by some explanation of our meaning. If this figure be tested
            by some of the finest antiques, or by a work like Baily’s
            ‘ Nymph,’ now in the Academy, it should be born in mind that,
            in each of those, there is a selection of features and proportions
            —real and human in themselves, but combined and assorted,
            after the sculptor’s sense of beauty, into a shape which takes
            thus the character of the ideal. But this is a real woman—living and acting and suffering—flesh in its earthly proportions—a
            Greek slave—a figure which, in sentiment and form, may stand
            for the ‘ Ionian Myrrha;’ and it is modelled with a careful study
            and anatomical observance which some of our sculptors might
            do well to consult. The figure is wrought out of a beautiful
            block of Serravezza marble; and there are some of its muscular
            accidents which imitate the flesh in a manner quite marvellous
            for such a substance. The modem Greek costume is displayed
            on a column, on which the right hand of the Captive rests;
            and the Cross is there, to express her religion and country. The
            chains on the wrist are not historical, but used as accessories,
            and have a very clever application in the composition. We
            know not if the Transatlantic mind be sufficiently expanded out
            of its conventional proprieties, since Mrs. Trollope’s day, to receive a latitudinarian artist like Mr. Powers with the honors
            of ‘ a prophet in his own country;’—but certain it is, that, by
            his means, the Americans may boast of a sculptor in Europe.”

         <div class="head">CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A MOTHER AND GOVERNESS.</div>
         
         <p>My Dear Friend:—I am quite easy about my children, as
            they are left in your care, and my mind, free from anxiety, is
            open to any passing enjoyment which the state of my health
            allows me to partake. I took a drive of a few miles yesterday
            with my brother, whose conversation with all his variety of
            entertaining knowledge, made it very pleasant. I told him I
            intended, on my return, to furnish my garden with native plants,
            the shrubs as well as the small flowers, and among the rest,
            the cornet, but he says, though variety is good, the virburnam
            is more beautiful. He remarked also, that the species of sumach, that hears green flowers is the finest; but as the red
            flowers are prettier, he should like to have both. I took a
            walk by the brook, that runs through his farm, while he visited
            a patient who lives near. When he joined me, he said, his
            patient had consulted, formerly, an inefficient practitioner,
            whose doses were always too small. My brother says, when
            you hit the nail upon the head you should strike hard enough
            to drive it in. This man’s practice is, as if I should put a few
            grains of belladonna into this stream, and then tell my patients
            to come drink the water and be cured. I was much pleased
            with my ramble; the cardinal, monkey flower, and snakehead,
            were blooming by the brook, with a few lingering specimens
            of the elegant hybrid loose-strife. I had a glance at a distance of a marmot, eating the grass, and walking through the
            wood, where grew the splendid yellow gerardin; I saw the
            entrance to his subterraneous abode, in which he is as safe and
            secure as a nobleman in his castle. If the brute creation are
            not, as the Egyptians thought, proper objects of worship,
            watching their ways may well lead the thoughts to the Divinity.
            My brother visited another patient, who had not taken his
            medicines, and with just resentment he was going to abandon
            him, but I dissuaded him, as I thought if he did, it would distress the patient’s mother. My brother is unfortunate in having a very sickly wife, who is prohibited by ill health, from the
            activity, that would make her either happy in herself, or useful to others. I pity her for this, and also for the censures, to
            which she is subjected by not mixing with the world. Public
            opinion subjects her to the same ordeal the witches were liable
            to in old times, for she can prove herself in no way unequal to
            the common engagements of life, but by dying. She sometimes thinks that my brother had better followed in his choice
            the ideas of Aikin and Combe, but he does not repent of it, as
            he loves his wife. She is uncomfortable, notwithstanding her
            husband’s love, for she is stretched on Procrustes’ bed, and the
            neighbors (neighbors) remark, “she would not be sick, if she
            did not think she was, and one never sees the inside of her
            house.” My brother has educated in part his wife’s nephew,
            whose mother is a widow, and who, like himself, takes greatly
            to natural history, botany especially. This youth’s mother,
            an energetic woman, is justly anxious, that her son, above
            everything should learn to get a living, and she tells him that
            while he is looking at the lining of the nests of birds, he will
            not learn to feather his own nest, and when inquiring so much,
            what the birds eat for breakfast, he will perhaps come short of
            a provision for his own dinner. I shall stay here sometime
            longer, as my health is manifestly improving under my brother’s
            care.	Yours,

         <p>P. S. Tell Ruth next time she broils a chicken, to put a
            plate on it in which a flat-iron is to be set, to press it down;
            something I saw done here with great advantage.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dear Mrs. M--------, Do not trust me too much. I will not
            thank you for your expressions of confidence, it would be so
            base in me not to mean to do all I can. I am sensible I can
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>only be a slender auxiliary to a mother. I shall often be stupid,
             I fear sometimes sleep at my post. We too are collecting
            flowers, insects also interest the children; other pursuits are
            somewhat overlooked just now, for when the tide drives to a
            good port I like to take advantage of it. You can imagine
            how it seems here, such a spreading of petals, creeping, flut tering, and leaping all around. Something new is discovered,
            and flown up to, and made a prize of in every walk. The
             young folks are for doing little else at present but gather the
             golden sands, of the temporary stream that is washing them
            down. All our botanical and entomological books are drawn
            from their winter repose, and heaped up on the table. When
            they go back to the shelves, we shall wake to other things.
            Much delight was expressed with your plan of bringing home
            for loving companions, the beautiful ornaments of the woods.
            Your fresh enthusiasm reminds me of the time when we were
            turning about to come home from----------Swamp, loaded with
            the great laurel and you said, “don’t you think we are as bad
            as Lord Elgin, when he robbed Athens of its marbles.” The
            thing will not be quite what the children anticipate, though a
            very good measure. They are not so well aware as I, that
            the forest-flower in the garden is shorn of its natural glories,
            the shady place, the sudden appearance, the lovely carpet of
            quiet brown leaves or grass, on which it sets its delicate foot,
            the tripping stream, the picturesque gray rock, the majestic
            tree it smiles upon. The children have begun to count up the
            viburnums among the shrubs. You must have, James says,
            every species. It is pleasant to see the various members of a
            genus side by side. I love much to contemplate the genus
            M------together. James, you know, wants nothing less than
            a cornucopia in his hand all the time. The firm Alfred frowns,
            and says, “get one first, and see if we can make it live.” He
            and Mary have been looking very assiduously for a trientales
            gone to seed. They are quite excited about it, it had so seldom been seen; even Linnaeus, of whom the flower was a
            darling, failed. Smith decribes it, as in harmony with its
            general beauty, its delicate petals or petal, its slender stems
            stamens like hairs, its circle of pointed-filing leaves corresponding with its circle of pointed petals, leaves so thin and
            expanded that if endowed with locomotion, it would naturally
            float on the air. As Smith’s description may not be at hand,
            and you might be induced to join in the search for the rarity, I
            will copy it. “The spreading valves of the capsule are highly
            polished internally, and the seeds are enveloped in a most
            elegant white net-work.”
         </p>
         
         <p>This morning, Edith, reading of the lilies of Palestine, that
            surpassed the magnificence of Solomon, wished to know what
            flower was meant. I looked in Sprengel’s Flora Biblica, and,
            to my surprise, did not find it. None in the list can, I think,
            have been so often the subject of inquiry. These wondrous
            lines and hues of beauty, lavished on so transient a splendor,
            were never viewed so holily by other eyes. It shames those
            who, giving thanks for the “fruitful season,” are blind to the
            divine gift of flowers.
         </p>
         
         <p>Did you ever observe Homer's love of flowers? Mercury,
            sent on a message to Calypso, is charmed with the flowers he
            finds on her island—the violet and (Sprengel says) the celery.
            “Herme’s, Heaven's messenger, admiring stood."
            The Greeks looked upon the celery, (called parsley by our
            translators,) I find, as a plant of dignity. It was sacred to the
            infernal gods, and crowned the victor in the Isthmian games.
            I am indebted for this to Sprengel’s Flora Homerica.
         </p>
         
         <p>James has become quite a nice observer. He entertains
            uncle and mother too, and wonders they overlooked the green
            flowers that in all the sumachs precede the berries, whether
            crimson-haired or green. I should not repeat this except to
            the meet ingenuous of mothers.

         <p>The young naturalist must become a clergyman, have a
            country parish, and produce for us here such charming epistles
            as we owe to White of Selborne. Do you remember how we
            longed for this book when we first met with Miss Edgeworth’s
            mention of it, and how I at last sent to England for it? (When
            shall I be so much interested again about any similar innocent
            little thing?) The brute, or the “mute” creation have had
            their early day here—savage reverence; the naturalists and
            poets are crowding along now, to look to its flowers. The
            American poets have certainly celebrated them more warmly
            and graphically than any other poets. Who, in England, have
            ever worshipped Flora like Bryant, Street, and Emerson ?

         <p>Dear Mrs.: In this compelled absence from my children,
            I can never enough congratulate myself upon having such a
            substitute as you. I think their iron axe being lost in the pool,
            they have found a golden one.

         <p>My young naturalist, as you call him, is still pursuing plants
            in the fields and woods. He says he has analyzed all within
            five miles; but he must not believe this fully. He came home
            the other day, and showed a handfull of asters to my brother,
            who remarked, that Cowley called all flowers stars; and the
            other day, when he brought home grass of Parnassus, that he
            thought that must be what Pegassus lived on. I overheard the
            chambermaid say to the cook the other day, “Mr. Henry has
            got something he calls asters, but he does not speak it right—
            he means oysters; but they are not so nice as Chaney ones.’’
            “That angelico that he got,” said she, “is a beautiful airb.”
            The cook wonders at Mr. Henry for keeping caterpillars; they
            are, she says, only fit to tread on; and she despises butterflies,
            both as being common and because they spring from something
            so mean as a caterpillar—having, you see, a great regard for
            honorable descent. I enclose you a little bagatelle of Henry.

         <p>Sir: As I do not belong to a literary race, you may be surprised to receive a letter from me; but I was reminded, by the
            sealing-wax on my wings, to make this beginning of an epistolary correspondence. As I am a near relation to the Waxen
            Chatterer of England, it is not to be wondered at that I should
            have some sociability. Travellers are naturally communicative, and I am a great one—having come to visit you from the
            flowery plains of Mexico; making a short sojourn, as I passed
            along, in the southern and middle States.
         </p>
         
         <p>But I like temperate climates, where grow cherries and
            mulberries; for those juicy fruits are my favorite food. On
            the fourth of July, (which the cherries make a day of jubilee
            to me,) I hear a great deal said of the rights of men, and I wish
            to put in a word of appeal, in behalf of the claims of cherrybirds. Gratitude is said to be a just debt; and why should you
            not then be willing to reward the services, and celebrate the
            merits, of the cherry-birds ? Birds, as well as men, love glory
            and good fare. America commemorates, by a granite monument, the heroes of the Revolution. England gave Blenheim
            to the illustrious Duke of Marlborough; and the splendors of
            Apsley-House attest the nation’s gratitude to the conqueror of
            Waterloo. But though my brethren and I have spent days in
            devouring the pernicious canker-worm, small thanks do we get
            from you and other owners of orchards. You set a boy of 
            straw to guard your cherry-trees, (which though, after we got
            acquainted with him, we did not mind;) it is conclusive evidence you did not make us welcome to your cherries. Yours, 
            you call them; but we think there is great reason to conclude 
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>they were designed for us—there is so great a correspondence and adaptation between our wings and the place where
            they grow. But lately I saw a boy climbing a cherry-tree, and,
            venturing upon too slender a limb, (which, however, would
            have supported many cherry-birds,) down he came to the
            ground; and, as he went limping along, I suppose he has learned
            not again to attempt an enterprise, for which wings, a light
            body, and hollow bones, would alone qualify him. When you
            could not, with your stuffed boy, frighten us away, your son
            comes against us with a gun, so as to leave us no alternative
            but to die, either by shot or hunger. You are so blundering,
            you come to attack us with a blunderbuss, and cannot distinguish your friends from enemies; but on the faith of a bird, if
            you grudge us our reward in cherries and mulberries, we will
            let the canker-worm, in future, destroy, without let or molestation, your apple-trees and elms.
         </p>
         
         <p>Besides, I saw the laborers, under your directions, with a
            sickle, doing what you call cutting up bushes, but I call it destroying the orchard of the birds. From your avarice, you
            cannot spare a small piece of land for the pinipee, holly, cornel,
            and myrtle-berry.
         </p>
         
         <p>You take our lives when you do take that whereon we live.
            At thanksgiving you will eat, with relish, the nice pie made of
            apples that the cherry-bird has saved, without remembering his
            services. Before that time, the cold weather will have driven
            us to the flowery plains of Mexico. There, what with insects
            and fruits, I can get my living, (which I learned in Yankeeland,) though debarred from my favorite food—the juicy fruits
            of the North. I wonder your heart is not softened towards us
            by our rare beauty, (your race loves beauty,) our silken, fawncolored plumage, brilliant eye, and elegant crest. But, exhausted with such an unusual exertion, I must draw to a conclusion. Shocked with your inhospitable reception, we will
            
         </p>
         <p> leave you. Cherry and cedar-trees grow in other places; and,
            if it is our lot to find other States and countries as churlish,
            mean, and grudging as you are, we can lay down in death upon
            our mother earth.

         <p>I like sometimes to take up my pen and let it run on at random, without the trouble of confining it to any one object, or
            definite end. To be sure, there is the old difference between easy writing and easy reading, which is apt, on such occasions, to stare one uncomfortably in the face; but readers not
            unfrequently happen to be in the same mood, and are glad to
            escape from the weight of fixing the intellect on an elaborate
            essay, content to let the languid attention follow the artist’s
            pen, without much caring about the connexion or individuality
            of the subjects. To these easy-minded persons I address myself now; certain, at least, that if my easy writings prove not
            to be easy reading, it will soon cease to be any species of reading whatsoever. Every literary man must find, in the course
            of his studies, that detached thoughts and reflections arise and
            are stored up, which are never called for in the train of his regular pursuits, and such desultory scribbling as this serves to
            brighten them up and leads him to recal old times and associations, the memory of which is indeed sweet

         <p>I have been looking to-day over some of my favorites among
            the lesser stars of the Minor Greek Poets, for whom I feel an
            especial reverence, as having afforded me many a delightful
            hour. I regret much to see, despite other evidences of the
            advancement and improvement of our country, how little the old
            masters of the heart are cultivated and appreciated among us.
            One of the most favored of us, on leaving his studies, has, perchance, been driven through three books of Homer, a tragedy
            of Euiripides, and an ode or two of Pindar. Thoroughly disgusted with the whole, from alpha to omega, he casts them aside
            with all haste, and ever afterwards thinks of them but as the
            forced tasks of his boyhood. This is not as it should be. Leaving out of consideration the acknowledged great ones of antiquity, over whom every college youth trips and stumbles, there is
            a fund of the truest genius among the minor poets of Greece
            alone almost sufficient to repay the time and labor of learning
            the language; and yet they are scarcely known in this country,
            even by name. Who, that is acquainted with the treasures that
            lie concealed in the Greek Anthology, the charming creations of
            Philip of Thessalonica, Macedonius the Consul, Julian the
            Egyptian, Posidippus, Antipater of Sidonia, Antiphilus, Meleager, Agathias the Scholiast, Argantarius, and a host of others
            even less known, or the few and melancholy fragments that remain to us of Simonides, Mimnermua of Colophon,
            <span class="anchor" id="a001">
               <a href="#n001"> Link </a>
            </span>Bacchylides, the epigrams of Callimachus, and others, would be content to part with the key unlocking the casket ? True, there
            have been various translations given to the world. Merivale is
            sometimes happy in catching the spirit of the original, and Bland
            is not without skill as an interpreter. Elton’s “Specimens of
            the Classic Poets” contains many gems, though not well set;
            William Hay, in Blackwood’s Magazine for 1834 and ’35, has
            translated a large part of the Anthology without taste, judgment or skill, and Christopher North, some ten years since, had
            a most excellent series of papers in his own free and easy, proserun-mad style, In which he embalmed not a few precious relics
            of antiquity. But all this is no recompense for the original, as
            it is almost impossible to catch the mingled grace and beauty of
            spirit and diction which renders these valued fragments so inimitable.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mimnermus of Colophon has always been an especial favorite
            with me, though there are but two or three disjecta membra remaining to show us what his productions originally were. His
            seems to have been a lyre of mournful sweetness, and the few
            lines which we possess are filled with laments for the shortness
            of youth and the miseries of age. Ex pede Herculem, I venture on a version of one of his prettiest

            <br></br>Say, what is life, or where its charm,
            
            <br></br>Fair Venus, when thy power hath fled ?
            
            <br></br>Oh, when my breast thou can'st not warm,
            
            <br></br>May I rest coldly with the dead!
            
            <br></br>Yes, when I lose the hopes of love.
            
            <br></br>The secret kiss, the stol'n delights,
            
            <br></br>Which in our youthful hours we prove
            
            <br></br>Through days of bliss and dreamy nights.
            
            <br></br>But, ah! these blossoms of our spring.

            <br></br>Unsparing Age, with ruthless finger,
            
            <br></br>Destroys each beauty where the eye
            
            <br></br>Of love was wont entranced to linger,
            
            <br></br>Till bliss seemed almost agony.
            
            <br></br>He fills the soul with every care,
            
            <br></br>He dulls the senses to the light,—
            
            <br></br>Unblessed, unhonored by the fair,
            
            <br></br>At last his victim sinks to night!
         </div>
         
         <p>Mimnermus himself avoided these evils as long as possible,
            for in his old age he loved the fair Nanne, but whether the scornful damsel slighted him, and made him give utterance to that
            complaint in the last stanza,
            JXV it jii* Jraifi*, dripacroi Si yvvatgiv.
            it would now be hard to tell.
         </p>
         
         <p>But the Anthology is my favorite store-house. Long after
            I became acquainted with its redundant beauties, I could scarcely meet its name, or that of any of its principal contributors,
            without expressing, though of course in a minor degree, the
            sensation mentioned by Mimnermus on seeing a beautiful
            maiden—
            
            <div class="lg"> 
               <br></br>ανγίκ 'έμοί κατά μέν χροιήν ρέεί άσπεγος ίόρώς,
               
               <br></br>πγοιοΰμαι δ'έσωρών άνφος όμιλικίης
            </div>
            and who is there that has not felt the same with his own peculiar authors ? It would scarcely be worth while here to “hold
            a farthing candle to the sun,” by pretending to enter on the
            praise of this exquisite collection, but I will mention one advantage which it possesses in always suiting a man of variable humor. Whatever mood he may be in, here will he find something to accord with it, from the light amatory strains of Rufinua
            or Strata, to the tender melancholy of Meleager, or the stately
            yet simple sorrows of Simonides. And these productions are
            not to be read, stans pede in uno; they will seem to have esoteric
            beauties which are to be discovered only by study, and every
            time that we renew our acquaintance with them, they seem to
            have acquired fresh charms.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the amatory writers in the Anthology, Agathias the
            Scholiast, and Paul the Silentiary are among the most prolific.
            They were friends, the latter holding an office about the court
            of one of the Greek emperors, and compiled what is considered
            as the third Anthology, adding thereto much of their own.—
            Though the age in which they wrote, (the fifth century) was not
            the most favorable to purity of style, yet their productions are
            singularly good. Too many of them, however, are stained with
            the indelicacy which is almost universal among the old writers.
            Here is a pretty little thing by Agathias, in one of his best
            moods, on
            WOMAN'S LOVE.

            exercise the imagination on the subsequent adventures of the
            fair Erinnion, so slightly yet so gracefully described. Did she
            end by becoming the poet’s bride, or was she doomed to wear the
            willow, and sleep with the early primroses, or was her “yet unwounded breast” filled with the image of some faithless deceiver ? These are questions more easily asked than answered.

            like to count up the number of his pretty lady-loves, to each
            whom he swears the firmest attachment in tum. Many of his
            epigrams are inserted in the fifth book, and in Strata’s Movsa
            IIatoike. I give a rough version of one most originally in-
            elegant.

            <br></br>Mais, en me retirant, elle rests derriere,

         <p>This has been translated very often, yet I feel inclined to try
            my hand at it:
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>When to thy lips I wildly clung,
            
            <br></br>To mine my very soul upsprung,
            
            <br></br>To taste the bliss that breathed from thee.
            
            <br></br>But when that long-drawn kiss was o’er.
            
            <br></br>It staid with thee, to leave no more
            
            <br></br>The sweets that round thee ever be!
         </div>
         
         <p>But I am transgressing all due bounds, having already scribbled much more than was in my intention when I took up the
            pen, and I break off, feeling that I have shown some of my favorites in their least auspicious moods,—that of love. Perhaps
            some of my readers may feel surprised at this, but Grecian love
            was a very different thing from what we now understand by that
            name. At some future time, I may take up this prolific theme.

            <p>The Aesthetic Letters, Essays, and the Philosophical Let-
               ters of Schiller: Translated, with an Introduction, by J.
               Weiss. Boston, Charles C. Little, and James Brown; 1845, pp.

            <p>Among the many flattering titles which the American people
               has, at due intervals, seen fit to bestow upon itself, that of a j
               “reading people” is, perhaps, the one which has been most
               insisted upon and most tenaciously clung to. From certain
               unsightly pieces of rottenness in our social fabric, our claim to
               be the “freest and most enlightened nation on the face of the
               earth,"” though rigorously asserted by fourth of July orators,
               and swallowed unsuspiciously by fourth of July audiences, has
               come to be generally doubted by the thoughtful; in spite of,
               now and then, a Philadelphia symphony or opera, which are, |
               indeed, reservoirs of noise vast enough, if conveyed by proper
               ttreporiducts, to supply all the musical composers of the world,
               we are hardly yet on a level with Germany in taste or enthu- J
               siasm for music; our poetry is said to be conveyed, in surrep- |
               titious phialsfull, from the English Helicon; in painting and
               sculpture, we have no recognised standard of authoritative
               judgment, and bestow sums upon fignre-head cutters and signpainters which might have saved from starving worthy rivals 
               of Phidias and Titian. But who can deny to us the glory of 
               being a “reading people ?” Who can penetrate into our kitchens, and confute the theory we have established, that our cooks 
               first read, ere they singe their fowls with the sybilline leaves
               of neglected epics and tragedies, which sputter, as they burn,
               with a Byronic exultation of scorn for the unappreciating world
               which shall, too late, lament their incremation 1 Who shall
               deny that our chambermaids draw a refining influence from the
               fugitive verses which, with an Orphean potency, have taught
               the savage locks of their mistresses to wander into hyacinthine
               curls 1 Who but a Pyrrhonist would doubt the existence of
               those hordes of Nomadic bipliopoles who haunt our railway stations and steamboat-wharves, arrayed, with emblematic propriety, in that last stage of cloth, ere it is transmuted into material for the author and the printer ?
            </p>
            
            <p>No, we are emphatically a reading people; but, before making a boast of it, we should do well to consider what we read. 
               Flocks of pamphlets on green, and blue, and yellow wings,
               hover over the land—obscene volucres—to snatch at and beslime, like harpies, whatever is pure and healthfully-nourishing
               for the soul. Under the very eaves of our churches and colleges, these filthy creatures hang their nests, prolific of infamy
               and vice; they perch upon the roofs of our lyceums and lecturerooms; they disturb the hitherto peaceful recesses of our hamlets and villages with hoarse screams for their prey of garbage
               and ordure. Literature, in the true sense of the word, is dead;
               and the only creatures who can be said to live by it are the
               vermin who riot and feast upon its decay. That this state of
               things is mainly attributable to the want of an international
               copyright law, we have never had a doubt. It is of the literature which is supplied to the mass of the people that we speak—
               for this the most important. Bad food will produce disease
               as well in the spiritual as the material world. What a fascinating sound has these two words, “cheap literature!” We
               fondly imagine the ploughman drinking inspiration from his
               fourpenny Burns, and the cobbler hanging entranced over Bunyan’s prose translation of Dante. The blacksmith, we think,
               will swing his sledge to the cadence of a shilling Milton, and
               Miss Barrett will become the solace of the factory girl for sixpence! Grogshops will be displaced by bookstalls, and, instead
               of “best liquors at three cents a glass,” we shall see “Bacon
               for six cents,” “Spenser at a shilling,” “Don Quixotte ten
               oentaor, if the vender be poetical, he will give u» “a slice
               
               
               <div class="columnbreak"></div>of Bacon for fourpence,” “breast of Lamb for sixpence,”
               “glass of Shakspeare at three cents.” To think of Apollo
               visiting our floor-hearths for eighteen and three-quarter cents,
               or “the muses to be seen here; admittance quarter of a dollar!” But alas! this is but an auctioneer’s picture of the beauty
               of the system. The cabalistic fingers of a George Robbins
               may be detected pulling the wires of this magnificent fairyscene. The literature which really circulates among the
               masses, and steals through the gateway of our national morals
               for so cheap a toll, is the literature of the pickpocket, the burglar, and the bawd; or, if not this, it is the last pitiful drivellings of sentimentalism in its dotage. We wish that our
               legislators—whose sinful apathy to the true interests of our
               literature, and, therefore, of our morals, has created this brazen monster—could be forced to try the involuntary philosophical experiment of Perillus. We wish that they might be
               made the first tests of the efficiency of this system for the education of the people, by being compelled to read all the books
               which issue from our so-called cheap presses.
            </p>
            
            <p>The book before us is of a very different kind: it is the production of a refined and thoughtful scholar. The translator is
               a clergyman in the neighborhood of Boston, who preaches to
               a rustic audience sermons worthy of the English pulpit when
               its poetry was supplied by Taylor, and its wit by South. A
               residence in Germany has given him familiarity with the language of his original, and a hearty love of Schiller makes him
               a worthy translator of its spirit.
            </p>
            
            <p>These letters of Schiller are by no means “familiar” ones:
               they are addressed to one of those Princes (Christian Frederick, Duke of Holstein Augustenburg) who took a dilletante
               interest in the rights of man at the beginning of the French
               Revolution. Schiller had received noble and unexpected aid
               from him during a period of great distress; and though he was
               a man who could look through the star on the breast to the
               heart underneath it, yet it is clear that he had only acquired
               the faculty (so hard to gain in aristocratical communities) of
               looking on his benefactor as merely man, and had not yet
               reached the more unconscious point of regarding him as friend.
               The letters, therefore, are not written with the abandon of
               private friendship, if, indeed, their subject would have allowed it.
            </p>
            
            <p>The translator has prefixed an excellent introduction, written
               with judgment and eloquence, in which the reader will find a
               far better analysis of the book than we are prepared to give.
               The following extract from it contains a view of the relation
               of Goethe and Schiller to each other, which is new to us, and
               which we deem worthy of attention—as well from its novelty
               as the exactness and pertinence with which it is stated:
            </p>
            
            <p>“We have lately fallen into the error (for which we are indebted to Germany herself) of forcing an unnatural contrast
               between Goethe and Schiller, her too greatest men. Scholars
               spend their ingenuity in drawing parallels and exposing differences, when the true process would be, to construct an equation, and indicate the points of contact. The error has become
               almost irremediable; and it seems to be generally understood,
               that the two men would have never lived together in Weimar
               if Providence had not designed to puzzle posterity with the
               contrast, and to occupy its leisure moments with the debate as
               to which is the greater. They have unfortunately passed into
               history with the legal versus between their names, which never
               kept asunder the Doe and Roe of fiction with a more abiding
               pertinacity.
            </p>
            
            <p>“This is a great injury which we inflict upon ourselves.
               Undoubtedly, the delightful period of their common activity at
               Weimar affords the most natural opportunity for instituting a
               j comparison between them, which is not without its interest and
               advantage. Their mutual tendencies differed too distinctly to
               escape observation. Perhaps they challenge it; and perhaps
               the two poets are not worthy as successful exponents of the
               two great elements of humanity—the real and the ideal; for
               neither was Goethe the whole man, nor was Schiller the less
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page409"></div>
               
               
               <div class="columnbreak"></div>complete one he has been represented. But it is in this very 
               distinctness with which they developed, respectively, those two
               great elements, that we ought to discern, not only the special
               mission of each, but the still higher mission of both united. It
               is striking to observe how their diversity produces a unity. It
               would be instructive to analyze their characters, in order to
               perceive their capacity for creating a third character, which
               is the idea of humanity—the result of the two tendencies which
               make a man. It seems, then, as if that period of their artistic 
               union was a lucky manoeuvre of nature to bring together her
               two elements most favorably developed, that she might ‘ give
               the world assurance of a man.' Where Goethe was deficient,
               Schiller abounded; where the latter yearned to express that
               which is absolute, the former fulfilled definite and ascertained
               limits. Both were earnest seekers after truth: it was, for
               both, the very condition of their existence—a demand of their
               consciousness which they never once evaded. But we attain
               a steadfast form of truth and a harmonious development of
               human faculties, only by combining the results of both; or,
               rather, a true man, made after the Divine image, is the union
               of both their tendencies. There will be a residue if we attempt
               to unite the two men as they were; but, that excepted, the
               product is the type of that which is possible within us, and, as
               such, it should be prized, studied, and never rudely violated.
               When German scholars have asked, ‘Which is greater—
               Goethe ?—Schiller ?’—others have sought to deprecate such a
               distinction, and have taken refuge in the simile of the Dioscuri; but even that will not serve our turn, for an alternate
               immortality does not become those who are really immortal and
               available only when made into one.” Pp. 7, 8, 9.
            </p>
            
            <p>Elsewhere, Mr. Weiss says, beautifully:—</p>
            
            <p>“The undeniable characters of a good life cannot be denied
               to Schiller; he is known by his works in every sense. Pure,
               highminded, truthloving, enamored of virtue for her own sweet
               sake, he presents to us the lofty spectacle of a man pursuing
               the ideal of his race through every opposition, disappointment,
               loss. He would realize Christianity, which is the moral law
               transfigured by love. In his own person he represents the
               struggles of humanity; his life was an unfinished prophecy.
               It is inspiring because his deeds were vast, and rang like the
               sound of a trumpet; it is pathetic and purifying because it contained the divine element of sorrow, and we are given to see
               a spirit, not only battling with the world and with necessities,
               but wellnigh overmastered with its own yearning. He was
               the direct ambassador of the ideal; he had an indefeasible
               right to dictate to humanity the terms of its culture, because
               he evolved it from the regenerative idea of duty as love. And
               what he preached, he practised. * *	*	* His maturer
               writings present to us his genuine creed and philosophy, and
               show us his heart still honest and pure, still unstormed, though
               a Titanic intellect had often encamped before it.” Pp. 30, 31.
            </p>
            
            <p>But Schiller was no apostle of the ideal in the sense which
               those understand it who would make it an excuse for a weak
               dereliction from fidelity to the truth of absolute nature. By
               “ideal,” he meant that highest perfection of nature which only
               the inspired eye of the true artist can discern. His ideal was
               not out of the world, but in it. He was not one of those who,
               not strong enough nor wise enough to follow nature, are inter- 
               ested to make us believe that the region of art is some cloudy
               realm, the product of their own fancy, and that the beautiful is
               some misty, undefined shape, which they are pleased to call
               “classical,” as if God must give over creating, and go to school 
               to their abecedarian profundity.
            </p>
            
            <p>Referring the reader again to Mr. Weiss’s excellent intro- 
               duction for an analysis of the book, we proceed to make a few
               short extracts—such as our space will allow—taken almost at
               random. We will preface them with the following fit text
               from the first letter.
            </p>
            
            <p>“My ideas, drawn rather from a uniform converse with myself than from a rich experience, or from reading, will not deny
               their origin; they will sooner be guilty of any error than of
               sectarism, and will rather fall from their own weakness than
               maintain themselves by authority and foreign strength.” P. 2.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the following passage, Schiller beautifully describes the
               aspect under which ancient Greece presented itself to his
               mind:
            </p>
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            <p>“The Greeks shame us, not only by a simplicity to which
               our age is a stranger, but they are, at the same time, our rivals
               —nay, after our model—in that very pre-eminence with which
               we are wont to console ourselves for the native perverseness
               of our manners. At once objective and subjective—at once
               philosophic and creative, tender and energetic—we behold the
               youth of fancy united in a noble humanity to the manliness of
               reason.
            </p>
            
            <p>“In the beautiful awakening of the spiritual powers at that
               period, sense and spirit had no strongly-marked peculiarity.

               </span>
               No dispute had yet constrained them to withdraw, in a hostile
               manner, from each other, and define their boundaries. Poesy
               had not yet contended with wit, and speculation had not dis graced itself by craft. In case of need, both could exchange
               their functions; since each revered truth after its own fashion.
               However high reason soared, it ever lovingly lifted the outward after it, and however finely and sharply it discriminated,
               still it never lacerated. It is true it analyzed human nature
               and threw its amplified elements into the majestic circle of divinities; but not thereby tearing it in pieces, only mingling it
               diversely, since a complete humanity was wanting to no single
               god. How entirely different with us moderns! With us too,
               the type of the race is thrown, in parts that are amplified, into
               individuals; but in fragments, not in different combinations;
               so that one must enquire from individual to individual in order
               to read collectively the totality of the race. With us, one is
               almost tempted to affirm, the powers of the mind display themselves in experience detached, as they are represented by the
               psychologist, and we see, not only single subjects, but whole
               classes of men developing only one part of their dispositions,
               while the remainder, like stunted plants, preserve vestiges of
               their nature almost too feeble to be recognised.” Pp. 19-20,
               Letter 6.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the ninth letter, the exuberant stream of Schiller’s eloquence, which has been working its way through the tangled
               roots and cloven rocks of definitions and argumentative premises, with here and there a glassy spot reflecting the sky and
               leaves, or a singing cascade, burst forth free and majestic, and
               flows on in rushing gladness, singing the triumph of its release.
               We would gladly copy the whole of it, had we room. Even
                if the translator had not informed us of it in his preface, we
               should have felt sure that this letter was a favorite with him,
               for it is turned into English with admirable fidelity to the
               meaning, and lucky sympathy with the rhythmic enthusiasm
               of the original. Throughout the whole book, but particularly
               in this letter, we feel that translation has been a labor of love
               and no drudge-work with Mr. Weiss. Though our extracts
               have already been long, we must give our readers one or two
               passages from this letter.
            </p>
            
            <p>“It is true the Artist is the son of his time, but alas for
               him if he be likewise its pupil, or even its favorite. Let a
               kind Divinity snatch the suckling betimes from his mother’s
               breast, nourish him with the milk of a bitter age, and let him
               come to maturity beneath a distant Grecian sky. Then, when
               he has become a man. let him return, a foreign shape, into his
               century; not to delight it with his appearance, but terrible,
               like Agamemnon’s son, to purify it. He will take his material,
               indeed, from the present, but borrow his form from a nobler
               time, nay, from beyond all time, from the absolute, unchangeable unity of his being. Here, from the pure ether of his Divine nature, runs down the fountain of beauty, undefiled by
               the corruption of races and times which fret far beneath him
               in troubled whirlpools.
            </p>
            
            <p>* * * * *“But how can the Artist protect himself
               from the corruptions of his age which on all sides surround
               him ? By despising its judgment. Let him look upward to
               his dignity and the law, not downward to his prosperity and
               his wants. Alike free from the vain activity that would fain
               leave its traces on the fleeting moment, and from the impatient
               enthusiasm that applies the scale of the absolute to the paltry
               product of time, let him leave to the understanding, which is
               here at home, the sphere of the actual; but let him strive
               to evolve the ideal from the union of the possible with the
               necessary. This let him express in fiction and truth, in the
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page410"></div>
               
               
               <div class="columnbreak"></div>play of his fancy and the gravity of his deeds, in all sensible
               and spiritual forms, and cast it silently into infinite time.” Pp.
               36, 37.
            </p>
            
            <p>From the essay on Pathos we make one extract containing
               a criticism which has a wider application than to its immediate object, and which fits many modern productions as closely
               as the old French Drama.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The latter is the case with the old French Tragedy, in
               which we are very seldom or never shown a suffering nature,
               but generally see only cold, declamatory poets, or comedians upon
               stilts. The frosty tone of declamation extinguishes all the
               nature, and their adorable scenery makes it completely impossible for French tragic poets to portray humanity in its truth.
               Decency falsifies, even in its own proper place, the expression
               of nature, and yet the art demands the latter imperatively.
               We can hardly believe it in a French tragic hero that he suffers, for he delivers himself concerning his state of mind like
               the calmest of men, and his incessant regard to the impression
               which he makes upon others never allows him to leave to his
               own nature its freedom. The kings, princesses and heroes of
               a Corneille and a Voltaire never forget their rank in the most
               vehement passion, and they put off their humanity far sooner
               than their dignity. They are like the kings and emperors in
               the old picture books, who go to bed with their crowns on.”
               Pp. 202, 203.
            </p>
            
            <p>We must here reluctantly leave a book for which the Translator deserves our warmest thanks. It is full to overflowing
               with deep philosophy, as well of life as of morals, with profound
               criticisms and apothegms upon art, with true poetry, the whole
               all aglow with the warm sunlight of a noble and aspiring
               nature. It is a book, too, which demands study, and which
               exercises while it instructs. We sincerely hope that Mr.
               Weiss may be encouraged to persevere in a labor for which he
               has shown such eminent qualifications, and that he will give
               to the world the other volume of translations from Schiller at
               which he hints in his introduction.
            </p>
            
            <p> Besides the Esthetic letters, the present volume contains
               essays upon “The necessary limits in the use of beautiful
               forms,” “The moral use of AEsthetic manners,” “The pathetic,” “The sublime,” “The use of the common and low
               in Art,” “Disconnected observations upon various AEsthetic
               subjects,” “Upon the tragic art,” and “The philosophical
               letters.” We learn that it has already been re-published in
               England.

            <p>This is the most valuable of all the books which Mr.
               Downing has contributed to the higher departments of our
               rural literature, and it is the most charming book of the season, although rather ponderous in dimensions only. Some
               idea may be formed of its completeness from the fact of its
               containing a list of no less than 490 sorts of apples. Mr.
               Downing claims the right to talk about fruits and trees from
               having been born in “one of the largest gardens, and upon
               the banks of one of the noblest rivers, in America;" every
               body will concede the right, since he has shown himself so
               competent to his task. “Fine fruit is the flower of commodities;” and, as Mr. Downing says in his preface, “it is the
               most perfect union of the useful and the beautiful that the
               earth knows; yet there are many who seem to live under
               some ban of expulsion from all the fair and goodly productions of the garden." But this should not be. Every proprietor of a piece of ground big enough to bleach a pocket
               handkerchief is bound to cultivate a fruit tree of some kind, if
               not for himself, for the sake of others; and if there be any
               
               
               <div class="columnbreak"></div>people who are indifferent to pomological matters, we advise
               them to procure Mr. Downing's work and plunge into the
               midst of his pearmains, rare-ripes, and damsons. All the
               true disciples of pomology will get the book, as a matter of
               course.

         <div class="head">FRENCH OPERA AT THE PARK THEATRE.</div>
         
         <p>The French Company, last from New Orleans, is in the
            second week of its engagement at the above Theatre. The
            list of its members presents a very formidable array of names,
            at least in numbers, and, with Calve at the head, it would be
            supposed sufficient for all purposes of attraction. Whether
            it will prove so or not, will be determined by and by. Of the
            merits of the individual members, we shall speak in detail in
            the course of our notice.
         </p>
         
         <p>One thing we should strongly urge upon Mr. Davis, namely,
            the absolute necessity of lowering the price of admission to the
            pit, from one dollar to fifty cents. Not only would the attendance be more than double upon every occasion, but the
            house would also assume a more lively and brilliant appearance. There are hundreds of young men who would willingly
            go to the Opera every performing night, but who will not pay
            a dollar, and will not go up stairs to the second tier, and so
            stay away altogether.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first opera performed was Guillaume Tell, composed
            by Rossini. The following was the distribution of characters:
            Arnold, M. Arnaud; Guillaume Tell, Garry; Walter, Douvry; Rodolpbe, Coeuriot; Gesler, Douvry; Melctbal, Bernard; Leuthold, Chaffary; A Fisherman, Pelleve; Princess
            Mathilde, Mrs. Casini; Jemmy, (son of Guillaume Tell,) Stephen Coeuriot; Edwige, (wife of Guillaume Tell,) Daire;
            Chorus of officers, pages, Austrian soldiers, Swiss men, women, and children. The plot of Guillaume Tell is so well
            known on every hand, that we shall not trouble our readers by
            recapitulating it.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the music, Rossini has in a measure gone from his peculiar and recognised style. The general characteristics are
            gravity, earnestness, and intense passion. There are, of
            course, many passages of lighter feeling, in which we recognise the brilliant and felicitous imagination so peculiar to his
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page411"></div>
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>earlier works; but these are only used as lights to the sombre
            tone which pervades the general subjeet. It is true they are
            dashed in with the freedom of a master-hand, and fix themselves upon the memory at once, from their strong but harmonious contrast.
         </p>
         
         <p>Madame Casini is by no means calculated to sustain an
            important part in a Grand Opera. Her voice is thin and
            weak, though the upper tones possess some sweetness. Her
            singing gives evidence of some good schooling, but her style
            is unfinished, and her delivery lacks energy and passion.
            Her action is constrained and awkward, and for a pretty woman, and a French woman, too, she is the most careless
            dresser we ever saw. The two other ladies, Madame Coeuriot and Madame Dairie, had but little to do, but that little
            was well done.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Garry possesses a voice of good quality, but it is sadly
            deficient in power; it is, however, capable of forcing, particularly in the upper tones. M. Garry is a superior artist. He
            sings with much taste, and in admirable style: his modulations are made with a certainty and precision, which stamp
            him a musician as well as a singer. His action is free and
            vigorous, and altogether, although from want of physical
            strength, he will never astonish his hearers, he will rarely fail
            to impart pleasure and satisfaction by his general excellence.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Arnaud is a singer of high merit. He possesses a voice
            of extraordinary compass and power, and were it as sweet and
            rich as it is extensive and powerful, he would have no equal
            in the world. His style is admirable—chaste and impassioned, and altogether free from vulgarity and affectation. We
            listened to him with much pleasure from his first appearance,
            for we immediately perceived that he depended not upon his
            voice but upon the purity of his school, and as soon as our
            ears became accustomed to the singular quality of his voice,
            we listened to him with the most unqualified delight. He
            reminds us strongly of what Antognini was when he first came
            to this city. The part of Arnold is one of immense difficulty,
            and we do not hesitate to say that there is no man in the
            country, except M. Arnaud, who would dare to undertake it.
            M. Arnaud will rise in public estimation upon each appearance, and will become a distinguished favorite.
         </p>
         
         <p>Messieurs Douvry, Coeuriot, Bernard, &amp;c. &amp;c., were all excellent in their respective parts. We shall have occasion,
            however, to notice them more fully in other pieces, and to
            decide upon their merits.
         </p>
         
         <p>The chorus is admirable: undoubtedly the best we have
            heard on these boards for several years. Everything was
            given with great precision and power; the trebles were few in
            number, but they were efficient. The contraltos have capital
            voices. They are in some parts too powerful for the trebles.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Orchestra is very perfect—composed of fine players,
            and led by one who thoroughly understands his business, M.
            Prevost. No such orchestra has been gathered together
            within the walls of a theatre for many years. It was a pleasure to observe with what admirable faithfulness the beautiful points in the instrumentation were brought out in strong
            relief. Nothing was lost, nothing was obscured. We are glad
            to be able to award to the members, individually, and to the
            leader of the orchestra, our unqualified approbation.
         </p>
         
         <p>The piece was brought out with great magnificence, and
            with due attention to time and locality. The scenery, especially the set scenes, was beautiful, and the costumes were
            carefully selected according to the date.
         </p>
         
         <p>As a whole the performance was good, and well worthy the
            liberal patronage of the public.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are several omissions which we might mention, but
            we presume that they were omitted from necessity.
         </p>
         
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         <p>Auber’s Opera Les Diamans de Couronne, was chosen for
            the re-appearance of Mad’lle Calve, after an absence of two
            years.
         </p>
         
         <p>The distribution of the Opera was as follows: Caterino,
            Mad’lle Calve; Diana, Mad. Stephen Coeuriot; Don Henrique, M. Coeuriot; Don Sebatien, M. Buscher; Rebolledo.
            M. Bernard; Camp Mayor, M. Mathieu.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mad’lle Calve was received most warmly. She has improved in personal appearance since she was here last. She
            has lost none of her fascination of manner, but on the contrary, seems to have made the charm more powerful. She
            was dressed to perfection, and wore her dresses with an air
            and grace peculiar to herself, and rarely attained by any one
            else. Her school of singing we never did admire—it is false,
            meritricious and flashy: but Calve sings well in her school,
            and for that she should have all praise. Indeed Calve seems
            to have been destined for the school of which Auber is the
            bead, for her aril, piquant, and playful manner adds a charm
            and a grace to that most charming and graceful class of composition. Calve’s performance upon this occasion was in
            truth all that could be desired, and won for her, besides the
            hearty plaudits of the audience, a whole host of bouquets.
         </p>
         
         <p>Madame Stephen Coeuriot somewhat surprised us upon
            this occasion. From her performance in Guillaume Tell we
            were convinced that she had talent, but we hardly gave her
            credit for so much excellence as she displayed on Friday
            night. She has a melodious and sufficiently powerful voice,
            and uses it like an article. Her costumes are in admirable
            taste, and are worn with much grace. She acts well and
            looks well, and in short she supplies, very nearly, the place
            in public estimation which Madame Le Compt held loo years
            since.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Coeuriot is equally excellent in his way. He possesses
            a light and pleasing tenor voice, with a carefully cultivated
            and well-managed falsetto. He sings with much taste and
            judgment, and is an actor of considerable merit. He is a
            great acquisition to the company.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Buscher is a careful and well-educated singer, but his
            voice is weak, and his action is tame and timid.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Bernard is truly comic: his humor is unobtrusive, but
            it is so dry and earnest that it becomes infectious. He is besides a very careful singer and capital actor.
         </p>
         
         <p>The other parts were very creditably sustained. The chorus
            was exceedingly good throughout—indeed, so good that it became a feature.
         </p>
         
         <p>The performance of the orchestra was admirable throughout
            —even more perfect than upon the occasion of Guillaume Tell.
            We have rarely heard accompaniments more faithfully and distinctly rendered. M. Prevost and the gentleman of the orchestra shared equally the just admiration of the public.
         </p>
         
         <p>The music, by Auber, is singularly beautiful. From the
            beginning to the end, it is a series of brilliant thoughts, worked
            out in a masterly manner. Quite original, after the style of
            Auber, its quaintness immediately strikes the most indifferent
            observer. Its melodies are indeed ravishingly beautiful; it is
            richly harmonised, and its distinguishing characteristic is never
            lost sight of.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Instrumentation is perfect. More or less beautiful and
            startling effects and charming contributions are found in every
            piece. Their number surprises us, their novelty delights us,
            and we admiringly acknowledge Auber to be the most ingenious
            and effective orchestral writer among the modern operatic composers of Europe.
         </p>
         
         <p>We cordially recommend the French Operatic Company to
            our musical friends.
         </p>
         
         <p>La Favorite, composed by Donizetti, was produced on
            Wednesday last. We shall notice it in our next.

         <p>We were invited to examine the portrait of the new packet
            ship Henry Clay, painted by Mr. Marsh, of Boston, who has
            certainly succeeded in giving a very striking likeness of this
            noble ship; his water, however, is the best part of the picture.
            In other marine paintings that we have seen, the water has
            been painted as though it were an accessory, instead of being
            a principal, element in a sea scene. The ship is represented
            under full sail, with the wind on the quarter, and a fore-topmast studding sail set. There is a distant view of the Highlands of Neversink and Sandy Hook. We understand that
            the painting is intended for a present to Mr. Clay from the
            owners of the ship.
         </p>
         
         <p>We remember Mr. Marsh as the author of a volume of
            poems which were published in this city a few years since;
            but we have never heard of him before as a marine painter.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Alfred Jones, the engraver of “Sparking,” one of the
            Art-Union issues, has just published a handsome engraving of
            the Capitol, at Washington. The view is taken from Pennsylvania Avenue, and represents the back part of the Capitol,
            with the noble terraces, fountain, &amp;c. It makes a very handsome picture; but, being an enlargement of the small drawing
            by Bartlett, in the views of American scenery published by
            Martin, it is rather meagre in the details for so large an engraving.

         <div class="head">WEEKLY NOTES.</div>
         
         <p>A novel has recently been published by Colburn, in London, called “Jonathan Sharp, or the Adventures of a Kentuckian,” which is professedly written by an American, but
            the fact is questioned by a critic in the Athenaeum for the
            following reasons:
         </p>
         
         <p>“Beyond the Alleghanies, Lynch law is too rife and
            too supreme; and, even in an Atlantic city, such a moral
            censor would find his post so little enviable as to be in some
            hurry to quit it. He might, to be sure, come to England,
            as the author in question professes to have done, and published whatever he pleased. But could the pure love of
            truth, or the patriotic view of scolding his countrymen into
            belter manners, be a sufficient inducement ? Besides, to
            expect an American, whose self love and national pride surpass those of any people on earth, so to divest himself of his
            nature as to view things through an European glass is absurd.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The reviewer surmises that Jonathan Sharp is an Irishman; but, from his close intimacy with the peculiarities of
            Western manners, we are inclined to believe that he is what
            he professes, a genuine United Stateser, but not a Kentuckian.
            He must, however, be a very bad fellow, so to libel his countrymen as to call forth such a rebuke as this from an English
            critic, whose remarks prove him to be neither well informed
            on American subjects, nor well disposed towards the country.
         </p>
         
         <p>" In almost every page he evinces his personal and intimate
            acquaintance with his subject. But that he is invariably as
            honest as he is well informed, is a very different subject.
            The soreness which he displays in every chapter, can be the
            result only of personal disappointment. If, in most instances,
            he has truth for the foundation of his statements, he takes
            good care to stretch it as far as it will bear—sometimes a little
            farther. What justice is there in an author who condemns a
            New Englander for vices which are found to exist only when
            we come to the Valley of the Mississippi, &amp;c.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The Englishman has a strange view of American morals,
            if he thinks that violence of any kind would be offered to any
            man, on this side the Atlantic, for speaking his opinions freely
            of the national manners or vices. Abuse of every kind may
            be uttered with such “perfect looseness” that satire and irony
            have lost their uses with us. We have neither Punches nor
            Charlvaris iu America, for the reason that there is no need of
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>them. It would be idle to satirise a vice which can be boldly
            exposed.
         </p>
         
         <p>We can suggest a better reason for the author of Jonathan
             Sharp having published his adventures in London than the
            Athenaeum has given: probably he could not find a publisher
            in America, and was too poor to undertake the publication
            himself.
         </p>
         
         <p>The last number of Tait’s Magazine contains a very generous and discriminating Review of the “Poems on Mao in
            the Republic,” by Cornelius Matthews; and the Athenaeum
            has a funny notice of the “Letters from a Landscape Painter,” by Charles Lanman. Mr. Cole, and the other artists
            who had the ill fortune to be served up by Mr. Lanman, form
             the subjects of a good many witty jokes, while Mr. Lanman’s
             Burlington friends, who gave such capital dinners, and were,
            withal, such perfect scholars and gentlemen, come in for their
            share of fun.

         <p>The past winter has been one of dismal heaviness to us, for
             it has been so to many dear friends; a cold bleak “season”—
            each month surpassing its predecessor in the number of its bereavements, until we have asked each other, “Is the cup of
            sorrow yet unfilled ?” All through February and March the
            dull boom of the death-bell mingled with the snow-wreath and
            rose above the storm, while the frost-bound earth echoed the
            clank of the mattock and the spade. We do not speak of the
            simple hearts, near and dear, whom death found as fittest for
            immortality—ripest for the sickle—but of others, known to the
            world about us, who have been taken “home” in the flower of
            their days; and more especially of one, just gone, whose gentle spirit past away while nature was recruiting,—resuming
             her leaves and flowers, and wearing once again a happy look
            of plenteousness and peace.
         </p>
         
         <p> First, from over the sea, came news of the death of one
            who, if longer spared, would have achieved a much higher
            reputation than she had yet won—for her mind was evidently
            gaining strength, and her views of life and knowledge of literature were expanding. One of our contemporaries has said,
             that Mary Anne Browne was “spoiled at first by over-praise;"
             over-praised the girl-poet might have been, but none who have
            read what she has written as Mrs. James Gray, could have
            deemed her “spoiled”—for all her later works evince care
             and thought, and much genuine refinement; and her last small
            volume of poems—“Sketches from the Antique”—supply ev idence of higher hopes and holier aspirations than belong to the
             “spoiled” children of the Muses. Her short life, though
             uneventful, was chequered and of uneven course—as literary
            lives always are in England—but she was a loving and a be loved wife, esteemed by those who knew her as a kind and
            amiable woman, and one of rare industry. I found it hard to
             believe that death had taken her from the new-born infant that
            nestled in her bosom; that the grave had closed over the
             laughing girl I had seen but as yesterday—her rich brown
             curls clustering round her throat, and her eyes luminous with
            mirth.
         </p>
         
         <p> But heavier sorrows followed. There are few, indeed, who
            are acquainted with the light and graceful literature of our
            country—who cull the simple and natural flowers so plentifully scattered in their paths—to whom the name of Laman
            Blanchard is unknown: his ready and eloquent pen could indite a sonnet, point an epigram, tell a story, or lend interest to
             an essay, while slower spirits were wondering and pondering
            what they had to write about.
         </p>
         
         <p>His name was a pleasant watchword, a guarantee that something was to follow—racy and fanciful. His wit, rather genial than caustic, and so abounding that it brightened everything it played about, was checked only by a sensible desire to
            avoid giving pain; even where to censure became a duty, this
            tenderness in his nature was apparent in his writings: he frequently stopped short of his object lest he might inflict a
            wound. Of late, few articles bore his name in periodical
            works; and those who are unacquainted with the mighty mechanism that scatters “leaders,” “criticisms,” and “reviews,”
            —“opinions” of all kinds on all subjects to guide the multitude,—little imagine what volumes have passed down the
            stream of time—written for “the day,” by this man of many
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page413"></div>
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>labors, but upon which the power of the throbbing brain had
            been lavishly expended.
         </p>
         
         <p>Sixteen years ago we knew him; ever as a poet, bouyant
            with youth and hope—his purpose fixed, his independence unflinching—with the dreamy, ardent temperament of a genuine 
            “child of song,” yet turning himself to the direst and hardest
            duty work, and laboring at everything that did not compromise 
            the principles with which he set out in life,—fighting his way 
            with a brave heart and a bright eye, known only to be loved,
            and imparting as much pleasure to, as he received from, literary society. Many are the happy and profitable hours we have 
            passed together; his ready sympathy attracting confidence
            that was never betrayed. Alas! his wife became the victim
            of a distressing malady; and his sensitive nerves were ill able 
            to endure long midnight watchings, relieved only by midnight
            labor—the coin with which genius purchases bread. She died
            some months ago, and to all but him her death seemed a mercy. From that time, however, his light of life either blazed
            or flickered, as it was excited. He rose up, and went about,
            and wrote, when he could, but fancied, and perhaps truly, that
            he could not write as he had done. The fact was, his mind
            required repose—a total absence from labor—it craved rest; 
            but how is the producer of periodical literature to find rest ?
            People tell you “not to be excited,” “not to overwork yourself.” Ah! they cannot see underneath the gay draperies
            that society folds around the form—they cannot see the chains
            that bind us to the galley. A terror that he should be unable
            to provide for his children took hold of our poor friend—seized him by the brain through the heart; his eyes became affected—to all appearance they were as bright as ever, but he
            could not endure the light, and continued to suffer intensely; 
            his imagination appeared to retain its power after his reason
            had given way; and thus was the fountain of life exhausted at
            one-and-forty! The eloquent and tender poet—the man with
            many real friends, yet dying in harness which, if one ready
            hand had unbuckled for a time, might have been worn, after a
            brief rest, in honor for many years! Not but he was difficult
            to manage; loathe to owe any debt save to his own exertions; 
            and proud—as all right-thinking men must be—of the independence that had won the respect and friendship of the intellectual and the true; and it was hard, when you saw his bright
            face or heard his pleasant words, to think of him and sorrow
            the sure suggestion was, that he would be better by-and-by.
            Ah! it was a mournful termination to such a life.
         </p>
         
         <p>And, after he was laid in his grave, the bells tolled on; another and another passed away—names highly honored in Art
            —Calcott, Smirke, Phillips, the gentle and highly-gifted Duncan; and now one whose name has long been a household
            word, but whose death has been anticipated for months, say,
            for years—the noble poet—yet, strange to say, better known
            as the annual “jester”—Thomas Hood! Truly, the man
            who, year after year, furnished abundant food for mirth, and
            yet could imagine “The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies,”
            “The Dream of Eugene Aram,” and depict such realities as
            “The Song of a Shirt,” and “The Bridge of Sighs,” must
            have been formed in no common mould! He, too, is gone
            “home!”
         </p>
         
         <p>I remember the first time I met him was at one of the pleasant soirees of the painter Martin; for a moment I turned away
            —as many have done—disappointed, for the countenance, in
            repose, was of melancholy rather than of mirth: there was
            something calm, even to solemnity, in the upper portion of the
            face, which, in public, was seldom relieved by the eloquent
            play of the mouth, or the occasional sparkle of the observant
            eye; and it was a general remark among his acquaintances,
            that he was too quiet for “the world.” There are many witwatchers to be found in society, who think there is nothing in
            a man, unless, like a sounding-board, he make a great noise at
            a small touch,—who consider themselves aggrieved, unless an
            “author” open at once like a book, and speak as he writes;
            this vulgar notion, like others of the same stamp, creeps into
            good society, or that is so considered, and I have seen both
            Hook and Hood “set,” as a pointer sets a partridge, by persons who glitter in evanescent light simply by repeating what
            such men have said. Mr. Hook, perhaps, liked this celebrity
            —this setting and staring, this lion hunt—so different from the
            heart-worship paid to veritable greatness. Mr. Hood did not:
            he was too sensitive, too refined, to endure it; the dislike to
            being pointed at as the “man who was funny,” kept him out
            of a crowd, where there were always numbers who really honored his genius, and loved him for his gentle and domestic virtues. It was only among his friends that his playful fancy
            
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>flourished, or that he yielded to its influence; although, strictly speaking, “social” in all his feelings, he never sought to
            stimulate his wit by the false poison of draughts of wine; nor
            was he ever more cheerful than when at his own fireside he
            enjoyed the companionship of his dear and devoted wife. He
            was playful as a child; and his imagination, pure as bright, frolicked with nature, whom he loved too well ever to outrage or
            insult by slight or misrepresentation. And yet he was City
            born, and City bred,—born in the unpoetic district of “the
            Poultry;” though born as it were, to letters, for his father was
            a bookseller; and the son was remarkable for great vivacity of
            spirits, and prone to astonish good citizens, guests at his father’s, no less than his fellow-pupils when at school, by the
            shrewdness and brilliancy of his observations upon topics of
            which it was thought he knew nothing. He finished his education at Camberwell; and, even at that early age being in
            very precarious health, was advised to try the effects of a sea
            voyage upon his constitution. The sea suited him not. I can
            well imagine its boiling turbulence—its fitfulness—its glittering brightness, and its fearful storms finding no sympathy in
            the gentle bosom of the author of “The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies.”
         </p>
         
         <p>He passed some years, on his retnrn, with relatives in “Bonny Dundee and, manifesting a great talent for drawing, was
            apprenticed to his uncle, Mr. Robert Sands, an engraver. But
            he trifled with the pencil, while he labored with the pen; his
            future destiny was pointed out by the light of genius. And
            what rare talents did he not possess, blended with the gentleness and kindliness of the sweetest of poetic temperaments—
            how full his sympathies!—how honest his heart—how great
            and true in all things! Although his existence was a long disease rather than a life, he was free from all bitterness and
            harshness of spirit, feeling intensely for the sufferings of others; he was in every way unselfish; prone to the very last
            to turn his own sad sufferings into jests, and forcing those who
            wept over his agony, fierce as it was (until the last dull sleep
            which continued from the Tuesday to the Saturday of his
            death), to smile at the wittiness of his conceits, mingling as
            they did with a touching consciousness of his situation, and
            the solemn belief that hereafter which, in all faith and humility, we believe—to the full extent of knowledge—he now
            enjoys.
         </p>
         
         <p>But what a sad picture—and by no means a solitary one—
            do the last months of this great man’s life display!	“Tue
            Song of a Shirt” was knocking at every heart in Great Britain, while its author was panting for breath, and trying to enlist the forces of his friends in the launch of the Magazine that
            still bears his name. And his friends stood by him: they
            gathered willingly beneath the banner, which, had it been raised by a strong arm instead of one trembling with pain and the
            unsteadiness of departed health, would have battled the breeze
            nobly and waved for years triumphantly above—as a shelter
            to—his home. A little longer, and the difficulties of his position increased; one illness succeeded another, and “l’Envoi”
            to the end of each “periodical labor” induced the mingled
            smiles and tears of his admirers. He wrote wit while propped
            by pillows; and the chapters of a novel—doomed to remain,
            like his life, a great fragment—were produced between the intervals and beatings of heart disease.
         </p>
         
         <p>Alas! what those endure who write for bread! But it is
            all over with him now: the gold has been refined and the crucible is broken; the toilworn body has been bowed in death
            that the soul might escape into life; the mortal cerements have
            been burst; the winged child is borne into the true life—the
            life of eternity! Those who loved him best rejoice at his release from labor—never remunerated in proportion to the pleasure it gave—never in a way at all commensurate with the
            enormous profit it produced—seldom, perhaps, thought of by
            those whose hearts it opened. Latterly his dear friends had
            been agonized by his terrible lament, “I cannot die—I cannot
            die!” Such friends were thankful to lay him, on the 10th of
            May, in a calm grave at Kensall-green. It will not, we are
            sure, be long before a monument is raised to his memory; and
            there are hearts enough in England to remember that his widow and two children have but the hundred a year to subsist on
            —bestowed by Sir Robert Feel, whose letter, in words which
            did him honor, conveyed the request that he might be permitted to make the personal acquaintance of one whose works he
            had long admired and appreciated. In this generous wish and
            hope he was destined to be disappointed,—but
         </p>
         
         <p>Honor and glory to a great statesman with a good heart!
            Such men are worthy almoners of genius!

            <p>This is the production of a young American, who had the rare
               fortune to be present at the most marvellous occurrence of the
               19th century—the exhibition of the Holy Robe. In addition to a
               very graphic description of this extraordinary event, which, from
               the excitement it has created, seems destined to be an era in the
               Christian Church, this unpretending volume is replete with antiquarian lore, relating to the city of Charlemagne, from which the
               Pilgrimage” commences—the intermediate historic and poetic
               ground; and of the once renowned city of Treves, with which it
               closes. It is the work of a scholar, and cannot fail to enlist a profound interest.— Oswego Advertiser.

            <p>Mr. Prescott appears to possess almost every qualification for
               his task; he has a pure, simple, and eloquent style—a keen relish
               for the picturesque—a quick and discerning judgment of character,
               and a calm, generous, and enlightened spirit of philanthropy.
               There is no exaggeration in stating that his " Conquest of Mexico”
               contains most of the valuable qualities which distinguish the most
               popular historical writers in our language of the present day.
               It unites the chivalrous but truthful enthusiasm of Col. Napier, and
               the vivacity of the accomplished author of the “Siege of Granada,”
               with the patient and ample research of Mr. Tytler.—Edinburgh

            <p>It would be altogether supererogatory to make this celebrated
               work the subject of critical analysis, since it has so long been distinguished by the concurrent and enthusiastic applause of the
               whole reading community. We know of scarcely any other work
               so amusing, instructive, and powerfully attractive as the " History
               of Ferdinand and Isabella;” it possesses every charm which elegance of diction, gracefulness of style, and interest of subject can
               impart. In a word, it is such a production as could only have
               emanated from a mind richly stored with the wealth of sound
               learning, genius, and the felicitous art of its application.—N. Y.

            <p>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he
               has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old establishment in Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS
               published on the continent without the heavy expense attending their
               transmission through England. Each of these establishments will be
               conducted by one of his sons, under his own general superintendence.—
               This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage to his
               correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
               on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and
               small sums payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New-York. Two and a
               half percent will be allowed to all those who make a remittance with
               their orders.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years,
               possesses a knowledge of books and editions not often to be met with,
               and will be happy to give any advice and information respecting the formation of Libraries or Collections of Books in any particular branch of
               literature or science. For information in regard to his efficiency, he
               begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other literary characters in the United States, to whom he is known. Intending
               to devote the remainder of hie life to literary pursuits, his greatest pleasure will arise from sending rare and valuable books to his own country;
               and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States a Library
               which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
               he can live to say, “I also assisted IN its Formation,” his most ardent wishes will be gratified.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich has in press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova: a Catalogue of Books relating to America, including Voyages to the South
               Seas and round the World: Part III. from 1831 to 1845, with supplement

            <p>“Having seen, with much pleasure, a second edition, by your
               house, of “A Plain System of Elocution,” I beg leave to express
               to you my opinion of the high merit of that work.
            </p>
            
            <p>Its title is in keeping with the plan pursued in the book; a rare
               fact in this age of making many books. In the work may be found
               what this ago needs—a System of Elocution, that presents to the
               learner something tangible; and that combines meaning with
               beauty, and beauty with force.
            </p>
            
            <p>I hereby express the opinion that the Principals of Seminaries
               of Learning would benefit the department of Elocution, by the

               the public against a set of imposters who are calling upon our customers, asserting that they are engaged by us in the capacity of agents.
               In several instances they have succeeded in obtaining orders. But when
               the goods are delivered great dissatisfaction has been given by the infamous and utterly base imitations. But still persisting that the cards
               are our manufacture, they too often succeed in foisting them upon the
               unsuspecting. We ourselves would strenuously caution the said parties
               that, should they persist after this notice, we will try what effect a State
               Prison will have upon them. We are, Sir, Your most obt’y,

            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
               work yet published in this country. Where pupils have
               used this method, the most rapid advancement has been observed
               in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the
               lessons, exercises, scales and studies are given in such PROGRESsive order, that they enlist the interests of pupils, and carry them
               almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
               otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction
               books. The time has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the
               Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of such
               methods as Bertini's that pupils will be enabled to read music
               with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner;
               the rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same
               time, and each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the
               same page.

            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
               from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
               Bellini’s Method over all others yet published in this country,
               most of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will

      <div class="note" id="n001">By the way, I lately saw in the Southern Literary Messenger,
         a translation of what purported to be a newly discovered epithalamium attributed to Mimnermus. It has been copied through
         pardions newspapers, and I should much like to see the original.--
         Could you, Mr. Editor, manage to lay hold of the translator, and
         obtain from him the original, together with the proof of the iden-tity?

      <div class="note" id="n003">We think (with deference to Mr. Weiss’s more thorough knowledge of German) that individuality would better express the meaning here.  Eigenthum is the word in the original.</div>
