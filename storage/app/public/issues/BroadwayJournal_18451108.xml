         <p>It was twilight in the infernal regions. All was stillness in the Stygian palace, for Proserpina had not yet
            made her appearance from the chamber where she usually retired after dinner, to indulge herself in a siesta.
            Pluto had gone on a visit to Olympus to complain of sonic
            new Esculapius, and the scarcity of fresh arrivals in his
            dominions; for it was a subject of lamentation throughout Hell, that a full month had elapsed without any tribute money being paid to Charon, for carrying souls
            across the Hateful Passage. The old man was rheumatic from his long inactivity, and so cross, that nobody,save,
            his master, ventured to speak to him. The ill humor
            was so general that it extended to the royal abode; and
            even the sternly serene countenance of the monarch had
            Worn on his departure so black an expression that his attendants shrunk from his looks. He had gone without
            taking leave of his queen; indeed, it was said they were
            bot upon the most cordial terms; though the exact truth
            could not be ascertained, none venturing to interfere in
            his Majesty’s domestic affairs. The infernal courtiers
            were scattered here and there about the palace; some
            playing at domestic, smoking their pipes under the shadow of the huge cypresses that hung their mournful
            wreaths from the columns of the porticoes; others reading the newspapers by the expiring light, or stretched
            in listless ease along the black marble benches. Three
            dark figures were pacing the long gravel walks, wrapped
            in their cloaks, with their eyes fixed on the ground.—
            These were the Eumcnides, and they seemed too deeply
            absorbed for conversation. The only interruption to the
            silence was the heavy and continuous roaring of Cocy
            tus, as his black waves rolled gloomily on, to unite themselves with the vast channel of Acheron; and the crackling heard from Phlegethon, as occasionally shoots of
            flame illuminated the increasing darkness. Now and
            then, too, Cerberus, who lay slumbering on the river-side,
            would lift up one of his three heads, and utter a low, lazy growl at the sound of some fancied footstep. Then
            he would shake his three pair of ears, and compose himself again to sleep.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I can play no more,” said one of the gamesters, rising from his seat. “It is too dark to distinguish the
            points.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nay, friend,” returned the winner, “one stake more.
            I will risk ten to one we have new arrivals to-night.—
            There is a plague raging in Thessaly.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“And what of that? What is the World coming to?
            A plague—and does not Jove send an antidote to every
            poison? The shears of Atropos will rust for want of
            usage. Look—the poor thing is ready to expire with
            ennui!”
         </p>
         
         <p>The figure he pointed out was sitting in a melancholy
            posture, under one of the pillars of the infernal throne.
            One hand supported her head; its marble whiteness
            strangely contrasted with her raven tresses and black
            robes—and the other, hanging negligently at her side,
            held the fatal scissors.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a sudden stir among the attendants, and
            Proserpina herself appeared. Her stately figure was enveloped in the imperial robes worn on state occasions,
            and a gorgeous crown was upon her head. She moved
            with divine majesty, attended, but not supported, by her
            favorite hand-maidens, and bending a haughty glance upon the awed group before her, paused ere she ascended
            the seat of sovereignty. Her voice, when she spoke, was
            like the murmur of falling waters.
         </p>
         
         <p>“How now—Tyche! why are not the lamps lighted?
            For what have you the charge of our palace?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“So please your Majesty, Tisiphone’s last draught of
            oil for the uses of Tartarus, exhausted our present store.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Do your duty, sir, and trouble me no more with thy
            presence. Are we to receive company in darkness?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I did not know your Majesty expected company,”
            ventured her favorite maiden.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Certainly: thou knowest to-night is the anniversary
            of my coronation. I have ordered supper in the great
            hall; and---–”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Alas, dear mistress,” said the maiden, putting her
            handkerchief to her eyes—“is it not rather an occasion
            for mourning?—Can you have forgotten the lovely vale
            of Enna, and our blithe garlands, and pastoral songs—
            and the birth-day gifts of Ceres? When shall we be so
            happy again? Oh that fatal pomegranate!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Have done with your whining nonsense, Cyane,” cried
            the Queen, angrily; “or by my father Jupiter, and my
            mother Ceres, and my grandmother Vesta, I will send
            you to keep company with the trees and fountains—that
            may reply to your wailings—if you so much as name
            Sicily to me again!” But when the favorite pressed
            more closely to tile side of her mistress, and looked up
            tenderly and tearfully in her face, and dropped her eyes
            on the ground, as if afraid of her displeasure, the Queen
            put her arm around her affectionately, and spoke more
            mildly.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nay, good Cyane, take it not so to heart. Come—I
            will tell you a secret”; and she bent her lips to the maiden’s ear. “A youth will join us to-night, whose beauty
            would make jealous our brother Apollo.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Cyane once more dropped her eyes on the ground.</p>
         
         <p>“He is to be my cup-bearer. Shall I not equal the
            Olympian Juno? It is Admetus, King of Thessaly, whom
            the Fates this night conduct to my realm. We will be
            magnificent, though my lord be in heaven. But the hour
            is come.” And she took out her gold repeater, which
            rang nine clear strokes.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Atropos, my girl, you are dull to-night.” Atropos
            lifted up her head with a melancholy smile. The shears
            were half open.
         </p>
         
         <p>Then a tumult was heard at the gates. They were
            shaken with long and loud clamor, and the sound of many voices. The palace slaves ran hither and thither, to
            find out the meaning of the confusion, and Cerberus sent
            up a triple yell, that might have frightened Rhadamanthus himself. The portals burst open with a thunderous
            crash, and Pluto’s outriders entered helter skelter.
         </p>
         
         <p>“What is all this?” cried Proserpina, forcing composure, as she sate upon her throne, beating rapidly her
            cushioned footstool with her little feet, in impatience at
            the unwonted disorder. “Is Tartarus let loose?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nay, your highness!” said a knight, throwing himself from his horse, and kneeling on one knee at her august feet—“only Pluto is coming back.”</p>
         
         <p>“Pluto coming back!” exclaimed the queen; and she
            gave Cyane a pinch that made the poor girl’s arm black
            and blue. “What, in Jove’s name, is the matter?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No matter at all, your Majesty. But Nycteus, one
            of the four black royal steeds, has cast a shoe, and our
            master has ordered him to Lemnos, that Vulcan may repair the damage. But here comes the king.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Pluto stared as he saw the saloon illuminated with
            wax tapers, and his spouse arrayed in gorgeous apparel.
            He even stopped, as he came near, and his brow gathered blackness.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah, truant!” exclaimed Proserpina, throwing her
            scarf gracefully back, and extending her white hand—
            “can nought but mischance bring thee to my side? And
            on the anniversary of our wedding, too! We must grace
            the occasion with a little splendor, though sooth, my
            heart is always heavy enough, having so oft to count, in
            loneliness and sadness, the hours of thy absence!” And
            she averted her face, and covered her dark eyes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Pluto’s nature was stubborn, but he never could abide
            the sight of a woman’s tears. All he shed were iron;
            and there was something in the softness of liquid sorrow
            that melted his very soul. So he applied himself to
            sooth his aggrieved wife; wiped her eyes with her cambric handkerchief, and promised, on the honor of a king,
            never to swerve from his affection to her.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Cheer up, my flower! we must have no tears on our
            wedding day. Cheer up!—Look—there is some one, as
            I live! in Charon’s barge!”
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a general rush of expectation, and all eyes
            were directed to the boat, as it came slowly across the
            dark waters. Proserpina's heart beat almost audibly.—
            The barge touched the hither strand and two figures appeared, marshalled by the sullen oarsman. They landed, and one advanced. It was a youth, of perfect figure,
            and face that shamed the morning. Pluto saw that he
            stopped not to pay his fare,and his suspicions were again
            excited.
         </p>
         
         <p> "This is your solitude,” said he to his lady wife.—
            “Yon fair stripling, it seems, had your previous warrant to pass. Pray, what is his business here?”
         </p>
         
         <p>Proserpina trembled, but she was too proud to show
            fear. “I have destined him to an office in my household”—she answered, boldly.
         </p>
         
         <p>“And what, if I may ask?”</p>
         
         <p>“My cup-bearer.”</p>
         
         <p>“Your cup-bearer! You must ape the deities of heaven in all their absurd follies? Out upon you!” cried the
            monarch, as he stamped his foot; the blow shook the
            foundations of hell and of the earth; the tides of ocean
            receded, and the inhabitants of Sicily recorded another
            earthquake.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Oh, Pluto! a truce to your stuff!” gaily answered
            the queen, in a voice of music that penetrated the recesses of Erebus. “Have done with your folly, and receive your visitor. See you not, it is Mercury?"
         </p>
         
         <p>The black haired king had already perceived his mistake, and felt ashamed of his violence, as the beautiful
            stranger approached. The wings attached to his helmet
            and sandals, and the wings upon his wand of gold entwined with emerald serpents, denoted the messenger of
            Jove. The sword by which Argus fell was girt to his
            side, and a lyre hung neglected over his shoulders, half
            covered by his profusion of bright golden curls. His eye
            was clear and piercing, and his step light and swift as
            he drew nigh the throne. He bowed gracefully to Pluto,
            kissed the fair hand of Proserpina, and hoped he found
            his kinswoman in good health.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Apollo sends your highness this, with his compliments,” said the youthful deity, presenting the queen a
            rose-colored note, perfumed and sealed with red wax.—
            Then he turned to Pluto—and they were soon deep in the
            discussion of the politics of heaven, and the gossip of
            the court of Jove. Proserpina turned aside to read the
            note.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lo, Cyane!” cried she, reddening with vexation,—
            “Apollo has the insolence to propose me a substitute for
            Admetus! Heard you ever the like! The Farcer, he says,
            have promised to excuse the Prince’s death, provided
            some voluntary victim can be found to fill his place!—
            They think to pass his wife upon me! But I will send
            her back to him—that I will! They might have asked
            my leave!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What is the matter?” cried Pluto, seeing the distur-
            bance of his spouse.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Summon hither yon shivering ghost,” said Proserpina angrily—for once taking no heed of her lord. "I
            would see who has had the courage to brave my presence
            uncalled!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Mercury stepped back, and beckoned his companion to
            the foot of the throne. Slowly and timidly the shade
            approached, gliding through a throng of attendants eager for a glance at the new comer. It stopped at some
            distance from the Stygian sovereigns.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come nearer,” said the empress of the dead in a
            softer tone, “and doff thy mantle.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The spirit obeyed; and the shroud falling, revealed a
            countenance and form of transcendant loveliness. The
            face was passing pale, and the calm passionless eyes
            were unshadowed by thought or emotion; nor moved the
            long fair locks that hung from the clear temples, with
            the breath from the colorless lips. It stood motionless,
            yet quivering, like the shadow of some beautiful statue,
            seen in the trembling pool.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Now by the helmet of the Cyclops,” exclaimed Pluto, gazing upon the vision—“it is a lovely one! Whom
            have you brought us, Mercury?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is the bride of Thessaly. She dies in her husband’s 
            stead, who lives for having sheltered Phosbus,” answered
            Mercury, hesitating a little, for he was too much given
            to lying not to find difficulty in speaking the truth.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Thessaly was a fool to part with her,” said the god.</p>
         
         <p>“But she shall fare bravely. Here, some of you, give
            her in charge to Eacus. She shall become one of us.—
            So, my love, you never told me it was a lady cup-bearer
            you expected. That was quite a different affair. How
            could you sport with my fondness? Fie—Proserpina!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“And fie, Pluto! to frown upon one who shares thy
            throne. Verily, thou art quicker to suspicion than to
            aught else; whereas, in aught that concerns thy consort,
            as Hamlet says,
         </p>
         
         <p>Duller shouldst thou be, than the fat weed
            That roots itself at ease on Lethe wharf.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I say Amen to that!” said Mercury, who always took
            part with the ladies. Down, vile cur! I wish, good
            kinsman, you would teach this dog of yours better manners! Here he has daubed my court dress with the mud
            of the Acherusian fen! Down with you, fellow!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Cerberus burst into a yell of agony, and retreated towards his master, with his three heads stooped to the
            ground, and his immense bushy tail sweeping the floor
            behind him. The cause of his alarm was soon apparent.
            A brawny figure was seen halfway across the river of
            hell, grasping Charon’s two ears, and urging the bark
            onward with incredible speed. The sullen old man was
            swearing lustily at being compelled to play the part of
            an idle passenger in his own boat, which shot over the
            waters with such swiftness as to curl the sluggish wave,
            and leave a wake of foam. It touched the side; the figure leaped on shore, bestowed a hearty box upon the
            ferryman, and pursued by his execrations, entered the
            imperial palace, and strode into the presence.
         </p>
         
         <p>“You are welcome, Hercules,” said the queen, who
            was first to recover from her surprise. “You are welcome
            to our court. How goes on the earth?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Not quite well, your highness,” answered the son of
            Alcmena, saluting Pluto and the winged deity—“else I
            had not come hither to complain. How do you do, my
            pretty Cyane?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is long”—said Pluto, civily—“since we last greet-
            ed you in the shades.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“And then my errand was no peaceful one. Be quiet,
            monster!" The hound had crouched for protection under the chairs, and was growling with fear and rage.—
            Thou need’st not again dread the upper air. Earth had
            enough of thee on thy last visit.––But to the point: I
            come to ask a dear boon of your highness.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What boon shall the mighty Alcides ask, that I will
            not grant?’’ cried the Stygian Juno.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Trust my well known generosity,” said Pluto.</p>
         
         <p>“I thank your graces both,” answered Hercules, taking snuff; “and will unfold my business. The youthful
            consort of Admetus has just passed into your dominions.
            Her lord, frantic at her loss, is almost expiring with
            grief. Moved by the sight of his woe, I hare sworn,
            by immortal Jove, to implore at your hands the lost Alcestis. Let me conduct her back to earth. Seal your
            empire over the world by one great act of clemency, and
            make happy two faithful lovers by restoring them to
            each other.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Pluto and Proserpina looked at each other while the
            son of Alcmena spoke. Images of felicity and blighted
            affection, and restored happiness, flitted before their fancy. The queen thought of the bright fields of Enna, and
            her youthful companions, and her shepherd lovers; and
            the monarch thought of his bride in her earth-born beauty, and her charming bashfulness, and his swift chariot,
            and the Cecropian cave. As for Mercury, he was too
            well bred to interpose in a delicate matter. So he turned on his heel, and whistled “Zip Coon.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Do it”—whispered Hercules in the ear of his majesty—“and I will send you Diomedes and his horses.”</p>
         
         <p>“I have no objection,” said Proserpina, putting up her
            lip.
         </p>
         
         <p>“This must be thought of,” at length replied the king
            of Hades. “It is no easy matter to reverse the decree of
            fate.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I have the lady on my side”—muttered Hercules, glancing at the queen.</p>
         
         <p>“Well, that is half the battle,” said Pluto. “In the
            mean time, you must sup with us, my good lad. This,
            you know, is our wedding day; and Proserpina has devised a little party, and a dance, and so forth—having
            bespoken Orpheus himself for her fiddler. So come along;
            give Madame your arm. Mercury, we should be happy
            of your company; but I see you are in haste, therefore
            will not detain you from your ambrosia and nectar on
            Olympus. Make my compliments to Jupiter and the ladies. Come on, Alcides.”
         </p>
         
         <p>******</p>
         
         <p>Thrice had the hours on the Thessalian plain measured the westering sun; the growing shade upon the dial’s changing plate in vain had warned the shepherd;
            matron, youth and maid and gray-haired sire poured from
            the city’s breast, where every toil for a brief space had
            rest. They came to pay the last funereal rite to their
            lost queen. Upon the bier she lay, lovely in death; her
            shrouded face more white than e’er the royal rose.––
            Along the way that led to Pluto’s temple, on the ground
            were scattered cypress boughs; and far around the hands
            of pious friends scattered buds. Within the hallowed
            fane the victims stood—three sable bulls; their brows
            with cypress crowned, and adianthus, and the daffodil,
            mingling their modest hues and sad perfume, sacred to
            him who rules beyond the tomb.
         </p>
         
         <p>Thrice had the priest invoked the sacred Nine, and
            thrice relumed the flame of sacrifice that burnt before
            the shrine. Then lifting high the knife, “This hand of
            mine,” he cried, “dread Pluto, that devotes to thee this
            offering (oh, accepted may it be!) was never stained with crime! So thou receive the sacrifice. Immortal Proserpina! In thy rich favor to the lost one give a
            glorious doom in the Elysian plains! And grant where
            now keen anguish only reigns in our Admetus’ breast,
            the peace divine of pious recognition may abide, serene
            as hers who for her consort died!”
         </p>
         
         <p>He entered, and the weeping train came nigh; with
            sighs suppressed in vain, the hoary Pheres and Clymene
            with her sad veiled brow, were seen. Bereaved Admetus, lifting inwards the skies his clasped beseeching
            hands; with sympathizing woe the pious youths their
            king surround, with flowing locks, and eyes that seek the
            ground.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lo!” cried tire priest; “is there not one of all who
            silent stand by this untimely pall, to tell her praises who
            thus coldly lies the bride of death?” He said; with kindly eyes a youth stepped forth; grasping the rural lyre,
            to sing with trembling lips and heart on fire.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Gracious Apollo I invoke; and thee, first of the
            Nine, renowned Calliope! who sit’st in splendor on the
            mountain height where soar the swans, with crest of
            glancing light, that yet beside the Heliconian spring
            curve the proud neck and fold the sounding wing. Assist my lyre, for now I boldly sing of worth might ask
            its music, were my tongue hallowed as his with whom
            Olympus rung.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Noble she was—and fair; with beauty crowned such
            as the Cyprian queen, of charms renowned, would know
            surpassed her own. Why, Parcæ, why doomed ye such
            matchless loveliness to die? Hid Pluto claim from earth
            another bride? or would the queen of shades in envy
            hide such beauty from the world? For never yet hath
            he whose oar doth rule the Stygian tide, on his black
            shores so pure a spirit met!
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why did the scythe of death strike down the flower
            scarce opened to the sun? Age hath its hour to fade and
            fall; the bleak north wind doth spare the gentle stalk to
            sweep in ruin bare the mountain-cresting oak. The tender vine sees not its blossoms ere their fruit decline; nor
            doth their mother earth untimely mourn the blighted buds
            her genial breast had borne to gladsome summer. Couldst
            thou not, O, Death! hare won some elder prey whose failing breath might have redeemed thy victim?
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lo! how wail her babes their mother lost! the youthful train of matrons ask her, and the sylvan vale whose
            haunt she loved, and the luxuriant plain. Ye, who adored
            her, breathe the last fond sigh o’er her fair corse! Clouds,
            weep your tributes here! Sun, veil thy splendors. Pitying
            winds, reply! sweep a sad requiem o’er Alcestis’ bier!
         </p>
         
         <p>“Hide the pale cold face forever from the gaze of her
            lord, and remove the corse into the temple. Let her be
            entombed in holy ground. Follow her, comrades, and
            chant with me the solemn death song. Let the virtues
            of the lost one be the theme of the last lay her parting
            spirit hears."

            place in the world is—or, alas, urns—the Dutch borough
            of Vondervotteimittiss. Yet, as it lies some distance
            from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat out of
            the way situation, there are, perhaps, very few of my
            readers who have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of
            those who have not, therefore, it will be only proper that
            I should enter into some account of it. And this is, indeed, the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting
            public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design
            here to give a history of the calamitous events which
            have so lately occurred within its limits. No one who
            knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed will

         <p>By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am enabled to say, positively, that the borough
            of Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves.
            Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which
            mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up with in
            certain algebraic formulae. The date, I may thus say, in
            regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less
            than any assignable quantity whatsoever.
         </p>
         
         <p>Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittis, I confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault.—
            Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point,
            some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the reverse,
            I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered
            satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg, nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey, is to be cautiously 
            preferred. It runs:—“Vondcrvottcimittis—Vonder, lege
            Dander—Vottcimittis, quasi und Blcitziz—Bleitztz obsol:
            pro Blitzcn.” This derivation, to say the truth, is still
            countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident
            on the summit of the steeple of the House of the TownCouncil. I do not choose, however, to commit myself
            on a theme of such importance, and must refer the reader
            desirous of information, to the “Oratiunculae de Rebus
            Praeter-Vetens," of Dundergutz. See, also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus," pp. 27 to 5010, Folio Gothic
            edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;—wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of
            Gruntundguzzell.
         </p>
         
         <p>Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the
            date of the foundation of Voudervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch.
            The oldest man in the borough can remember not the
            slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of
            it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility
            is considered an insult. The site of the village is in a
            perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over
            whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass.
            For this they assign the very good reason that they do
            not believe there is anything at all on the other side.
         </p>
         
         <p>Round the skirts of the valley, (which is quite level,
            and paved throughout with Hat tiles.) extends a continu
            ous row of sixty little houses. These, having their backs
            on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of the
            plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each
            dwelling. Every house has a small garden before it,
            with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely alike,
            that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.
            Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is
            somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned
            little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the walls look
            like a chess-board upon a great scale. The gables are
            turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all
            the rest of the house, over the eaves and over the main
            doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with very
            tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a
            vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout, is of a dark hue, and there is much
             carving about it, with but a trilling variety of pattern;
             for, time out of mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittis
            have never been able to carve more than two objects—
            a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity,
            wherever they find room for the chisel.
         </p>
         
         <p>The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the
             furniture is all upon one plan. The floors are of square
             tiles, the chairs and tables of black-looking wood with
            thin crooked legs and puppy feet. The mantle-pieces
            are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and
            cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real time-piece,
            which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the mid dle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on
            each extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the time-piece again, is a little china man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it, through
            which is seen the dial-plate of a watch.
         </p>
         
         <p>The fire-places are large and deep, with fierce crookedlooking fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and
            a huge pot over it full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which
            the good woman of the house is always busy in attending,
            She is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face,
            and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with
            purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey made very full behind and very short
            in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects, not
            reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair
            of green stockings to cover them. Her shoes, of pink
            leather, are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons
            puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In her left hand
            she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she
            wields a ladle for the sauer-kraut and pork. By her side
            there stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy repeater tied
            to its tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way
            of a quiz.
         </p>
         
         <p>The boys themselves arc, all three of them, in the garden attending the pig. They are each two feet in height.
            They have three-cornered cocked hats, purple waiscoats
            reaching down to their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red
            woollen stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles,
            and long surtout coats with large buttons of mother-ofpearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little
            dumpy watch in. his right hand. He takes a puff and a
            look, and then a look and a-puff. The pig, which is corpulent and lazy, is occupied now in picking up the stray
            leaves that fall from the cabbages, and now in giving a
            kiek behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins have
            also tied to his tail, in order to make him look as handsome as the cat.
         </p>
         
         <p>Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like
            the tables, is seated the old man of the house himself.—
            He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with big
            circular eyes and a huge double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys, and I need say nothing farther
            about it. All the difference is that his pipe is somewhat
            bigger than theirs, and he can make a greater smoke.—
            Like them, he has a watch, but be carries his watch in
            his pocket. To say the truth, he has something of more
            importance than a watch to attend to, and what that is I
            shall presently explain. He sits with his right leg upon
            his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always
            keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.
         </p>
         
         <p>This object is situated in the steeple of the House of
            the Town-Council. The Town-Council are all very little, round, oily, intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and
            fat double chins, and hare their coats much longer and
            their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my sojourn in the
            borough they have had several special meetings, and have
            adopted these three important resolutions:
         </p>
         
         <p>“That it is wrong to alter the good old course of
            things”—
         </p>
         
         <p>“That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss”—and</p>
         
         <p>“That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”</p>
         
         <p>Above the session room of the Council is the steeple,
            and in the steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the borough of Vondervotteiinittiss. And this is the object to which the eyes of the old
            gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather-bottomed
            arm chairs.
         </p>
         
         <p>The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the 
            seven sides of the steeples—so that it can be readily seen 
            from all quarters. Its faces are large and white, and its
            bands heavy and black. There is a belfry-man whose 
            sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most perfeet of sinecures, for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was
            never yet known to have anything the matter with it.—
            Until lately the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of antiquity
            to which the archives have reference, the hours have
            been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed, the
            case was just the same with all the other clocks and
            watches in the borough. Never was such a place for
            keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought
            proper to say “twelve o’clock!” all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded
            like a very echo. In short the good burghers were fond
            of their sauer-kraut, bat then they were proud of their
            clocks.
         </p>
         
         <p>All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more
            or less respect, and as the belfry-man of Vondervotteimittis has the most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world. He is the chief
            dignitary of the borough, and the very pigs look up to
            him with a sentiment of reverence. His coat-tail is very
            far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his eyes, and his
            stomach, very far bigger than those of any other old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only
            double but triple.
         </p>
         
         <p>I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteim
            ittiss; alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience
            a reverse!
         </p>
         
         <p>There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants that “no good can come from over the hills,” and it
            really seemed that the words had in them something of
            the spirit of prophecy. It wanted five minutes of noon,
            on the day day before yesterday, when there appeared a
            very odd-looking object on the summit of the ridge to the
            eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat
            in a leather-bottomed arm-chair, turned one of his eyes
            with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple.
         </p>
         
         <p>By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon,
            the droll object in question was perceived to be a very
            diminutive foreign-looking young man. He descended
            the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a
            good look at him. He was really the most finnicky little
            personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimitiss.
            His countenance was of a dark snuff colour, and he had
            a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of
            displaying, as he was grinning from ear to car. What
            with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest
            of his face to be seen. His head was uncovered,and his hair
            neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting
            swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets
            dangled a vast length of white handkerchief,) black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon lor
            bows. Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras,
            and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big
            as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from
            which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner
            of fantastical steps, he took snuff incessantly with an
            air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless
            me! here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!
         </p>
         
         <p>To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he
            curvetted right into the village, the odd stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion, and many
            a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a
            trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief
            which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous
            indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he
            cut a fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem
            to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing
            as keeping time in his steps.
         </p>
         
         <p>The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance,
            however, to get their eyes thoroughly open, when,
            just as it wanted half a minute of noon, the rascal bounc ed, as I say, right into the midst of them; gave a chassez
            here and a balancez there; and then, after a pirouette
            and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up into
            the belfry of the house of the Town-Council, where the
            wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at once
            by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big
            chapeau-de-bras upon his head; knocked it down over his
            eyes and month; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat
            him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the
            belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow,
            you would have sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the devil’s tattoo up in the
            belfry of the steeple of Voudervoueimittiss.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance
            this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the important fact that it now wanted only
            half a second of noon. The bell was about to strike, and
            it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity
            that every body should look well at his watch. It was
            evident, however, that just at this moment, the fellow in
            the steeple was doing something that he had no business
            to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, no
            body had any time to attend to his manoeuvres, for they
            had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded.
         </p>
         
         <p>“One!” said the clock.</p>
         
         <p>"Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every
            leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss.—
            “Von!” said his watch also; “von!” said the watch of
            his vrow, and “von!” said the watches of the boys, and
            the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Two!” continued the big bell; and</p>
         
         <p>“Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.</p>
         
         <p>“Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine!
            Ten!” said the bell.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin!
            Den!” answered the others.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Eleven!” said the big one.</p>
         
         <p>“Eleben!” assented the little fellows.</p>
         
         <p>“Twelve!” said the bell.</p>
         
         <p>“Dvelf!" they replied, perfectly satisfied, and dropping
            their voices,
         </p>
         
         <p>“Und dvelf it iss!” said all the little old gentlemen,
            putting up their watches. But the big bell had not done
            with them yet.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Thirteen!" said he.</p>
         
         <p>"Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning
            pale, dropping their pipes, and putting down all their
            right legs from over their left knees.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—
            Mein Gott, it is—it is Dirteen o’clcck!!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar.</p>
         
         <p>“Vot is cura’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys,—
            "I’ve been ongry for dis hour!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Vot is cum’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows,
            “It has been done to rags for dis hour!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old
            gentlemen, “Donder and Blitzen! it has been smoked
            out for dis hour!”—and they filled them up again in a
            a great rage, and, sinking back in their arm chairs, puffed
            away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was
            immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face,
            and it seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of everything in the shape of a time-piece. The
            clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if
            bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could
            scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.—
            But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could
            put up any longer with the Behaviour of the little repeatera tied to their tails, and resented it by scampering all
            over the place, scratching and poking, and squeaking
            and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and running under the petticoats of
            the people, and creating altogether the most abominable
            din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters still
            more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the
            steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost.—
            Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the
            scoundrel through the smoke. There lie sat in the belfry
            upon the belfry-man, who Was lying flat upon his back.
            In his teeth the villain held the hell-rope, which he kept
            jerking about with his head, raising such a clatter that my
            ears ring again even to think of it. On his lap lay the

            <br></br>But different bosoms burn with different fires:—
            
            <br></br>One, simply wrong, a single thought misleads;
            
            <br></br>Another ten, another twenty needs,

            <br></br>But like Briareus, ’t had a hundred hands,
            
            <br></br>By which it delved within the social mind,
            
            <br></br>To make it turbid, dreamy, dull and blind;

            <br></br>A better prophet! So his followers thought;–
            
            <br></br>Gills, visions, fiats, were in all he wrought,
            
            <br></br>And much he wrought, and many a vision tried,
            
            <br></br>Since erst he dug upon Cumorah’s side.

            <br></br>"Hath lost, through erring men, its germ and pith;
            
            <br></br>And, viewed in every varying Christian creed,
            
            <br></br>Is bat a hollow, traitless, sapless reed;
            
            <br></br>All virtue gone—priests, pastors, churches, men,
            
            <br></br>Bishop and layman, sermon, book, and pen,
            
            <br></br>All that conspires to raise the system broad,

            <p>We have been much interested in this volume, and
               shall take occasion to speak of it folly hereafter:—at
               present it can hardly be considered as before the public.

               as an Autobiography of the Scnlptor—with a History of
               his Life and Works”—Tuckerman’s Letter on the

            <p>A Complete System of Latin Prosody, for the use of
               Schools, Colleges, and Private Learners; on a plan
               entirely New. By Patrick S; Casserly, formerly Principal of the Chrestomathic Institutions, etc. etc, NewYork: Casserly &amp; Sons, 108 Nassau St.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Casserly has acquired a deserved reputation as a
               teacher, and as the literal translator of Longinus—also
               by his Jacob’s “Greek Reader.” He is undoubtedly one
               of our best scholars, and the volume before us will do
               him infinite credit. Its comprehensiveness is especially
               notables but the author is sadly in error, we think, in
               supposing that Latin Prosody, any more than Latin Syntax, can be best studied in Latin rules. We are glad to
               find that he has not carried his system so far as to exclude the use of English rules, for those who prefer them.
               His Latin Hexameters are translated. The volume is,
               in general, accurately printed, but has some errors—vide
               p. 13. 1. 7.

            <div class="biblPage">275</div>  
            
            <p>Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, for November, opens with
               an admirable paper, by C. Fenno Hoffman, on “The Poetry of Trade.” Its second article is from the pen of H.
               Middleton Jr. of S. C., and is Chapter IV. of the thoughtful series of essays on “The Government and the Currency,” which have done so much for the character of
               the Magazine. Nothing so good, on the same subjects,
               has as yet appeared in America. The other papers are
               “Trade and Commerce of Mobile”; “The First Coal
               Region of Pennsylvania”; “What is a Revenue Tariff?”;
               “Maritime Law—No. 8”; and “Railroad Movement in
               Virginia.” The last article is especially important and
               interesting. The usual “Commercial Chronicle,” Statistics, and Book Criticisms, fill up the number, which
               altogether is one of the best yet issued.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of the editor of “The Merchant’s Magazine” we have
               more than once expressed our opinion—that he is one of
               the most remarkable men of his day; and we have now
               lying by us an article from the pen of Willis which
               speaks very much to the same purpose. There is not
               one of our readers who will not forgive us for quoting it:
            </p>
            
            <p>Hunt has been glorified in the Hong-kong Gazette, is regularly
               complimented by the English mercantile authorities, has every
               Banker in the world lor an eager subscriber, every Consul, every
               Ship-owner, and Navigator—is filed away as authority in every
               library, and thought of, in hall the countries of the world, as early
               as No. 3, in their enumeration of distinguished Americans—yet,
               who seeks to do him honor in the city he does honor to? The
               Merchant’s Magazine, though a prodigy of perseverance and industry, is not an accidental developement of Hunt’s energies He
               has always been singularly sagacious and original in devising new
               works and good ones. He was the founder of the first ‘Ladies'
               Magazine,’ of the first ‘Children’s Periodical,’ he started the
                American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge,’
               compiled the best known collection of American Anecdotes, and
               is an indefatigable writer—the author, among other things, of
               ‘Letters about the Hudson.’ A mutual Inend of Hunt and ourself
               says of him:—‘His most important labor was the projection and
               successful establishment of the ‘Merchant’s Magazine and Commercial Re-view.’ Having had the means of ascertaining the precise wants of the commercial public, and knowing that almost every other class of our population possessed its appropriate work, he
               conceived that a magazine and review, devoid to the interests of
               that large, wealthy, and respectable class, the merchants—a work
               which should be thoroughly practical and national in its character,
               embodying commercial matter, literary and statistical, having a
               national bearing upon their interests and intelligence, and supported by ripe and disciplined minds, would be a desideratum. This
               national work, tending to inform us of the causes which bad acted
               upon our trade and commerce in times past, and the expanding
               growth of our country, he has at length brought out with full success. In his periodical he has opened a new vein of thought, especially adapted to the peculiar cast of our American minds, and
               erected a monument which will endure.’
            </p>
            
            <p>Hunt was a playfellow of ours in round-jacket days, and we
               have always looked at him with a reminiscent interest. His luminous eager eyes, as he goes along the street keenly bent on his
               errand, would impress any observer with an idea of his genius and
               determination, and we think it is quite time his earnest head was
               in the engraver’s hand, and his daily passing-by, a mark for the
               digito monstrari. Few more valuable or more note-worthy citizens
               arc among us.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The Merchant’s Magazine” was, indeed, one of those
               “happy ideas,” as they are weakly termed, which enter
               the heads of men of genius alone. The execution of the
               scheme was not less happy than its conception. At the
               time, Mr. H. had not only not a dollar, but was much involved. His friends (?) too discouraged him - as friends
               in such cases always do. He persevered; made personal
               application to those who would understand and appreciate his enterprize; suffered no labor nor repulse to deter
               him; and in the end (without embarrassing himself with
               a partner) succeeded in establishing on the firmest
               basis a Magazine, which, independently of its literary, or commercial utility, is decidedly the best property
               of any similar journal in the world.

            <p>The American Review, for November, commences with
               an able paper on “Human Rights”—a review of Hurlbut’s Essay—continued from last number. We note, also,
               an excellent article on “The French Moralists—Labruyerc, Montaigne and Nicole,” also, a continuation of
               the spicy “Adventures on the Frontiers of Texas and
               Mexico.” There are several other excellent contributions

               work wa3, at one time, respectable. We should regret,
               for the sake of New York literature, that a journal of
               this kind should perish, and through sheer imbecility on
               the part of its conductors. Its present circulation, we
               believe, is not more than 1400 at the most. Its friends
               should come to its rescue.

         <p>Under this head we have very little to observe. Titian’s Venus—concerning which we had some remarks in
            a previous number—is again being exhibited in Broadway. Its authenticity, we believe, is sufficiently well
            established—but we cannot force ourselves into any very
            enthusiastic admiration of the work. As a composition
            it is full of defects. Its color alone redeems it.

         <p>At the rooms of the Art Union there are two very ex
            quisite landscapes by Shaw—an artist whose merits (all
            of the loftiest order) will perhaps never be appreciated
             by his countrymen, until Death has mellowed down some
            of the personal ill-will with which his brother artists regard him. His mannerisms (sufficiently obvious) affect
            only the aggregate of his pictures. Individually, nothing can surpass some of his best works—“The Indian’s
            First sight of a Ship,” for example.

         <p>Bust of Mr. Calhoun.—Mr. Clark Mills, a native artist,
            whose busts in plaster, actually moulded on the human head
            and face, have excited such general admiration, by their truth
            to life, has recently, as we predicted on a former occasion, made a
            successful attempt in a higher branch of art. From a block of
            native white free-stone, procured near Columbia in this Slate, he
            has sculptnred, with hammer and chisel, a stone bust of the great
            Southern Statesman, (his first attempt in this line,) in a manner
            that speaks well for the skill and taste of the artist. We propose
            that, when completed and approved, the City Council of Charleston should make public property of this likeness of our great native state-man, hewn, by a native artist, cut of a block of native
            stone.—Charleston Cour.

            previous, Claude Melnotte to an excellent house. These
            personations have not dimished the young actor’s hold on
            the public favor; tin y have in some respects strengthened it, and increased confidence in the extent and variety of his power. His Macbeth was regarded by many
            as his best performance, although for our own part, we
            prefer his Othello in the closing act, and various passages of great effect in his Claude Melnotte. In all the
            range of the drama there is scarcely a part more arduous than that of Macbeth; requiring as it does a constantly sustained power, an aspect of dread and supernatural soliciting, and the continuous expression of a spirit
            deepening on in crime, wracked with keen agonies at
            every step, to the end. Through this severe labour, Mr.
            Murdoch made his way, triumphantly: better in some
            parts than in others; lingering a little by the way in the
            intervals of the greater outbreaks of passion, and not
            always keeping himself as close to the work as he should:
            failing to intensify each lineament and feature—but leaving in the mind, withal, a conviction that the whole had
            been successfully accomplished, by an artist of a high
            order of merit. The admirable feeling and expression in
            the delivery of some portions of the play we can never
            forget. His ‘Wake Duncan with your knocking:' his
            heart-broken farewell to ‘Sleep’: his expression of countenance in the dagger-scene, and the magnificent, rolling
            tones of his voice in The multitudinous seas incarnadine’ are a part of memory itself.
         </p>
         
         <p>In Claude Melnotte his description of the palace on
            the lake of Como was a master-piece of recitation; his
            parting with Pauline, for the army, perfect in the voice
            with which he gave it, the gesture that accompanied it,
            and the wild eager haste with which he snatched himself away. At times in the course of this admirable personation, it was almost impossible to restrain the enthusiasm of the audience; there was a strong desire manifested to call him out in the Third and Fifth Acts, before
            the curtain fell. In the little after-piece on his benefitnight he played the light, dashing, off-hand Paragon
            with great spirit, and kept the audience pleased to the
            close.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the end of the performances he was summoned before
            the curtain and delivered the following speech, which
            was rapturously welcomed, and which we place on record
            for future reference. We have many reflections springing from this success of Mr. Murdoch’s, and the new
            light it casts upon our present Drama, to lay before our
            readers hereafter.

         <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
         
         <p>A fortnight since, I appeared a candidate for your approval;
            you were pleased to give me your favor; night after night you
            have gladdened my heart, by respectful attention and kind applause.
         </p>
         
         <p>Though words may fail to express my gratitude, my heart is 
            full to overflowing. To the kind friends who have greeted me
            here, and to the entire press of this city, I owe my life-long thanks
            lor the unanimous and generous support they have given me.
         </p>
         
         <p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to address a lew
            words to you, upon a subject ever near my own heart, and which 
            I am sure finds a corner in the hearts of ail who regard the intellectual development of this land of their birth or of their adoption.	
         </p>
         
         <p>England, France, and Spain possess a national Drama—which
            is their pride and boast—abounding in graphic pictures of national 
            character, where all of good, and beamy, and greatness belonging
            to a nation is faithfully chronicled.
         </p>
         
         <p>From certain givings forth of the popular mind, I may venture
            to say, that, in the mighty work which the present generation is
            destined to perform on this side of the Atlantic, the building up of
            a new Drama is a prominent object,—a drama bearing the spirit
            of our own common country, marked with the living features of
            humanity, and a bold outline of manners as they exist at present,
            and as they existed at that period when the founders of a young
            republic acted well their part.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Descended from a land which gave birth to a Shakspeare, what
            shall prevent our young writers from moulding into a dramatic
             form the rich materials which lie spread over the “pages of our
            common country’s history?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Let them begin the work whose end is to raise the genius
            and to mend the heart, and a generous public will cheer them on
            till they form a centre for the drama, around which higher aspirations shall cluster and shine.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Hoping that I may live to take part in such scenes, I now,
            ladies and gentlemen, bid yon (lor the present) farewell.
         </p>
         
         <p>“To one and all, I repeat my heart’s thanks and farewell!”</p>

            Theatres, will avail themselves of this opportunity, and
            listen to the strains of almost supernatural music he
            draws out of his splendid Grand Piano. We have not
            seen the programme yet, but we trust that Mr. De

         <p>OLD Bull will probably give another very latt Concert;—urged by many requests for a repetition of his last

         <p>Cheap Music.—Cheap literature is somewhat a stale
            subject with us now, but cheap music has all the advantage of novelty, and it has yet some farther advantages;
            for when the novelty is worn off, its excellence and cheapness will still remain. We have before us a book of songs
            —six songs—sixteen pages—admirably got up in every
            way, printing, paper, selection, and elegance of style, and
            sold for the small sum of twenty-five cents! We cannot
            understand how the publisher can afford to sell at such a
            price, and yet make a living; for this work, unlike the
            usual style of stereotype music, is really given to the public
            in beautiful form, and of durable materials. It is called the
            Musical World and is published on the Island loth of every
            month by Homans &amp; Ellis, 205 Broadway, the Editorial
            charge being confided to Mr. Henry C. Watson, whose
            musical reputation will be security for the excellence of
            the contents of the numbers. Besides the music, the
            cover contains the Journal of the Musical World, a periodical devoted to musical biography, criticism and intelligence, home and foreign, so that, to use the words of
            the Prospectus—the Musical World forms at once a
            choice and extensive Library of Music and a Journal of
            Musical Events.
         </p>
         
         <p>The work is certain, from its undoubted worth, to command the attention of the public, and the sale will be
            large, for the demand for music throughout the country is
            enormous. We recommend the Musical World to all our
            readers. Terms of subscriptions, etc. etc. can be learned
            through the advertisements.

            <p>Martin Farquhar Topper, Mr. Hooker, Wiley &amp;
               Putnam, and International Copyright.—The facts in
               this case are worth putting upon record as an indication
               of the movement in favor of International Copyright.—
               They have been brought before the public by Mr. Hooker’s publication of a ‘Card’ and the ‘Imprimatur’ of Mr.
               Tupper, the book in dispute being the ‘Proverbial Philosophy.’ Mr. Hooker published an edition of this work
               before the author was generally known, issued it at a high
               price, and it was going off slowly when the author published a popular novel, 'The Crock of Gold’, at first reissued in America in a shilling edition, and subsequently
               included in Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library of Choice
               Reading. Mr. Willis also began to write about Mr. Tupper, and meeting with him in England, gave a great impulse to his American reputation by telling the people in
               his letters that he was a brilliant young man, quite a vigorous plain spoken moralist (as his writings show) and
               that he was not at all dependent upon literature as a
               profession, being in the enjoyment of a city and country
               house, &amp;c. &amp;c: Then it came to pass how under different circumstances Pope had spoken a truth of human nature in his couplet—
               
               
               <div class="lg">
                  <br></br> Let but a Lord once own the happy Days, 
                  
                  <br></br>How the wit brightens and the sense refines.
               </div>
               
               Mr. Tupper was not, indeed, a lord, but the imputation
               of wealth scoured the wit and purified the sense just as
               well. The public admired wealth, and also showed that
               it knew how to appreciate it, in calling for a cheap
               edition of the Proverbial Philosophy. A Bostonian wit,
               by the way, in a spirit of poetic enthusiasm similar to
               that which once induced a “gentleman of Oxford” to
               translate Milton’s Paradise Lost into prose, got up an
               edition of the Proverbial Philosophy in prose too, whereby the printer was cheated out of his “fat” without the
               publisher, we presume, dining any better for the operation, either. Mr. Tupper brandished his 'Imprimatur’
               and held on to his price. Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam are
               urged to print the work in the Library of Choice Reading. Respecting the interests of Mr. Hooker they leave
               it alone, when one day, without any previous knowledge
               on their part of the fact, an edition appears in exact accordance with the style of the Library. Then they become the purchasers of the plates, and by an arrangement with Mr. Hooker publish the work in the Library by his consent and for his benefit. In the mean time,
               however, Mr. Hooker suspecting unjust interference, had
               issued his card, and the “Courier” points the gun at
               Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam. The explanation follows the
               charge, and here the matter rests, satisfactorily for all
               parties. The public get the book cheap, the piratical
               copy is bought up, and is now re-christened and doing
               good service for Mr. Hooker and the legitimate trade.
            </p>
            
            <p>The moral of all this is threefold. First, that there is
               no adequate protection for the right of the foreign author, though it maybe partially defended by the “courtesy of trade.” Second, that it is impossible at present to
               sustain a book purchased of a foreign author at a price
               which Will give him and his American publisher any
               adequate return; and third, that the only cure of the
               matter must be the passage of an International Copyright Law.
            </p>
            
            <p>Towards this end we have a right, energetic and manly assertion of what should be, by Mr. Tupper in his “Imprimatur’’, similar in directness to a letter once written
               on this subject by Mr. Carlyle; then an eloquent remonstrance from Mr. Hooker, a divine and publisher, himself an author, pledging him to the work, and not least
               a recognition by Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam of the sacredness of Mr. Hooker’s contract with the author, by their
               treaty for the publication of the book.

            <p>Tobacco and the Clergy.—The clergy, with most
               scholars, are great lovers of the weed. The smoke, they
               say, is the best lexicon to the intricacies of an old folio.
               One among the number, however, has turned traitor—
               the Rev. Benjamin I. Lane—and published his book on
               the other side. Per contra, we have according to Mr.
               Willis, the ladies assuming the cigar, the coquetry of
               the cigarito for the coquetry of the fan. and the following piece of poetry, written by a clergyman—argumentum ad hominem to the reverend author. The Morning

            <div class="biblPage">278</div>
            <p>The Country Papers on American Books.—Nearly
               every paper which comes to us has some cavil at American books, while the least particle of pretence is nourished and hugged and lionized, if it only come from some
               foreign Timothy Twiddlethought. It would be amusing
               were it not contemptible. The habit of mind which can
               see nothing good at home, whatever hypocritical ardor
               may be expressed, we may be confident has no true appreciation of what is good abroad. From the heart outward, from the home outward, from the country outward.
               Thus self discipline and self respect teach us to respect
               others; the good lather, the good son form the good
               citizen, and the love of country expands into the love of
               human kind. It is the weakest indication of old womanhood to strain the eyes at something from Paris, and turn
               up the nose at something, probably better, home-made.

            <div class="biblPage">278</div>
            <p>We copy the following just tribute to a man of genius
               from the “U. S. Journal.” We attribute it to the pen of
               Jesse E. Dow—himself a true poet and a judge of poetry.
            </p>
            
            <p>Poems, by William Wallace.—We are pleased to learn that
               this gentleman has in press a volume of Poems, which will shortly
               be issued. This will be a valuable addition to our literature.
               Mr. Wallace is a true poet—one who has contributed largely to the
               literary reputation of our country. Even his earliest efforts were
               crowned with unusual success. A small volume of his poems,
               published some six or eight years ago, was received with more
               than ordinary applause. Many of the pieces contained in it bore
               the stamp of a powerful and fervid imagination, an uncommon
               depth of feeling, a profound, metaphysical force of thought, combined with Originality and acuteness of perception. Within the
               last three years he has written poetry of sufficient merit to entitle
               him to rank with the first poets of the country. "Perditi,” a metrical romance, first published in Graham’s Magazine, contains passages, which lor forcible delineation of the passions, vigor of language, originality of conception, richness of imagery, and true
               pathos, will bear comparison with any poetry of the age. What
               could be more inspiring than his magnificent picture of the American battle-ship? The lovers immured in the dungeon of Lorra's
               halls is equal to any thing from the pen of Maturin. He has now
               a reputation—that reputation is gaining ground—and it will be his
               own fault it his name should not occupy a high niche in the temple
               of lame. Already he has been placed, by the ablest critic in the
               country, in a notice of his poem entitled the “Gods of Old,” on
               a footing with Schiller, and pronounced superior to Miss Barrett
               in the conception of his subject. This curious metaphysical production, so strikingly novel in design and execution, so replete
               with bold, piercing and original thoughts, will, we-trust, tie embraced in the collection. But of all Mr. Wallace’s efforts, nothing
               has struck us with so much force, as his last, entitled “The
               Statuary.” It is, without doubt one of the gems of the age. The
               very groundwork is poetry—genuine and original. The execution,
               the novelty and beauty of the figures—the boldness, truthfulness,
               manliness of the language—the dread magnificence of the pictures
               presented to the eye—all are beyond praise. This poem alone
               would stamp the author as a man of high and noble aspirations, as
               a true poet.
            </p>
            
            <p>By the way, the Express says, in referring to “The
               True Death,”
            </p>
            
            <p>The poem, the masterly poem of Wallace, The True Death, is
               marred by the Tennysonism of its prefix and suffix. It is a beautiful
               performanee, however, and worthy of this impassioned poet.
            </p>
            
            <p>This is all nonsense—as usual with the "Express.”
               No man is freer from Tennysonism, or any other “ism”
               than Wallace. We presume The Express alludes to
               “mere,” the common property of all mankind.

            <p>Doct. S’s experience and skill in his profession, give him confidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any
               Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
               varies in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
               difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
                of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
                same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
               artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
               natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
               natural appearance. In all these points', Doct S.’s manner is preeminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to
               surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
               generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
               makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and incases
               where the gnm has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
               the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
               causes a contraction of the lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of
               which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
               which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
               redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, render detection impossible.
            </p>

               thinkers of the age: and whether his conclusions are adopted or
               not, no reader can fail to perceive in any page, the traces of discri-mination, thought, and a high moral aim. Its classic purity and
               precision of style is also a strong commendation of the work.—Observer.

               seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
               being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
               and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
               East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this
               celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more intensely interesting narrative of his experience.

               the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming tar too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought
               to be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
               its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work

            <p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
               retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
               because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
               in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
               price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages T. F.
               Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
               in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
               and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and
               deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them
               above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas 
               retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine 
               article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No one, it is presumed,
               wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
               giving full details on this subject, which may be ban at their

               the finest grades of Green and Black Teas grown in the Celestial Empire, done
               up in all the various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is

            <p>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
               lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
               warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confident of the public. We know
               that their Teas, both in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many
               a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
               in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length lie has become hopeless
               of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market a kind
               which bad not such an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
               of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavors cultivated and
               packed with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into ibis
               country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have an Oolong,
               mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
               nervous persons. Its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
               to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
               never before drank such tea. But all tastes can here be suited, wish the great
               advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity- The Company’s Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—
