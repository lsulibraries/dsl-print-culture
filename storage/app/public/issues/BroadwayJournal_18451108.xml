NEW-YORK, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1845.
FROM THE FRENCH OF DE VIGNY.
Come on the sea, beloved,
Fearless and free,
Leave friends and wealth behind;
Come, come with me.
My bark on the water shines
A fairy thing;—
See her pennon, mast and keel!
She is but a little shell,
Yet there I am king.
The earth was made for the slave,
Oh maiden free,
But for man, the stern and brave,
The boundless sea.
The waves breathe in their (low
A mystery,
And tenderly they sing
fn their soft murmuring—
Love,, Liberty.	ANNE C. LYNCH.
The Fate of Alcestis.
Facilis descensus Averni; 
Sed revocare gradum––
He labor–hocopusest. 
</p>
         <p>It was twilight in the infernal regions. All was still-
<br/>ness in the Stygian palace, for Proserpina had not yet
<br/>made her appearance from the chamber where she usu-
<br/>ally retired after dinner, to indulge herself in a siesta.
<br/>Pluto had gone on a visit to Olympus to complain of sonic
<br/>new Esculapius, and the scarcity of fresh arrivals in his
<br/>dominions; for it was a subject of lamentation through-
<br/>out Hell, that a full month had elapsed without any tri-
<br/>bute money being paid to Charon, for carrying souls
<br/>across the Hateful Passage. The old man was rheumat-
<br/>ic from his long inactivity, and so cross, that nobody,save,
<br/>his master, ventured to speak to him. The ill humor
<br/>was so general that it extended to the royal abode; and
<br/>even the sternly serene countenance of the monarch had
<br/>Worn on his departure so black an expression that his at-
<br/>tendants shrunk from his looks. He had gone without
<br/>taking leave of his queen; indeed, it was said they were
<br/>bot upon the most cordial terms; though the exact truth
<br/>could not be ascertained, none venturing to interfere in
<br/>his Majesty’s domestic affairs. The infernal courtiers
<br/>were scattered here and there about the palace; some
<br/>playing at domestic, smoking their pipes under the sha-
<br/>dow of the huge cypresses that hung their mournful
<br/>wreaths from the columns of the porticoes; others read-
<br/>ing the newspapers by the expiring light, or stretched
<br/>in listless ease along the black marble benches. Three
<br/>dark figures were pacing the long gravel walks, wrapped
<br/>in their cloaks, with their eyes fixed on the ground.—
<br/>These were the Eumcnides, and they seemed too deeply
<br/>absorbed for conversation. The only interruption to the</p>
         <p/>
         <p>silence was the heavy and continuous roaring of Cocy
<br/>tus, as his black waves rolled gloomily on, to unite them-
<br/>selves with the vast channel of Acheron; and the crack-
<br/>ling heard from Phlegethon, as occasionally shoots of
<br/>flame illuminated the increasing darkness. Now and
<br/>then, too, Cerberus, who lay slumbering on the river-side,
<br/>would lift up one of his three heads, and utter a low, la-
<br/>zy growl at the sound of some fancied footstep. Then
<br/>he would shake his three pair of ears, and compose him-
<br/>self again to sleep.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“I can play no more,” said one of the gamesters, ri-
<br/>sing from his seat. “It is too dark to distinguish the
<br/>points.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Nay, friend,” returned the winner, “one stake more.
<br/>I will risk ten to one we have new arrivals to-night.—
<br/>There is a plague raging in Thessaly.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“And what of that? What rs the World coming to?
<br/>A plague—and does not Jove send an antidote to every
<br/>poison? The shears of Atropos will rust for want of
<br/>usage. Look—the poor thing is ready to expire with
<br/>ennui!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The figure he pointed out was sitting in a melancholy
<br/>posture, under one of the pillars of the infernal throne.
<br/>One hand supported her head; its marble whiteness
<br/>strangely contrasted with her raven tresses and black
<br/>robes—and the other, hanging negligently at her side,
<br/>held the fatal scissors.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There was a sudden stir among the attendants, and
<br/>Proserpina herself appeared. Her stately figure was en-
<br/>veloped in the imperial robes worn on state occasions,
<br/>and a gorgeous crown was upon her head. She moved
<br/>with divine majesty, attended, but not supported, by her
<br/>favorite hand-maidens, and bending a haughty glance up-
<br/>on the awed group before her, paused ere she ascended
<br/>the seat of sovereignty. Her voice, when she spoke, was
<br/>like the murmur of falling waters.</p>
         <p>“How now—Tyche! why are not the lamps lighted?
For what have you the charge of our palace?”
“So please your Majesty, Tisiphone’s last draught of
oil for the uses of Tartarus, exhausted our present store.”
“Do your duty, sir, and trouble me no more with thy
presence. Arc we to receive company in darkness ?”
“I did not know your Majesty expected company,”
ventured her favorite maiden.
</p>
         <p>“Certainly: thou knowest to-night is the anniversary
<br/>of my coronation. I have ordered supper in the great
<br/>halland–”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Alas, dear mistress,” said the maiden, putting her
<br/>handkerchief to her eyes—“is it not rather an occasion
<br/>for mourning?—Can you have forgotten the lovely vale
<br/>of Enna, and our blithe garlands, and pastoral songs—
<br/>and the birth-day gifts of Ceres? When shall we be so
<br/>happy again? Oh that fatal pomegranate!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Have done with your whining nonsense, Cyane,” cried
<br/>the Queen, angrily; “or by my father Jupiter, and my
<br/>mother Ceres, and my grandmother Vesta, I will send</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page268"/>
         </p>
         <p>you to keep company with the trees and fountains—that
<br/>may reply to your wailings—if you so much as name
<br/>Sicily to me again!” But when the favorite pressed
<br/>more closely to tile side of her mistress, and looked up
<br/>tenderly and tearfully in her face, and dropped her eyes
<br/>on the ground, as if afraid of her displeasure, the Queen
<br/>put her arm around her affectionately, and spoke more
<br/>mildly.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Nay, good Cyane, take it not so to heart. Come—I
<br/>will tell you a secret”; and she bent her lips to the mai-
<br/>den’s ear. “A youth will join us to-night, whose beauty
<br/>would make jealous our brother Apollo.”</p>
         <p>Cyane once more dropped her eyes on the ground.
</p>
         <p>“He is to be my cup-bearer. Shall I not equal the
<br/>Olympian Juno? It is Admetus, King of Thessaly, whom
<br/>the Fates this night conduct to my realm. We will be
<br/>magnificent, though my lord be in heaven. But the hour
<br/>is come.” And she took out her gold repeater, which
<br/>rang nine clear strokes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Atropos, my girl, you are dull to-night.” Atropos
<br/>lifted up her head with a melancholy smile. The shears
<br/>were half open.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Then a tumult was heard at the gates. They were
<br/>shaken with long and loud clamor, and the sound of ma-
<br/>ny voices. The palace slaves ran hither and thither, to
<br/>find out the meaning of the confusion, and Cerberus sent
<br/>up a triple yell, that might have frightened Rhadaman-
<br/>thus himself. The portals burst open with a thunderous
<br/>crash, and Pluto’s outriders entered helter skelter.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“What is all this?” cried Proserpina, forcing compo-
<br/>sure, as she sate upon her throne, beating rapidly her
<br/>cushioned footstool with her little feet, in impatience at
<br/>the unwonted disorder. “Is Tartarus let loose?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Nay, your highness!” said a knight, throwing him-
<br/>self from his horse, and kneeling on one knee at her au-
<br/>gust feet—“only Pluto is coming back.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Pluto coming back!” exclaimed the queen; and she
<br/>gave Cyane a pinch that made the poor girl’s arm black
<br/>and blue. “ What, in Jove’s name, is the matter?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“No matter at all, your Majesty. But Nycteus, one
<br/>of the four black royal steeds, has cast a shoe, and our
<br/>master has ordered him to Lemnos, that Vulcan may re-
<br/>pair the damage. But here comes the king.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Pluto stared as he saw the saloon illuminated with
<br/>wax tapers, and his spouse arrayed in gorgeous apparel.
<br/>He even stopped, as he came near, and his brow gather-
<br/>ed blackness.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Ah, truant!” exclaimed Proserpina, throwing her
<br/>scarf gracefully back, and extending her white hand—
<br/>“can nought but mischance bring thee to my side? And
<br/>on the anniversary of our wedding, too! We must grace
<br/>the occasion with a little splendor, though sooth, my
<br/>heart is always heavy enough, having so oft to count, in
<br/>loneliness and sadness, the hours of thy absence!” And
<br/>she averted her face, and covered her dark eyes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Pluto’s nature was stubborn, but he never could abide
<br/>the sight of a woman’s tears. All he shed were iron;
<br/>and there was something in the softness of liquid sorrow
<br/>that melted his very soul. So he applied himself to
<br/>sooth his aggrieved wife; wiped her eyes with her cam-
<br/>bric handkerchief, and promised, on the honor of a king,
<br/>never to swerve from his affection to her.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Cheer up, my flower! we must have no tears on our
<br/>wedding day. Cheer up!—Look—there is some one, as
<br/>I live! in Charon’s barge!”</p>
         <p>There was a general rush of expectation, and all eyes
were directed to the boat, as it came slowly across the
</p>
         <p>dark waters. Proserpina's heart beat almost audibly.—
<br/>The barge touched the hither strand and two figures ap-
<br/>peared, marshalled by the sullen oarsman. They land-
<br/>ed, and one advanced. It was a youth, of perfect figure,
<br/>and face that shamed the morning. Pluto saw that he
<br/>stopped not to pay his fare,and his suspicions were again
<br/>excited.</p>
         <p/>
         <p> "This is your solitude,” said he to his lady wife.—
<br/>“Yon fair stripling, it seems, had your previous war-
<br/>rant to pass. Pray, what is his business here?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Proserpina trembled, but she was too proud to show
<br/>fear. “I have destined him to an office in my house-
<br/>hold”—she answered, boldly.</p>
         <p>“And what, if I may ask?”
“My cup-bearer.”
</p>
         <p>“Your cup-bearer! You must ape the deities of heav-
<br/>en in all their absurd follies? Out upon you!” cried the
<br/>monarch, as he stamped his foot; the blow shook the
<br/>foundations of hell and of the earth; the tides of ocean
<br/>receded, and the inhabitants of Sicily recorded another
<br/>earthquake.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Oh, Pluto! a truce to your stuff!” gaily answered
<br/>the queen, in a voice of music that penetrated the re-
<br/>cesses of Erebus. “Have done with your folly, and re-
<br/>ceive your visitor. See you not, it is Mercury?"</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The black haired king had already perceived his mis-
<br/>take, and felt ashamed of his violence, as the beautiful
<br/>stranger approached. The wings attached to his helmet
<br/>and sandals, and the wings upon his wand of gold en-
<br/>twined with emerald serpents, denoted the messenger of
<br/>Jove. The sword by which Argus fell was girt to his
<br/>side, and a lyre hung neglected over his shoulders, half
<br/>covered by his profusion of bright golden curls. His eye
<br/>was clear and piercing, and his step light and swift as
<br/>he drew nigh the throne. He bowed gracefully to Pluto,
<br/>kissed the fair hand of Proserpina, and hoped he found
<br/>his kinswoman in good health.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Apollo sends your highness this, with his compli-
<br/>ments,” said the youthful deity, presenting the queen a
<br/>rose-colored note, perfumed and sealed with red wax.—
<br/>Then he turned to Pluto—and they were soon deep in the
<br/>discussion of the politics of heaven, and the gossip of
<br/>the court of Jove. Proserpina turned aside to read the
<br/>note.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Lo, Cyane!” cried she, reddening with vexation,—
<br/>“Apollo has the insolence to propose me a substitute for
<br/>Admetus! Heard you ever the like! The Farcer, he says,
<br/>have promised to excuse the Prince’s death, provided
<br/>some voluntary victim can be found to fill his place!—
<br/>They think to pass his wife upon me! But I will send
<br/>her back to him—that I will! They might have asked
<br/>my leave!”</p>
         <p>“What is the matter?” cried Pluto, seeing the distur-
bance of his spouse.
</p>
         <p>“Summon hither yon shivering ghost,” said Proserpi-
<br/>na angrily—for once taking no heed of her lord. "I
<br/>would see who has had the courage to brave my presence
<br/>uncalled!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mercury stepped back, and beckoned his companion to
<br/>the foot of the throne. Slowly and timidly the shade
<br/>approached, gliding through a throng of attendants ea-
<br/>ger for a glance at the new comer. It stopped at some
<br/>distance from the Stygian sovereigns.</p>
         <p>“Come nearer,” said the empress of the dead in a
softer tone, “and doff thy mantle.”
The spirit obeyed; and the shroud falling, revealed a
countenance and form of transcendant loveliness. The
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page2"/>r&gt;!&gt;
</p>
         <p>face was passing pale, and the calm passionless eyes
<br/>were unshadowed by thought or emotion; nor moved the
<br/>long fair locks that hung from the clear temples, with
<br/>the breath from the colorless lips. It stood motionless,
<br/>yet quivering, like the shadow of some beautiful statue,
<br/>seen in the trembling pool.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Now by the helmet of the Cyclops,” exclaimed Plu-
<br/>to, gazing upon the vision—“it is a lovely one! Whom
<br/>have you brought us, Mercury?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“It is the bride of Thessaly. She dies in her husband’s 
<br/>stead, who lives for having sheltered Phosbus,” answered
<br/>Mercury, hesitating a little, for he was too much given
<br/>to lying not to find difficulty in speaking the truth.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Thessaly was a fool to part with her,” said the god.
<br/>“But she shall fare bravely. Here, some of you, give
<br/>her in charge to Eacus. She shall become one of us.—
<br/>So, my love, you never told me it was a lady cup-bearer
<br/>you expected. That was quite a different affair. How
<br/>could you sport with my fondness? Fie—Proserpina!”
<br/>“And fie, Pluto! to frown upon one who shares thy
<br/>throne. Verily, thou art quicker to suspicion than to
<br/>aught else; whereas, in aught that concerns thy consort,
<br/>as Hamlet says,</p>
         <p>Duller shouldst thou be, than the fat weed
That roots itself at ease on Lethe wharf.
</p>
         <p> "I say Amen to that!” said Mercury, who always took j
<br/>part with the ladies. Down, vile cur! I wish, good
<br/>kinsman, you would teach this dog of yours better man-
<br/>ners! Here he has daubed my court dress with the mud
<br/>of the Acherusian fen! Down with you, fellow!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cerberus burst into a yell of agony, and retreated to-
<br/>wards his master, with his three heads stooped to the
<br/>ground, and his immense bushy tail sweeping the floor
<br/>behind him. The cause of his alarm was soon apparent.
<br/>A brawny figure was seen halfway across the river of
<br/>hell, grasping Charon’s two ears, and urging the bark
<br/>onward with incredible speed. The sullen old man was
<br/>swearing lustily at being compelled to play the part of
<br/>an idle passenger in his own boat, which shot over the
<br/>waters with such swiftness as to curl the sluggish wave,
<br/>and leave a wake of foam. It touched the side; the fi-
<br/>gure leaped on shore, bestowed a hearty box upon the
<br/>ferryman, and pursued by his execrations, entered the
<br/>imperial palace, and strode into the presence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“You are welcome, Hercules,” said the queen, who
<br/>was first to recover from her surprise. “You are welcome
<br/>to our court. How goes on the earth?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Not quite well, your highness,” answered the son of
<br/>Alcmena, saluting Pluto and the winged deity—“else I
<br/>had not come hither to complain. How do you do, my
<br/>pretty Cyane?”</p>
         <p>“It is long”—said Pluto, civily—“since we last greet-
ed you in the shades.”
</p>
         <p>“And then my errand was no peaceful one. Be quiet,
<br/>monster!" The hound had crouched for protection un-
<br/>der the chairs, and was growling with fear and rage.—
<br/>Thou need’st not again dread the upper air. Earth had</p>
         <p>enough of thee on thy last visit.––But to the point: I
come to ask a dear boon of your highness.”
“What boon shall the mighty Alcides ask, that I will
not grant?’’ cried the Stygian Juno.
“Trust my well known generosity,” said Pluto.
</p>
         <p>“I thank your graces both,” answered Hercules, tak-
<br/>ing snuff; “and will unfold my business. The youthful
<br/>consort of Admetus has just passed into your dominions.
<br/>Her lord, frantic at her loss, is almost expiring with
<br/>grief. Moved by the sight of his woe, I hare sworn,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>by immortal Jove, to implore at your hands the lost Al-
<br/>cestis. Let me conduct her back to earth. Seal your
<br/>empire over the world by one great act of clemency, and
<br/>make happy two faithful lovers by restoring them to
<br/>each other.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Pluto and Proserpina looked at each other while the
<br/>son of Alcmena spoke. Images of felicity and blighted
<br/>affection, and restored happiness, flitted before their fan-
<br/>cy. The queen thought of the bright fields of Enna, and
<br/>her youthful companions, and her shepherd lovers; and
<br/>the monarch thought of his bride in her earth-born beau-
<br/>ty, and her charming bashfulness, and his swift chariot,
<br/>and the Cecropian cave. As for Mercury, he was too
<br/>well bred to interpose in a delicate matter. So he turn-
<br/>ed on his heel, and whistled “Zip Coon.”</p>
         <p>“Do it”—whispered Hercules in the ear of his majes-
ty—“and I will send you Diomedes and his horses.”
“I have no objection,” said Proserpina, putting up her
lip.
</p>
         <p>“This must be thought of,” at length replied the king
<br/>of Hades. “It is no easy matter to reverse the decree of
<br/>fate.”</p>
         <p>“I have the lady on my side”—muttered Hercules, glan-
cing at the queen.
</p>
         <p>“Well, that is half the battle,” said Pluto. “In the
<br/>mean time, you must sup with us, my good lad. This,
<br/>you know, is our wedding day; and Proserpina has de-
<br/>vised a little party, and a dance, and so forth—having
<br/>bespoken Orpheus himself for her fiddler. So come along;
<br/>give Madame your arm. Mercury, we should be happy
<br/>of your company; but I see you are in haste, therefore
<br/>will not detain you from your ambrosia and nectar on
<br/>Olympus. Make my compliments to Jupiter and the la-
<br/>dies. Come on, Alcides.”</p>
         <p>******
</p>
         <p>Thrice had the hours on the Thessalian plain meas-
<br/>ured the westering sun; the growing shade upon the di-
<br/>al’s changing plate in vain had warned the shepherd;
<br/>matron, youth and maid and gray-haired sire poured from
<br/>the city’s breast, where every toil for a brief space had
<br/>rest. They came to pay the last funereal rite to their
<br/>lost queen. Upon the bier she lay, lovely in death; her</p>
         <p>shrouded face more white than e’er the royal rose.––
</p>
         <p>Along the way that led to Pluto’s temple, on the ground
<br/>were scattered cypress boughs; and far around the hands
<br/>of pious friends scattered buds. Within the hallowed
<br/>fane the victims stood—three sable bulls; their brows
<br/>with cypress crowned, and adianthus, and the daffodil,
<br/>mingling their modest hues and sad perfume, sacred to
<br/>him who rules beyond the tomb.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Thrice had the priest invoked the sacred Nine, and
<br/>thrice relumed the flame of sacrifice that burnt before
<br/>the shrine. Then lifting high the knife, “This hand of
<br/>mine,” he cried, “dread Pluto, that devotes to thee this
<br/>offering (oh, accepted may it be!) was never stain-
<br/>ed with crime! So thou receive the sacrifice. Immor-
<br/>tal Proserpina! In thy rich favor to the lost one give a
<br/>glorious doom in the Elysian plains! And grant where
<br/>now keen anguish only reigns in our Admetus’ breast,
<br/>the peace divine of pious recognition may abide, serene
<br/>as hers who for her consort died!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He entered, and the weeping train came nigh; with
<br/>sighs suppressed in vain, the hoary Pheres and Clymene
<br/>with her sad veiled brow, were seen. Bereaved Adme-
<br/>tus, lifting inwards the skies his clasped beseeching
<br/>hands; with sympathizing woe the pious youths their
<br/>king surround, with flowing locks, and eyes that seek the
<br/>ground.</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page270"/>
         </p>
         <p>“Lo!” cried tire priest; “is there not one of all who
<br/>silent stand by this untimely pall, to tell her praises who
<br/>thus coldly lies the bride of death?” He said; with kin-
<br/>dly eyes a youth stepped forth; grasping" the rural lyre,
<br/>to sing with trembling lips and heart on fire.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Gracious Apollo I invoke; and thee, first of the
<br/>Nine, renowned Calliope! who sit’st in splendor on the
<br/>mountain height where soar the swans, with crest of
<br/>glancing light, that yet beside the Heliconian spring
<br/>curve the proud neck and fold the sounding wing. As-
<br/>sist my lyre, for now I boldly sing of worth might ask
<br/>its music, were my tongue hallowed as his with whom
<br/>Olympus rung.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Noble she was—and fair; with beauty crowned such
<br/>as the Cyprian queen, of charms renowned, would know
<br/>surpassed her own. Why, Parcæ, why doomed ye such
<br/>matchless loveliness to die? Hid Pluto claim from earth
<br/>another bride? or would the queen of shades in envy
<br/>hide such beauty from the world? For never yet hath
<br/>he whose oar doth rule the Stygian tide, on his black
<br/>shores so pure a spirit met!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Why did the scythe of death strike down the flower
<br/>scarce opened to the sun? Age hath its hour to fade and
<br/>fall; the bleak north wind doth spare the gentle stalk to
<br/>sweep in ruin bare the mountain-cresting oak. The ten-
<br/>der vine sees not its blossoms ere their fruit decline; nor
<br/>doth their mother earth untimely mourn the blighted buds
<br/>her genial breast had borne to gladsome summer. Couldst
<br/>thou not, O, Death! hare won some elder prey whose fail-
<br/>ing breath might have redeemed thy victim?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Lo! how wail her babes their mother lost! the youth-
<br/>ful train of matrons ask her, and the sylvan vale whose
<br/>haunt she loved, and the luxuriant plain. Ye, who adored
<br/>her, breathe the last fond sigh o’er her fair corse! Clouds,
<br/>weep your tributes here! Sun, veil thy splendors. Pitying
<br/>winds, reply! sweep a sad requiem o’er Alcestis’ bier!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Hide the pale cold face forever from the gaze of her
<br/>lord, and remove the corse into the temple. Let her be
<br/>entombed in holy ground. Follow her, comrades, and
<br/>chant with me the solemn death song. Let the virtues
<br/>of the lost one be the theme of the last lay her parting
<br/>spirit hears."</p>
         <p>Chorus.*
Daughter of Pelias! joyful be thy home—
Glorious thy lot in Pluto’s realm of gloom
Thou dweller in a cold and sunless dome!
The dark-haired god who bids the firing mourn,
And he—the oarsman of that dreary tide,
Of all Earth’s daughters know thee lor the pride
His bark o’er Acherontiau waves hath borne
Poets shall praise thee on the mountain lyre
Seven-stringed—and choral hymns, in tones of fire,
From countless minstrels shall thy name inspire!
In Sparta, when the Carnean month returns,
What lime in Heaven the full-orbed moon doth reign,
In Athens—shall be heard the lofty strain
Thou parting wak’st in souls where genius burns.
Oh! would the power were mine to bring thee forth
From Stygian caves to bless the abodes of earth—
From black Cocytus of infernal birth—
With mighty oar across Hell's tide to sweep!
For thou, most loved of women! thou alone
For thy lord’s failing life hast given thine own—
Redeeming thus his spirit from the deep.
Light press the earth upon thy virtuous breast!
* From a prose version of the Chorus in the tragedy of "Alcestis," fur-
nished the writer. 
Ne’er be thy spouse in other arms caressed!
Else thy babes scorn, and Heaven deny him rest!
Thou, when his sire, with age and sorrow white,
His hoary mother, trembling nigh the grave,
Refused with yielded life their son to save—
Their son, of youthful years the sole delight—
In youth’s fresh prime, in beauty’s sunny bloom
Thou, sell-devoted for another’s doom,
Hast passed the darksome portals of the tomb!
So true a spouse, ye gods! cn me bestow!
Thus in rare bliss, like some bright river’s tide,
Serene the measure of my days should glide,
Unchecked by strife, unclouded e’er by wo!

         <p>Hath a new morning dawned? Who is’t comes nigh,
<br/>rivalling Aurora, daughter of the sky? A form of
<br/> strength forth from the temple gate leads a veiled fair
<br/>one to Admetus’ side;—“Receive the bounty of relent-
<br/>ing Fate—Proserpina’s gift—a new and lovely bride.”—
<br/>One look of scorn	another—she is known!—“Alcestis!</p>
         <p>It is she! my loved—mine own!”

ON A LADY WITH RED HATS.

The Devil in the Belfry.
What o’clock is it?—Old Saying.
</p>
         <p>Every body knows, in a general way, that the finest
<br/>place in the world is—or, alas, urns—the Dutch borough
<br/>of Vondervotteimittiss. Yet, as it lies some distance
<br/>from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat out of
<br/>the way situation, there are, perhaps, very few of my
<br/>readers who have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of
<br/>those who have not, therefore, it will be only proper that
<br/>I should enter into some account of it. And this is, in-
<br/>deed, the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting
<br/>public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design
<br/>here to give a history of the calamitous events which
<br/>have so lately occurred within its limits. No one who
<br/>knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed will
<br/>be executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid
<br/>impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and
<br/>diligent collation of authorities which should ever dis-
<br/>tinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscrip-
<br/>tions, I am enabled to say, positively, that the borough
<br/>of Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in pre-
<br/>cisely the same condition which it at present preserves.
<br/>Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can on-
<br/>ly speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which
<br/>mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up with in
<br/>certain algebraic formulae. The date, I may thus say, in
<br/>regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less
<br/>than any assignable quantity whatsoever.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimit-
<br/>tis, I confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault.—
<br/>Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point,
<br/>some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the reverse,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered
<br/>satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg, nearly co- 
<br/>incident with that of Kroutaplenttey, is to be cautiously 
<br/>preferred. It runs:—“Vondcrvottcimittis—Vonder, lege
<br/>Dander—Vottcimittis, quasi und Blcitziz—Bleitztz obsol:
<br/>pro Blitzcn.” This derivation, to say the truth, is still
<br/>countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident
<br/>on the summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-
<br/>Council. I do not choose, however, to commit myself
<br/>on a theme of such importance, and must refer the reader
<br/>desirous of information, to the “Oratiunculae de Rebus
<br/>Praeter-Vetens," of Dundergutz. See, also, Blunderbuz-
<br/>zard “De Derivationibus," pp. 27 to 5010, Folio Gothic
<br/>edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cy-
<br/>pher;—wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the auto-
<br/>graph of Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of
<br/>Gruntundguzzell.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the
<br/>date of the foundation of Voudervotteimittis, and the de-
<br/>rivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as I said be-
<br/>fore, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch.
<br/>The oldest man in the borough can remember not the
<br/>slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of
<br/>it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility
<br/>is considered an insult. The site of the village is in a
<br/>perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in cir-
<br/>cumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over
<br/>whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass.
<br/>For this they assign the very good- reason that they do
<br/>not believe there is anything at all on the other side.</p>
         <p>Round the skirts of the valley, (which is quite level,
and paved throughout with Hat tiles.) extends a continu-
</p>
         <p>ous row of sixty little houses. These, having their backs
<br/>on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of the
<br/>plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each
<br/>dwelling. Every house has a small garden before it,
<br/>with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four cabba-
<br/>ges. The buildings themselves are so precisely alike,
<br/>that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.
<br/>Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is
<br/>somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strik-
<br/>ingly picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned
<br/>little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the walls look
<br/>like a chess-board upon a great scale. The gables are
<br/>turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all
<br/>the rest of the house, over the eaves and over the main
<br/>doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with very
<br/>tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a
<br/>vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The wood-
<br/>work, throughout, is of a dark hue, and there is much
<br/> carving about it, with but a trilling variety of pattern;
<br/> for, time out of mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittis
<br/>have never been able to carve more than two objects—
<br/>a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceed-
<br/> ingly well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity,
<br/>wherever they find room for the chisel.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the
<br/> furniture is all upon one plan. The floors are of square
<br/> tiles, the chairs and tables of black-looking wood with
<br/>thin crooked legs and puppy feet. The mantle-pieces
<br/>are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and
<br/>cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real time-piece,
<br/>which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the mid-
<br/> dle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on
<br/> each extremity by way of outrider. Between each cab-
<br/>bage and the time-piece again, is a little china man hav-
<br/>ing a large stomach with a great round hole in it, through
<br/>which is seen the dial-plate of a watch.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The fire-places are large and deep, with fierce crooked-
<br/>looking fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and
<br/>a huge pot over it full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which
<br/>the good woman of the house is always busy in attending,
<br/> She is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face,</p>
         <p/>
         <p> and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with
<br/> purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress is of orange-col-
<br/>ored linsey-woolsey made very full behind and very short
<br/> in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects, not
<br/>reaching below the middle of her leg. This is some-
<br/>what thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair
<br/>of green stockings to cover them. Her shoes, of pink
<br/>leather, are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons
<br/>puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In her left hand
<br/>she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she
<br/>wields a ladle for the sauer-kraut and pork. By her side
<br/>there stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy repeater tied
<br/>to its tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way
<br/>of a quiz.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The boys themselves arc, all three of them, in the gar-
<br/>den attending the pig. They are each two feet in height.
<br/>They have three-cornered cocked hats, purple waiscoats
<br/>reaching down to their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red
<br/>woollen stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles,
<br/>and long surtout coats with large buttons of mother-of-
<br/>pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little
<br/>dumpy watch in. his right hand. He takes a puff and a
<br/>look, and then a look and a-puff. The pig, which is cor-
<br/>pulent and lazy, is occupied now in picking up the stray
<br/>leaves that fall from the cabbages, and now in giving a
<br/>kiek behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins have</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page272"/>
also tied to his tail, in order to make him look as hand-
some as the cat.
</p>
         <p>Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bot-
<br/>tomed armed chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like
<br/>the tables, is seated the old man of the house himself.—
<br/>He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with big
<br/>circular eyes and a huge double chin. His dress resem-
<br/>bles that of the boys, and I need say nothing farther
<br/>about it. All the difference is that his pipe is somewhat
<br/>bigger than theirs, and he can make a greater smoke.—
<br/>Like them, he has a watch, but be carries his watch in
<br/>his pocket. To say the truth, he has something of more
<br/>importance than a watch to attend to, and what that is I
<br/>shall presently explain. He sits with his right leg upon
<br/>his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always
<br/>keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a cer-
<br/>tain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This object is situated in the steeple of the House of
<br/>the Town-Council. The Town-Council are all very lit-
<br/>tle, round, oily, intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and
<br/>fat double chins, and hare their coats much longer and
<br/>their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabi-
<br/>tants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my sojourn in the
<br/>borough they have had several special meetings, and have
<br/>adopted these three important resolutions:</p>
         <p>“That it is wrong to alter the good old course of
things”—
“That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteim-
ittiss”—and
“That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”
</p>
         <p>Above the session room of the Council is the steeple,
<br/>and in the steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has ex-
<br/>isted time out of mind, the pride and wonder of the vil-
<br/>lage—the great clock of the borough of Vondervotteiinit-
<br/>tiss. And this is the object to which the eyes of the old
<br/>gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather-bottomed
<br/>arm chairs.	</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the 
<br/>seven sides of the steeples—so that it can be readily seen 
<br/>from all quarters. Its faces are large and white, and its
<br/>bands heavy and black. There is a belfry-man whose 
<br/>sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most per- 
<br/>feet of sinecures, for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was
<br/>never yet known to have anything the matter with it.—
<br/>Until lately the bare supposition of such a thing was con-
<br/>sidered heretical. From the remotest period of antiquity
<br/>to which the archives have reference, the hours have
<br/>been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed, the
<br/>case was just the same with all the other clocks and
<br/>watches in the borough. Never was such a place for
<br/>keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought
<br/>proper to say “twelve o’clock!” all its obedient follow-
<br/>ers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded
<br/>like a very echo. In short the good burghers were fond
<br/>of their sauer-kraut, bat then they were proud of their
<br/>clocks.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more
<br/>or less respect, and as the belfry-man of Vondervotteimit-
<br/>tis has the most perfect of sinecures, he is the most per-
<br/>fectly respected of any man in the world. He is the chief
<br/>dignitary of the borough, and the very pigs look up to
<br/>him with a sentiment of reverence. His coat-tail is very
<br/>far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his eyes, and his
<br/>stomach, very far bigger than those of any other old gentle-
<br/>man in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only
<br/>double but triple.</p>
         <p>I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteim-
ittiss; alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience
a reverse!
</p>
         <p>There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabi-
<br/>tants that “no good can come from over the hills,” and it
<br/>really seemed that the words had in them something of
<br/>the spirit of prophecy. It wanted five minutes of noon,
<br/>on the day day before yesterday, when there appeared a
<br/>very odd-looking object on the summit of the ridge to the
<br/>eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted uni-
<br/>versal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat
<br/>in a leather-bottomed arm-chair, turned one of his eyes
<br/>with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon, still keep-
<br/>ing the other upon the clock in the steeple.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon,
<br/>the droll object in question was perceived to be a very
<br/>diminutive foreign-looking young man. He descended
<br/>the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a
<br/>good look at him. He was really the most finnicky little
<br/>personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimitiss.
<br/>His countenance was of a dark snuff colour, and he had
<br/>a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an ex-
<br/>cellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of
<br/>displaying, as he was grinning from ear to car. What
<br/>with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest
<br/>of his face to be seen. His head was uncovered,and his hair
<br/>neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting
<br/>swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets
<br/>dangled a vast length of white handkerchief,) black ker-
<br/>seymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-look-
<br/>ing pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon lor
<br/>bows. Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras,
<br/>and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big
<br/>as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from
<br/>which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner
<br/>of fantastical steps, he took snuff incessantly with an
<br/>air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless
<br/>me! here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vonder-
<br/>votteimittiss!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grin-
<br/>ning, an audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he
<br/>curvetted right into the village, the odd stumpy appear-
<br/>ance of his pumps excited no little suspicion, and many
<br/>a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a
<br/>trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief
<br/>which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swal-
<br/>low-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous
<br/>indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he
<br/>cut a fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem
<br/>to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing
<br/>as keeping time in his steps.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance,
<br/>however, to get their eyes thoroughly open, when,
<br/>just as it wanted half a minute of noon, the rascal hounc-
<br/> ed, as I say, right into the midst of them; gave a chassez
<br/>here and a balancez there; and then, after a pirouette
<br/>and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up into
<br/>the belfry of the house of the Town-Council, where the
<br/>wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dig-
<br/>nity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at once
<br/>by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big
<br/>chapeau-de-bras upon his head; knocked it down over his
<br/>eyes and month; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat
<br/>him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the
<br/>belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow,
<br/>you would have sworn that there was a regiment of dou-
<br/>ble-bass drummers all beating the devil’s tattoo up in the
<br/>belfry of the steeple of Voudervoueimittiss.</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page873"/>
         </p>
         <p>There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance
<br/>this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabi-
<br/>tants, but for the important fact that it now wanted only-
<br/>half a second of noon. The bell was about to strike, and
<br/>it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity
<br/>that every body should look well at his watch. It was
<br/>evident, however, that just at this moment, the fellow in
<br/>the steeple was doing something that he had no business
<br/>to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, no
<br/>body had any time to attend to his manoeuvres, for they
<br/>had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded.</p>
         <p>“One!” said the clock.
</p>
         <p>"Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every
<br/>leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss.—
<br/>“Von!” said his watch also; “von!” said the watch of
<br/>his vrow, and “von!” said the watches of the boys, and
<br/>the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig.</p>
         <p>"Two!” continued the big bell; and
“Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.
“Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine!
Ten !” said the bell.
“Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin!
Den!” answered the others.
“Eleven!” said the big one.
“Eleben!” assented the little fellows.
“Twelve!” said the bell.
“Dvelf!" they replied, perfectly satisfied, and dropping
their voices,
</p>
         <p>“Und dvelf it iss!” said all the little old gentlemen,
<br/>putting up their watches. But the big bell had not done
<br/>with them yet.</p>
         <p>“Thirteen!" said he.
</p>
         <p> "Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning
<br/>pale, dropping their pipes, and putting down all their
<br/>right legs from over their left knees.</p>
         <p>“Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—
Mein Gott, it is—it is Dirteen o’clcck!!”
</p>
         <p>Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which en-
<br/>sued? All Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamen-
<br/>table state of uproar.</p>
         <p>“Vot is cura’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys,—
"I’ve been ongry for dis hour!”
“Vot is cum’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows,
“It has been done to rags for dis hour!”
</p>
         <p>“Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old
<br/>gentlemen, “Donder and Blitzen! it has been smoked
<br/>out for dis hour!”—and they filled them up again in a
<br/>a great rage, and, sinking back in their arm chairs, puffed
<br/>away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was
<br/>immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face,
<br/>and it seemed as if old Nick himself had taken posses-
<br/>sion of everything in the shape of a time-piece. The
<br/>clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if
<br/>bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could
<br/>scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a con-
<br/>tinual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wrig-
<br/>gling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.—
<br/>But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could
<br/>put up any longer with the Behaviour of the little repeat-
<br/>era tied to their tails, and resented it by scampering all
<br/>over the place, scratching and poking, and squeaking
<br/>and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and fly-
<br/>ing into the faces, and running under the petticoats of
<br/>the people, and creating altogether the most abominable
<br/>din and confusion which it is possible for a reasona-
<br/>ble person to conceive. And to make matters still</p>
         <p/>
         <p>more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the
<br/>steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost.—
<br/>Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the
<br/>scoundrel through the smoke. There lie sat in the belfry
<br/>upon the belfry-man, who Was lying flat upon his back.
<br/>In his teeth the villain held the hell-rope, which he kept
<br/>jerking about with his head, raising such a clatter that my
<br/>ears ring again even to think of it. On his lap lay the
<br/>big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all time
<br/>and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the nin-
<br/>compoop! of playing Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’-
<br/>Raferty.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place
<br/>In disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct
<br/>time and fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the bo-
<br/>rough, and restore the ancient order of things in Vonder-
<br/>votteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the
<br/>steeple.	EDGAR A. POE.</p>
         <p>Criticisms on Popular Errors. 
NO. II.—MORMONISM.
Error, with hopes of fame, the world inspires.
But different bosoms burn with different fires:—
One, simply wrong, a single thought misleads;
Another ten, another twenty needs,
As stomachs varying in their nerve, or bile—
This can digest a cabbage, that a tile.
Smith had but one—one error marked his plans,
But like Briareus, ’t had a hundred hands,
By which it delved within the social mind,
To make it turbid, dreamy, dull and blind;
Yet was he shrewd and firm—Mahomet’s beast,
Ne’er, reined by Eros, trod more duly East.
Unlike Busha, no honors o’er this chief
E’er cast the driest baccalaureate leaf.
Bred to the plough, and taught the tree to fell,
He baulked at science, or he scarce could spell,
A better prophet! So his followers thought;–
Gills, visions, fiats, were in all he wrought,
And much he wrought, and many a vision tried,
Since erst he dug upon Cumorah’s side.
“Religion”—thus discoursed the prophet Smith—
"Hath lost, through erring men, its germ and pith;
And, viewed in every varying Christian creed,
Is bat a hollow, traitless, sapless reed;
AU virtue gone—priests, pastors, churches, men,
Bishop and layman, sermon, book, and pen,
All that conspires to raise the system broad,
Is one commingled mass of cant and fraud.*
“So mused I at Palmyra. To my mind,
“Some other revelation heaven designed,
Some system less inclined to split or fall,
Than that foretold by John, or preached by Paul,
</p>
         <p>Or if not diverse, in th’ Almighty plan
<br/>To be promulged by some heaven-ordered man
<br/>Of latter days. Faith on my vision paints
<br/>That glorious day—the Day of Latter Saints.</p>
         <p>A prophet, sure, should come among his peers,
Oftener than once in eighteen hundred years,
Nor coold a fitter place than this invite.
Where KLUNEOLUX once received the rite.†
“The world itself”—th’ inspirer thus went on—

necessary to condemn all the old sects, in order to show the importance of a 
new one. See Pratt's Account of Several Remarkable Disco eres, &amp;c.—

Iron in his ner.ves.and thunder in his tone,
</p>
         <p>"The world itself was rolling' very rough
<br/>In Christian morals, when I cried enough!
<br/>Let earth go ploughless, trees remain uncut,</p>
         <p>While my strong shoulders to the wheels I pull
—These golden plates, I will myself translate,
And read to man the miracles of fate:
How Israel herd, in days we fancy old,
Trod in. his pride, bedlight in Ophir gold,
And warred and wandered, leader, priest, arid host,
Far from his cava hearts-loved, and sacred coast,
Till whelmed in fate and heaven-opposing will,'
In wrath he perished on Cumorah bill.”
He paused and breathed,—the listening throng admired,
And wonder deep each rustic bosom fired;
For note it, in the rise of mundane chief,
Nought is so rife in masses, as belief.
This gave to Munster John* his power and rod,
And sealed the Koran as the word of God.
I said the Mormon chief was shrewd—his eye
Was rather set th' expedient to espy—
Means, justifying, in his view, all eads,
Truth growing strong, by fraud, deceit and fiends.
He knew how hope in vulgar bosoms springs,
And grew by cunning, great in little things.
One triumph more!—and he had gained his crown
It was to win—a pious man's renown.
"Contrition”—he resumed the mystic strain—
"O’er whelmed my soul, and filled my teeming brain.
Churches on churches, whirled around my head,
Ages and countries, living—future—dead!
A chaos of dread symbols. Of myself,
And my condition on earth’s fragile shelf,
I even saw no prospect, or retreat,
No safety in mere earth-directed feet,
Or creed or dogma—nor this war to quell,
Aught to redeem from incandescent hell.
“To pray, at length, I went, and in a wood
First gave admittance to a contrite mood.
But not yet versed in using prayer aright,
[Hypocrisy is frugal] drew a flood of light,
And stood within it—angels stood around
And cried—lo! yonder hill is sacred ground,
All sects are veering, wrong, or heterodox,—
Go to the spot, and thou shall find a box—
Dig and reveal! within the sacred space
Thou shall thy Maker’s wilt sublimely trace,
Engraved on golden plates, in language eld,
Such as in Asian temples once was held.
Dig and reveal! nor ploughs nor forests mind!
Thou shall reveal the knowledge lo mankind.”†
Fraud, blasphemy and vice triumphant sprang,
And new fledged Baalim songs? of victory sang.
So Mormon ism rose, but not so died:—
See, to the West extends the gathering tide,
Like some great river of my native land,
That, swelled with floods, sweeps over fields of sand.
Driftwood and rubbish, motley and unclean,
Float on the wave, and crowd the feccant scene,
Till, in vast swamp, it flings the turbid load,
The serpent’s nest, and hydra’s dread abode,
In sweltering heals, the deadly vapors rise,
To taint the air, and man, the victim, dies.
Thus the vile tenet sucks up as it runs,
The intellectual filth of western suns—
The mind’s malaria! sick of wholesome food,
It gluts on lies, hypocrisy and blood.

         <p>The Artist, The Merchant and The Statesman, of the
<br/>Age of the Medici, and of our own Times. By C.
<br/>Edwards Lester, U. S., Consul at Genoa, Author of
<br/>“The Glory and Shame of England," etc. etc. In
<br/>Two Volumes. Vol. 1. New- York: Paine A Bur-
<br/>gess.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have been much interested in this volume, and
<br/>shall take occasion to speak of it folly hereafter:—at
<br/>present it can hardly be considered as before the public.
<br/>The contents are ‘‘A Letter on the Genius and Sculp-
<br/>tures of Powers”—“An Apology for Powers”—“Conver-
<br/>sations with Powers in his Studio at Florence—Serving
<br/>as an Autobiography of the Scnlptor—with a History of
<br/>his Life and Works”—Tuckerman’s Letter on the
<br/>Genins of Powers”—and “A Letter on the Establishment
<br/>of a New Consular System in the United States, with

<br/>tablishments of Ancient and Modem Nations—the Evils
<br/>of our Present System etc. etc.—Addressed to the Hon.

         <p>A Complete System of Latin Prosody, for the use of

<br/>entirely New. By Patrick S; Casserly, formerly Prin-
<br/>cipal of the Chrestomathic Institutions, etc. etc, New-
<br/>York: Casserly &amp; Sons, 108 Nassau St.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Casserly has acquired a deserved reputation as a
<br/>teacher, and as the literal translator of Longinus—also
<br/>by his Jacob’s “Greek Reader.” He is undoubtedly one
<br/>of our best scholars, and the volume before us will do
<br/>him infinite credit. Its comprehensiveness is especially
<br/>notables but the author is sadly in error, we think, in
<br/>supposing that Latin Prosody, any more than Latin Syn-
<br/>tax, can be best studied in Latin rules. We are glad to
<br/>find that he has not carried his system so far as to ex-
<br/>clude the use of English rules, for those who prefer them.
<br/>His Latin Hexameters are translated. The volume is,
<br/>in general, accurately printed, but has some errors—vide

         <p>Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, for November, opens with
<br/>an admirable paper, by C. Fenno Hoffman, on “The Po-
<br/>etry of Trade.” Its second article is from the pen of H.
<br/>Middleton Jr. of S. C., and is Chapter IV. of the thought-
<br/>ful series of essays on “The Government and the Cur-
<br/>rency,” which have done so much for the character of
<br/>the Magazine. Nothing so good, on the same subjects,
<br/>has as yet appeared in America. The other papers are
<br/>“Trade and Commerce of Mobile”; “The First Coal
<br/>Region of Pennsylvania”; “What is a Revenue Tariff?”;</p>
         <p/>
         <p> “Maritime Law—No. 8”; and “Railroad Movement in
<br/>Virginia.” The last article is especially important and
<br/>interesting. The usual “Commercial Chronicle,” Sta-
<br/>tistics, and Book Criticisms, fill up the number, which
<br/>altogether is one of the best yet issued.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Of the editor of “The Merchant’s Magazine” we have
<br/>more than once expressed our opinion—that he is one of
<br/>the most remarkable men of his day; and we have now
<br/>lying by us an article from the pen of Willis which
<br/>speaks very much to the same purpose. There is not
<br/>one of our readers who will not forgive us for quoting it:
<br/>Hunt has been glorified in the Hong-kong Gazette, is regularly
<br/>complimented by the English mercantile authorities, has every
<br/>Banker in the world lor an eager subscriber, every Consul, every
<br/>Ship-owner, and Navigator—is filed away as authority in every
<br/>library, and thought of, in hall the countries of the world, as early
<br/>as No. 3, in their enumeration of distinguished Americans—yet,
<br/>who seeks to do him honor in the city he does honor to? The
<br/>Merchant’s Magazine, though a prodigy of perseverance and in-
<br/>dustry, is not an accidental developement of Hunt’s energies He
<br/>has always been singularly sagacious and original in devising new
<br/>works and good ones. He was the founder of the first ‘Ladies'
<br/>Magazine,’ of the first ‘Children’s Periodical,’ he started the
<br/> American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge,’
<br/>compiled the best known collection of American Anecdotes, and
<br/>is an indefatigable writer—the author, among other things, of
<br/>‘Letters about the Hudson.’ A mutual Inend of Hunt and ourself
<br/>says of him:—‘His most important labor was the projection and
<br/>successful establishment of the ‘Merchant’s Magazine and Com-
<br/>mercial Re-view.’ Having had the means of ascertaining the pre-
<br/>cise wants of the commercial public, and knowing that almost eve-
<br/>ry other class of our population possessed its appropriate work, he
<br/>conceived that a magazine and review, devoid to the interests of
<br/>that large, wealthy, and respectable class, the merchants—a work
<br/>which should be thoroughly practical and national in its character,
<br/>embodying commercial matter, literary and statistical, having a
<br/>national bearing upon their interests and intelligence, and support-
<br/>ed by ripe and disciplined minds, would be a desideratum. This
<br/>national work, tending to inform us of the causes which bad acted
<br/>upon our trade and commerce in times past, and the expanding
<br/>growth of our country, he has at length brought out with full suc-
<br/>cess. In his periodical he has opened a new vein of thought, espe-
<br/>cially adapted to the peculiar cast of our American minds, and
<br/>erected a monument which will endure.’</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page276"/>
         </p>
         <p>Hunt was a playfellow of ours in round-jacket days, and we
<br/>have always looked at him with a reminiscent interest. Ilis lu-
<br/>minous eager eyes, as he goes along the street keenly bent on his
<br/>errand, would impress any observer with an idea of his genius and
<br/>determination, and we think it is quite time his earnest head was
<br/>in the engraver’s hand, and his daily passing-by, a mark for the
<br/>digito monstrari. Few more valuable or more note-worthy citizens
<br/>arc among us.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“The Merchant’s Magazine” was, indeed, one of those
<br/>“happy ideas,” as they are weakly termed, which enter
<br/>the heads of men of genius alone. The execution of the
<br/>scheme was not less happy than its conception. At the
<br/>time, Mr. H. had not only not a dollar, but was much in-
<br/>volved. Ilis friends (?) too discouraged him - as friends
<br/>in such cases always do. He persevered; made personal
<br/>application to those who would understand and appreci-
<br/>ate his enterprize; suffered no labor nor repulse to deter
<br/>him; and in the end (without embarrassing himself with
<br/>a partner) succeeded in establishing on the firmest
<br/>basis a Magazine, which, independently of its liter-
<br/>ary, or commercial utility, is decidedly the best property
<br/>of any similar journal in the world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Aristidean, for October, is even unusually rich—
<br/>containing some of the most forcible Magazine papers
<br/>we have even seen:—for example, “Leaves from a Log-
<br/>book”—“The Water Cure”—“The Cobbler of Cobbs-
<br/>town”—“Petrus, the Painter”—“Philosophy, a Farce”
<br/>“The Siege of Orleans”—and a queer article on “Ameri-
<br/>can Poets.” A press of advertisements forces us to post-
<br/>pone farther comments until next week.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The American Review, for November, commences with
<br/>an able paper on “Human Rights”—a review of Hurl-
<br/>but’s Essay—continued from last number. We note, also,
<br/>an excellent article on “The French Moralists—La-
<br/>bruyerc, Montaigne and Nicole,” also, a continuation of
<br/>the spicy “Adventures on the Frontiers of Texas and
<br/>Mexico.” There are several other excellent contributions
<br/>in prose—including a fair criticism on Mr. Mathews'
<br/>book.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are two remarkably fine poems in the number—
<br/>“The True Death,” by Wm. Wallace, and “Elfland,”
<br/>anonymous.</p>
         <p>The “Critical Notices” are written with point and
discrimination.
</p>
         <p>The Knickerbocker Magazine, for November, is really
<br/>beneath notice and beneath contempt. And yet this
<br/>work wa3, at one time, respectable. We should regret,
<br/>for the sake of New York literature, that a journal of
<br/>this kind should perish, and through sheer imbecility on
<br/>the part of its conductors. Its present circulation, we
<br/>believe, is not more than 1400 at the most. Its friends
<br/>should come to its rescue.</p>
         <p>The Fine Arts. 
</p>
         <p>Under this head we have very little to observe. Titi-
<br/>an’s Venus—concerning which we had some remarks in
<br/>a previous number—is again being exhibited in Broad-
<br/>way. Its authenticity, we believe, is sufficiently well
<br/>established—but we cannot force ourselves into any very
<br/>enthusiastic admiration of the work. As a composition
<br/>it is full of defects. Its color alone redeems it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We refer our readers to Mr. Lester’s new book, “The
<br/>Artist, The Merchant, and The Statesman,” for a great
<br/>many interesting details respecting Powers, the Sculptor.</p>
         <p>At the rooms of the Art Union there are two very ex-
</p>
         <p>quisite landscapes by Shaw—an artist whose merits (all
<br/>of the loftiest order) will perhaps never be appreciated
<br/> by his countrymen, until Death has mellowed down some
<br/> of the personal ill-will with which his brother artists re-
<br/>gard him. His mannerisms (sufficiently obvious) affect
<br/>only the aggregate of his pictures. Individually, no-
<br/>thing can surpass some of his best works—“The Indian’s
<br/>First sight of a Ship,” for example.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Bust or Mr. Calhoun.—Mr. Clark Mills, a native artist,
<br/>whose busts in plaster, actually moulded on the human head
<br/>and face, have excited such general admiration, by their truth
<br/>to life, has recently, as we predicted on a former occasion, made a
<br/>successful attempt in a higher branch of art. From a block of
<br/>native white free-stone, procured near Columbia in this Slate, he
<br/>has sculptnred, with hammer and chisel, a stone bust of the great
<br/>Southern Statesman, (his first attempt in this line,) in a manner
<br/>that speaks well for the skill and taste of the artist. We propose
<br/>that, when completed and approved, the City Council of Charles-
<br/>ton should make public property of this likeness of our great na-
<br/>tive state-man, hewn, by a native artist, cut of a block of native
<br/>stone.—Charleston Cour.</p>
         <p>The Drama.
</p>
         <p>Mr. Murdoch closed his engagement at the Park The-
<br/>atre on Friday evening of last week, taking his benefit be-
<br/>fore a large audience, playing Macbeth, and Charles Par-
<br/>agon in “Perfection." He played, on the Wednesday
<br/>previous, Claude Melnotte to an excellent house. These
<br/>personations have not dimished the young actor’s hold on
<br/>the public favor; tin y have in some respects strength-
<br/>ened it, and increased confidence in the extent and vari-
<br/>ety of his power. His Macbeth was regarded by many
<br/>as his best performance, although for our own part, we
<br/>prefer his Othello in the closing act, and various pas-
<br/>sages ol great effect in his Claude Melnotte. In all the
<br/>range of the drama there is scarcely a part more ar-
<br/>duous than that of Macbeth; requiring as it does a con-
<br/>stantly sustained power, an aspect of dread and superna-
<br/>tural soliciting, and the continuous expression of a spirit
<br/>deepening on in crime, wracked with keen agonies at
<br/>every step, to the end. Through this severe labour, Mr.
<br/>Murdoch made his way, triumphantly: better in some
<br/>parts than in others; lingering a little by the way in the
<br/>intervals of the greater outbreaks of passion, and not
<br/>always keeping himself as close to the work as he should:
<br/>failing to intensify each lineament and feature—but leav-
<br/>ing in the mind, withal, a conviction that the whole had
<br/>been successfully accomplished, by an artist of a high
<br/>order of merit. The admirable feeling and expression in
<br/>the delivery of some portions of the play we can never
<br/>forget. His ‘Wake Duncan with your knocking:' his
<br/>heart-broken farewell to ‘Sleep’: his expression of coun-
<br/>tenance in the dagger-scene, and the magnificent, rolling
<br/>tones of his voice in The multitudinous seas incarna-
<br/>dine’ are a part of memory itself.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In Claude Melnotte his description of the palace on
<br/>the lake of Como was a master-piece of recitation; his
<br/>parting with Pauline, for the army, perfect in the voice
<br/>with which he gave it, the gesture that accompanied it,
<br/>and the wild eager haste with which he snatched him-
<br/>self away. At times in the course of this admirable per-
<br/>sonation, it was almost impossible to restrain the enthu-
<br/>siasm of the audience; there was a strong desire mani-
<br/>fested to call him out in the Third and Fifth Acts, before
<br/>the curtain fell. In the little after-piece on his benefit-
<br/>night he played the light, dashing, off-hand Paragon
<br/>with great spirit, and kept the audience pleased to the
<br/>close.</p>

</p>
         <p>At the end of the performances he was summoned before
<br/>the curtain and delivered the following speech, which
<br/>was rapturously welcomed, and which we place on record
<br/>for future reference. We have many reflections spring-
<br/>ing from this success of Mr. Murdoch’s, and the new
<br/>light it casts upon our present Drama, to lay before our
<br/>readers hereafter.</p>
         <p>La dies and Gentlemen:
</p>

<br/>you were pleased to give me your favor; night after night you
<br/>have gladdened my heart, by respectful attention and kind ap-
<br/>plause.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Though words may fail to express my gratitude, my heart is 
<br/>full to overflowing. To the kind friends who have greeted me
<br/>here, and to the entire press of this city, I owe my life-long thanks
<br/>lor the unanimous and generous support they have given me.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to address a lew
<br/>words to you, upon a subject ever near my own heart, and which 
<br/>I am sure finds a corner in the hearts of ail who regard the intel-
<br/>lectual development of this land of their birth or of their adop-
<br/>tion.	</p>
         <p/>
         <p>England, France, and Spain possess a national Drama—which
<br/>is their pride and boast—abounding in graphic pictures of national 
<br/>character, where all of good, and beamy, and greatness belonging
<br/>to a nation is faithfully chronicled.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>From certain givings forth of the popular mind, I may venture
<br/>to say, that, in the mighty work which the present generation is
<br/>destined to perform on this side of the Atlantic, the building up of
<br/>a new Drama is a prominent object,—a drama bearing the spirit
<br/>of our own common country, marked with the living features of
<br/>humanity, and a bold outline of manners as they exist at present,
<br/>and as they existed at that period when the founders of a young
<br/>republic acted well their part.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Descended from a land which gave birth to a Shakspeare, what
<br/>shall prevent our young writers from moulding into a dramatic
<br/> form the rich materials which lie spread over the “pages of our
<br/>common country’s history?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Let them begin the work whose end is to raise the genius
<br/>and to mend the heart, and a generous public will cheer them on
<br/>till they form a centre for the drama, around which higher aspir-
<br/>ations shall cluster and shine.</p>
         <p>"Hoping that I may live to take part in such scenes, I now,
ladies and gentlemen, bid yon (lor the present) farewell.
“To one and all, I repeat my heart’s thanks and farewell!”

The two ensuing weeks will be exceedingly rich as
far as Music is concerned.
</p>
         <p>Leopold De Mever has announced his first Concert for
<br/>Friday, the 7th of November. It will take place at the
<br/>Tabernacle, and a great many who object to going to
<br/>Theatres, will avail themselves of this opportunity, and
<br/>listen to the strains of almost supernatural music he
<br/>draws out of his splendid Grand Piano. We have not
<br/>seen the programme yet, but we trust that Mr. De
<br/>Meyer’s selections will satisfy all the lovers of good mu-
<br/>sic.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>U. C. Hill’s Concert already mentioned in our last,
<br/>will be on Monday, the 10th of November, and a rich
<br/>bill he offers to the public.</p>

         <p>Miss Northall has just returned from a very success-
<br/>ful engagement at Toronto. She will sing at Philadel-
<br/>phia on the 6th, and be here in time to assist Mr. Leo-
<br/>pold De Meyer in his second concert.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mrs. V. Mott has announced a Grand Concert for
<br/>Thursday, the 13th of this month. Mr. Keyle, Mr.
<br/>Timm, George Loder and others will assist her on the
<br/>occasion.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>OLD Bull will probably give another very latt Con-
<br/>cert;—urged by many requests for a repetition of his last
<br/>Concert, he cannot very well refuse, as the Masonic fra-
<br/>ternity have taken all the credit of his last Farewell.</p>
         <p>Auber's La Bayadere is drawing crowded houses at

         <p>Cheap Music.—Cheap literature is somewhat a stale
<br/> subject with us now, but cheap music has all the advan-
<br/>tage of novelty, and it has yet some farther advantages;
<br/>for when the novelty is worn off, its excellence and cheap-
<br/>ness will still remain. We have before us a book of songs
<br/>—six songs—sixteen pages—admirably got up in every
<br/>way, printing, paper, selection, and elegance of style, and
<br/>sold for the small sum of twenty-five cents! We cannot
<br/>understand how the publisher can afford to sell at such a
<br/>price, and yet make a living; for this work, unlike the
<br/>usual style of stereotype music, is really given to the public
<br/>in beautiful form, and of durable materials. It is called the
<br/>Musical World and is published on the Island loth of every
<br/>month by Homans &amp; Ellis, 205 Broadway, the Editorial
<br/>charge being confided to Mr. Henry C. Watson, whose
<br/>musical reputation will be security for the excellence of
<br/>the contents of the numbers. Besides the music, the
<br/>cover contains the Journal of the Musical World, a peri-
<br/>odical devoted to musical biography, criticism and intel-
<br/>ligence, home and foreign, so that, to use the words of
<br/>the Prospectus—the Musical World forms at once a
<br/>choice and extensive Library of Music and a Journal of
<br/>Musical Events.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The work is certain, from its undoubted worth, to com-
<br/>mand the attention of the public, and the sale will be
<br/>large, for the demand for music throughout the country is
<br/>enormous. We recommend the Musical World to all our
<br/>readers. Terms of subscriptions, etc. etc. can be learned
<br/>through the advertisements.</p>
         <p>Editorial Miscellany.
</p>
         <p>Martin Farquhar Topper, Mr. Hooker, Wiley &amp;
<br/>Putnam, and International Copyright.—The facts in
<br/>this case are worth putting upon record as an indication
<br/>of the movement in favor of International Copyright.—
<br/>They have been brought before the public by Mr. Hook-
<br/>er’s publication of a ‘Card’ and the ‘Imprimatur’ of Mr.
<br/>Tupper, the book in dispute being the ‘Proverbial Philo-
<br/>sophy.’ Mr. Hooker published an edition of this work
<br/>before the author was generally known, issued it at a high
<br/>price, and it was going off slowly when the author pub-
<br/>lished a popular novel, 'The Crock of Gold’, at first re-
<br/>issued in America in a shilling edition, and subsequently
<br/>included in Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library of Choice
<br/>Reading. Mr. Willis also began to write about Mr. Tup-
<br/>per, and meeting with him in England, gave a great im-
<br/>pulse to his American reputation by telling the people in
<br/>his letters that he was a brilliant young man, quite a vi-
<br/>gorous plain spoken moralist (as his writings show) and
<br/>that he was not at all dependent upon literature as a
<br/>profession, being in the enjoyment of a city and country
<br/>house, &amp;c. &amp;c: Then it came to pass how under differ-
<br/>ent circumstances Pope had spoken a truth of human na-
<br/>ture in his couplet—</p>
         <p>Let but a Lord once own the happy Days, 
How the wit brightens and the sense refines.
</p>
         <p>Mr. Tupper was not, indeed, a lord, but the imputation
<br/>of wealth scoured the wit and purified the sense just as
<br/>well. The public admired wealth, and also showed that
<br/>it knew how to appreciate it, in calling for a cheap
<br/>edition of the Proverbial Philosophy. A Bostonian wit,
<br/>by the way, in a spirit of poetic enthusiasm similar to</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page278"/>
         </p>
         <p>that which once induced a “gentleman of Oxford” to
<br/>translate Milton’s Paradise Lost into prose, got up an
<br/>edition of the Proverbial Philosophy in prose too, where-
<br/>by the printer was cheated out of his “fat” without the
<br/>publisher, we presume, dining any better for the opera-
<br/>tion, either. Mr. Tupper brandished his 'Imprimatur’
<br/>and held on to his price. Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam are
<br/>urged to print the work in the Library of Choice Read-
<br/>ing. Respecting the interests of Mr. Hooker they leave
<br/>it alone, when one day, without any previous knowledge
<br/>on their part of the fact, an edition appears in exact ac-
<br/>cordance with the style of the Library. Then they be-
<br/>come the purchasers of the plates, and by an arrange-
<br/>ment with Mr. Hooker publish the work in the Libra-
<br/>ry by his consent and for his benefit. In the mean time,
<br/>however, Mr. Hooker suspecting unjust interference, had
<br/>issued his card, and the “Courier” points the gun at
<br/>Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam. The explanation follows the
<br/>charge, and here the matter rests, satisfactorily for all
<br/>parties. The public get the book cheap, the piratical
<br/>copy is bought up, and is now re-christened and doing
<br/>good service for Mr. Hooker and the legitimate trade.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The moral of all this is threefold. First, that there is
<br/>no adequate protection for the right of the foreign au-
<br/>thor, though it maybe partially defended by the “courte-
<br/>sy of trade.” Second, that it is impossible at present to
<br/>sustain a book purchased of a foreign author at a price
<br/>which Will give him and his American publisher any
<br/>adequate return; and third, that the only cure of the
<br/>matter must be the passage of an International Copy-
<br/>right Law.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Towards this end we have a right, energetic and man-
<br/>ly assertion of what should be, by Mr. Tupper in his “Im-
<br/>primatur’’, similar in directness to a letter once written
<br/>on this subject by Mr. Carlyle; then an eloquent remon-
<br/>strance from Mr. Hooker, a divine and publisher, him-
<br/>self an author, pledging him to the work, and not least
<br/>a recognition by Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam of the sacred-
<br/>ness of Mr. Hooker’s contract with the author, by their
<br/>treaty for the publication of the book.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Tobacco and the Clergy.—The clergy, with most
<br/>scholars, are great lovers of the weed. The smoke, they
<br/>say, is the best lexicon to the intricacies of an old folio.
<br/>One among the number, however, has turned traitor—
<br/>the Rev. Benjamin I. Lane—and published his book on
<br/>the other side. Per contra, we have according to Mr.
<br/>Willis, the ladies assuming the cigar, the coquetry of
<br/>the cigarito for the coquetry of the fan. and the follow-
<br/>ing piece of poetry, written by a clergyman—argumen-
<br/>tum ad hominem to the reverend author. The Morning
<br/>News says:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It is fair to set off one divine as authority against another, so we
<br/>give a poem, quoted in Washington Irving’s Analectic Magazine
<br/>from the European Magazine, of Sept. 1812, the second pan of
<br/>which was written by Rev. Ralph Erskine, of the Church of Scot-
<br/>land, entitled—</p>
         <p>SMOKING SPIRITUALZED.
PART I.
This Indian weed, now wither’d quite,
Though green at noon, cut down at night,
Shows thy decay;
All flesh is hay.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
The pipe, so lily-like and weak,
Does thus thy mortal state bespeak,
Thou art e’en such,
Gone with a touch.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
And when the smoke ascends on high,
Then thou behold'st the vanity
Of worldly stuff,
Gone, with a puff.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco,
And when the pipe grows foul within,
Think on thy soul defil’d with sin;
For then the fire
It does require.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
Thou seest the ashes cast away—
Then to thyself thou mayest say,
</p>
         <p>That to the dust
<br/>Return thou must
<br/>Thus think, and smoke tobacco.</p>
         <p>part II.
Was this small plant for thee cut down?
So was the plant of Great Renown,
Which mercy sends
For nobler ends.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
</p>
         <p>Doth juice medicinal proceed
<br/>From such a naughty foreign weed?
<br/>Then what’s the power
<br/>Of Jesse’s flower?
<br/>Thus think, and smoke tobacco.</p>
         <p>The promise, like the pipe, inlays,
</p>
         <p>And, by the mouth of faith, conveys
<br/>What virtue flows
<br/>From Sharon’s Rose.</p>
         <p>Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
In vain the unlighted pipe you blow;
Your pains in outward means are so;
Till heavenly fire
Your hearts inspire.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.
The smoke, like burning incense towers,
So should a praying heart of yours,
With ardent cries,
Surmount the skies.
Thus think, and smoke tobacco.

         <p>The Country Papers on American Books.—Nearly
<br/>every paper which comes to us has some cavil at Ameri-
<br/>can books, while the least particle of pretence is nour-
<br/>ished and hugged and lionized, if it only come from some
<br/>foreign Timothy Twiddlethought. It would be amusing
<br/>were it not contemptible. The habit of mind which can
<br/>see nothing good at home, whatever hypocritical ardor
<br/>may be expressed, we may be confident has no true ap-
<br/>preciation of what is good abroad. From the heart out-
<br/>ward, from the home outward, from the country outward.
<br/>Thus self discipline and self respect teach us to respect
<br/>others; the good lather, the good son form the good
<br/>citizen, and the love of country expands into the love of
<br/>human kind. It is the weakest indication of old woman-
<br/>hood to strain the eyes at something from Paris, and turn
<br/>up the nose at something, probably better, home-made.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We copy the following just tribute to a man of genius
<br/>from the “U. S. Journal.” We attribute it to the pen of
<br/>Jesse E. Dow—himself a true poet and a judge of poetry.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Poems, by William Wallace.—We are pleased to learn that
<br/>this gentleman has in press a volume of Poems, which will shortly
<br/>be issued. This will be a valuable addition to our literature.
<br/>Mr. Wallace is a true poet—one who has contributed largely to the
<br/>literary reputation of our country. Even his earliest efforts were
<br/>crowned with unusual success. A small volume of his poems,
<br/>published some six or eight years ago, was received with more
<br/>than ordinary applause. Many of the pieces contained in it bore
<br/>the stamp of a powerful and fervid imagination, an uncommon
<br/>depth of feeling, a profound, metaphysical force of thought, com-
<br/>bined with Originality and acuteness of perception. Within the
<br/>last three years he has written poetry of sufficient merit to entitle
<br/>him to rank with the first poets of the country. "Perditi,” a metri-
<br/>cal romance, first published in Graham’s Magazine, contains pas-
<br/>sages, which lor forcible delineation of the passions, vigor of lan-
<br/>guage, originality of conception, richness of imagery, and true
<br/>pathos, will bear comparison with any poetry of the age. What
<br/>could be more inspiring than his magnificent picture of the Amer-
<br/>ican battle-ship? The lovers immured in the dungeon of Lorra's
<br/>halls is equal to any thing from the pen of Maturin. He has now</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page279"/>
         </p>
         <p>a reputation—that reputation is gaining ground—and it will be his
<br/>own fault it his name should not occupy a high niche in the temple
<br/>of lame. Already he has been placed, by the ablest critic in the
<br/>country, in a notice of his poem entitled the “Gods of Old,” on
<br/>a footing with Schiller, and pronounced superior to Miss Barrett
<br/>in the conception of his subject. This curious metaphysical pro-
<br/>duction, so strikingly novel in design and execution, so replete
<br/>with bold, piercing and original thoughts, will, we-trust, tie em-
<br/>braced In the collection. But of all Mr. Wallace’s efforts,’nothing
<br/>has struck us with so much force, as his last, entitled “The
<br/>Statuary.” It is, without doubt one of the gems of the age. The
<br/>very groundwork is poetry—genuine and original. The execution,
<br/>the novelty and beauty of the figures—the boldness, truthfulness,
<br/>manliness of the language—the dread magnificence of the pictures
<br/>presented to the eye—all are beyond praise. This poem alone
<br/>would stamp the author as a man of high and noble aspirations, as
<br/>a true poet.</p>
         <p>By the way, the Express says, in referring to “The
True Death,”
</p>
         <p>The poem, the masterly poem of Wallace, The True Death, is
<br/>marred by the Tennysonism of its prefix and suffix. It Is a beautiful
<br/>performanee, however, and worthy of this impassioned poet.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This is all nonsense—as usual with the "Express.”
<br/>No man is freer from Tennysonism, or any other “ism”
<br/>than Wallace. We presume The Express alludes to
<br/>“mere,” the common property of all mankind.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Messrs. Wiley and Putnam are about to publish, si-
<br/>multaneously with the London editions to be issued im-
<br/>mediately, the Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell, by
<br/>Dr. Beattie, his friend and literary executor: a new and
<br/>complete edition of the works of Keats, with a life of
<br/>the poet by Monkton Milnes; and a new book by Leigh
<br/>Hunt, a companion to “Imagination and Fancy,” entitled
<br/>“Wit and Humor.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Southern Monthly Magazine published at Charles-
<br/>ton, and edited by Mr. Simms, will, we understand, be
<br/>merged at the end of the year in the Southern Literary
<br/>Messenger, to which journal Mr. Simms will be a con-
<br/>stant contributor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We would call particular attention to the advertise-
<br/>ment of the United States Hotel. The establishment is
<br/>most admirably conducted by the Proprietor, Mr. Johnson,
<br/>and has participated very largely in the extensive trade
<br/>of the present season. As a recherche and, at the same
<br/>time not expensive Boarding House for genteel families
<br/>during the winter, we heartily recommend the United
<br/>States.</p>

DENTISTRY.

         <p>DOCT. H. E. SCIIOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office 446
<br/>Houston St., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas'
<br/>Church.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Doct. S’s experience and skill in his profession, give him con-
<br/>fidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any
<br/>Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
<br/> varies in many essential points from the usual mode; and his suc-
<br/>cess in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
<br/>difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
<br/> of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
<br/> same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
<br/>artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
<br/>natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
<br/>natural appearance. In all these points', Doct S.’s manner is pre-
<br/>eminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to
<br/>surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
<br/>generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
<br/>makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and incases
<br/>where the gnm has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
<br/>the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
<br/>causes a contraction of the lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of
<br/>which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
<br/>which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
<br/>redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, ren-
<br/>der detection impossible.</p>
         <p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
the best families in this City, in which he has practised.

NARRATIVE OF A MISSION TO BOKHARA.
In the year 1843-45, to ascertain the fate of Col. Stoddart and
Capt. Conolly.
By the Rev. Joseph Wolff. LL.D.
</p>
         <p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<br/>England: it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<br/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<br/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<br/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<br/>East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this</p>
         <p>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
tensely interesting narrative of his experience.
</p>
         <p>"It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<br/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<br/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious
<br/>about tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that
<br/>the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirm-
<br/>ing tar too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought
<br/>to be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
<br/>its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work
<br/>is elegantly printed as a library book, and adorned by some dozen
<br/>curious fac-similes of oriental drawings." —Courier and Enquirer.</p>

         <p>*Caution. -Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in
<br/>this market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to com-
<br/>pare the Hyson tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine arti-
<br/>cle that the Company offer at the same price. The difference is so
<br/>perceptible on trial as to render any further comment unnecessary.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<br/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<br/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<br/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
<br/>price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages T. F.
<br/>Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
<br/>in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
<br/>and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpow-
<br/>der and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a com-
<br/>bination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poi-
<br/>son. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and
<br/>deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them
<br/>above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas 
<br/>retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine 
<br/>article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No one, it is presumed,
<br/>wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
<br/>giving full details on this subject, which may be ban at their
<br/>Warehouse, 75 Fulton street, tree of charge.</p>
         <p>RECOMMENDATIONS.
</p>
         <p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one dollar per
<br/>pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea
<br/>from them nt 75 cents per pound. We drink one pound per week by which
<br/>we are now saving thirteen dollars per year, arid enjoying better tea in the
<br/>bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea Company, say we—Mirror.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Pekin Tea,Company, 75 Fulton street,  are performing a great and good
<br/>work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the poor teas which
<br/>have deluged this country, Mid defrauded consumers of the article, out of the
<br/>market. They import none but pure and fragrant teas, and retail them by the

         <p>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
<br/>lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
<br/>warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors en-
<br/>ables us to bespeak for them the entire confident of the public. We know
<br/>that their Teas, both in quality and price, are nil that is stated of them. Many
<br/>a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
<br/>in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length lie has become hopeless
<br/>of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market a kind
<br/>which bad not such an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agree-
<br/>ably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
<br/>of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavors cultivated and
<br/>packed with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into ibis
<br/>country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have an Oolong,
<br/>mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
<br/>nervous persons. Its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
<br/>to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
<br/>never before drank such tea. But all tastes can here be suited, wish the great
<br/>advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, how-
<br/>ever small the quantity- The Company’s Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—

         <p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t wish to
