         <div class="head">STREET-PAVING.</div>
         <p>There is, perhaps, no point in the history of the useful arts
<br/>more remarkable than the fact, that during the last two thou-
<br/>sand years, the world has been able to make no essential
<br/>improvements in road-making. It may well be questioned
<br/>if the Gothamites of 3345 will distinguish any traces of our
<br/>Third Avenue:—and in the matter of street-pavement, pro-
<br/>perly so called, although of late, universal attention has been
<br/>directed to the subject, and experiment after experiment has
<br/>been tried, exhausting the ingenuity of all modern engineers,
<br/>it appears that we have at last settled on a result which
<br/>differs in no material degree, and in principle not at all, from
<br/>that which the Romans attained, as if instinctively, in the 
  <br/>Via Appia, the Via Flaminia, the Via Valeria, the Via Tus-
<br/>culana, and others. There are streets in Pompeii to-day
<br/>constructed on the very principle which is considered best by
<br/>the moderns: or if there be any especial variation, it cer-
<br/>tainly is not to the credit of modem ingenuity.</p>
         <p>The most durable and convenient of the Roman roads
<br/>were thus composed:—The direction and breadth were
<br/>first marked out by two shallow parrallel furrows or trench-
<br/>es (sulci) from 15 to 8 feet apart, according to the importance
<br/>of the via. The loose earth between the trenches was then
<br/>taken away, and the soil farther removed until a sufficiently
<br/>solid foundation was reached upon which to deposit the ma-
<br/>terials of the bed :—if from any cause, such as swampiness,
<br/>no such natural basis was atttainable, piles (fistucationes)
<br/>were driven. Above the natural or artificial basis (the gre-
<br/>mium) four strata were laid, of which the first (statumen)
<br/>consisted of stones about three times the size of those em-
<br/>ployed by us in Macadamizing; next came the rudus, brok-
<br/>en stones, cemented with lime (answering to our rubble-work)
<br/>—this was generally nine inches thick, and densely rammed.
<br/>Then came the nucleus of broken earthen-ware, six inches
<br/>thick, and also cemented with lime. Lastly came the true
<br/>pavement, (pavimentum) which was composed of irregular
<br/>Polygons of silex, commonly basaltic lava. These blocks,
<br/>however, were fitted together with great nicety, and pre-
<br/>sented just such an appearance as do our best built polygon-
<br/>al stone walls. The centre of the way was slightly elevated,
<br/>as with us, above the curb-stones. Now and then, in cities,
<br/>rectangular slabs of softer stone were substituted for the ir-
<br/>regular lava polygons—and here the resemblance to the fa-
<br/>vorite modern mode was nearly complete. When the road
<br/>or street passed over or through solid rock, the statumen and
<br/>rudus were neglected, but the nucleus was never dispensed
<br/>with. On each side of the way were elevated foot-paths,
<br/>gravelled, and well supported; and at regular intervals
<br/>Were stone blocks, corresponding to our own steps, for the
<br/>convenience of horsemen or carriages. Our mile-stones were
<br/>also employed.</p>
          <p>We are aware that all this is very school-boyish informa-
<br/>tion— but we venture to place it before our readers by way
<br/>of fairly collating the ancient and modem ideas on the gene-
<br/>ral topic of road-making, and by way, also, of insisting on<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
   the observation with which we commenced—that it is ex-
<br/>ceedingly remarkable how little we have done to advance
<br/>an art of so vast an importance, notwithstanding the contin-
<br/>uous endeavors which have been made, and are still mak-
<br/>ing, to advance it.</p>
         <p>The Roman road (and our own quadrangular stone-block
<br/>pavement is but a weak imitation of it) is beyond doubt ex-
<br/>ceedingly durable; and, so far, wherever the experiment
<br/>has been tried, it has fully succeeded. By so far we mean
<br/>so far as concerns durability. The objections are first, its
<br/>cost, which is very great when the proper material is em-
<br/>ployed ; and secondly the street din which is wrought by
<br/>the necessity of having the upper surfaces of the blocks
<br/>roughened, to afford a hold for the hoof. The noise from
<br/>these roughened stones is less, certainly, than the tintamar-
<br/>re proceeding from the round ones—but nevertheless is in-
<br/>tolerable still. The first objection (cost) is trivial where
<br/>funds are at command ; for in the end this species of pave-
<br/>ment is the cheapest which has ever been invented, or prob-
<br/>ably ever will be invented—for repairs are scarcely needed
<br/>at all. But it is cheap only in a save-at-the-spigot under-
<br/>standing of the term—for our second objection is one of a vi-
<br/>tal importance. The loss of time (not to mention temper)
<br/>through the insufferable nuisance of street-noise in many of
<br/>our most frequented thoroughfares, would overwhelm all
<br/>reasonable people with astonishment if but once fairly and
<br/>mathematically put ; and that time is money—to an Ameri-
<br/>can at least—is a proposition not for an instant to be disput-
<br/>ed. Nor have we dwelt upon the vast inconvenience, and
<br/>often fatal injury resulting to invalids from the nuisance of
<br/>which we complain—and of which all classes complain,
<br/>without ever mentioning the necessity of getting it abated.</p>
         <p>It is generally admitted, we believe, that as long as they
<br/>last, the wooden pavements have the advantage over all oth-
<br/>ers. They occasion little noise (we place this item first and
<br/>are serious in so placing it as the most important considera-
<br/>tion of all); they are kept clean with little labor; they save
<br/>a great deal in horse power ; they are pleasant to the hoof
<br/>and thus save the health of the horse—as well as some twen-
<br/>ty or thirty per cent, in the wear and tear of vehicles—and as
<br/>much more, in time, to all travellers through the increased
<br/>rapidity of passage to and fro.</p>
         <p>The first objection is that of injury to the public health
<br/>from miasmata arising from the wood. Whether such injury
<br/>actually does occur is very questionable—but there is no need
<br/>of mooting the question, since all admit that the source of
<br/>the miasma (decay) can be prevented. It is demonstrated
<br/>that by the process very improperly called Kyanizing (since
<br/>Kyan has not the slightest claim to the invention) even the
<br/>greenest wood may be preserved for centuries, or if need be
<br/>for a hundred, or far more. The experiments by which this
<br/>fact is, as we say, demonstrated, have been tried in every
<br/>variety of way, with nearly identical results. Elocks prop-
<br/>erly prepared, for example, were subjected for many years,
<br/>in the fungus pit of the dockyard at Woolwich, England, to</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page242"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>all the known decomposing agents which can ever naturally
<br/>be brought to act against a wooden pavement, and yet were
<br/>taken from the pit, at the close of the experiments, in as
<br/>sound a condition as when originally deposited.</p>
         <p>The preservative agent employed was that of corrosive
<br/>sublimate—the Bi-chloride of Mercury. Let a pound of the
<br/>sublimate be dissolved in fifteen or sixteen gallons of wa-
<br/>ter, and a piece of any wood (not decayed) be immersed for
<br/>seventy-two hours in the solution, and the wood cannot af-
<br/>terwards be rotted. An instantaneous mineralization can be
<br/>effected, if necessary, by injection of the fluid in vacuo into
<br/>the pores of the wood. It is rendered much heavier, and
<br/>more brittle by the process, and has altogether a slightly
<br/>metallic character.</p>
         <p>The cost of the Bi-chloride of Mercury is we presume, at
<br/>present, something less than one dollar per pound—but the
<br/>cost would be greatly reduced should the mineralizing pro-
<br/>cess occasion an unusual demand. The South American
<br/>quicksilver mines, now unworked, would be put into opera-
<br/>tion, and we should get the article, perhaps, for forty or even
<br/>thirty cents per pound. But even now the cost of Kyanizing
<br/>is trifling in comparison with that of cutting, squaring, and
<br/>roughening stone—to say nothing of the difference in cost
<br/>between wood itself, and such stone as our present pavements
<br/>demand.</p>
         <p>Decay being thus prevented, all danger from miasma is of
<br/>course to be left out of question ; and although it has been
<br/>frequently assert d that the mercurial effluvium is injurious
<br/>to health—the assertion has been as frequently refuted in the
<br/>most positive and satisfactory manner. The mercury is too
<br/>closely assimilated with the wooden fibre to admit of any
<br/>perceptible effluvium. Even where sailors have lived for
<br/>months in the most confined holds of vessels built of the min-
<br/>eralized wood, no ill consequences have been found to arise.</p>
         <p>We write this article with no books before us, and are
<br/>by no means positive about the accuracy of our details. The
<br/>general principles and facts, however, are not, we believe,
<br/>matters of dispute. We confess ourselves, therefore, at a
<br/>loss to understand how, or why it is, that a Kyanized wood-
<br/>en pavement to a limited extent, has not been laid (if only
<br/>by way of a forlorn-hope-like experiment) in some of our
<br/>public thoroughfares. Or are we merely ignorant of the
<br/>case—and has the experiment been fairly tried, and found
  <br/>wanting ?</p>

         <div class="head">AMUSEMENTS OF NEW YORK.</div>
         <p>The supposed proneness of Americans (United Statesers)
<br/>to labor too much and play too little, has long been a subject
<br/>of reproach with foreigners, and of complaint among our own
<br/>countrymen. One of our magazines a short time since con-
<br/>tained a homily from a city clergyman, in which the evils of
<br/>too great seriousness of demeanor were forcibly set forth, and
<br/>people were urged to give more time to recreation and less to
<br/>business, in a very impressive and serious manner. But these
<br/>reproaches and complaints are made with a total blindness to
<br/>the statistics of fun, and with little argument as to the truth
<br/>of the assumption that Americans are not food of amuse-
<br/>ments. It is true that we have nothing that resembles the
<br/>impromptu cotillions which seem to belong to the soil of
<br/>France, and that fandangos and polkas are not danced by our
<br/>Broadway ladies in the Park and Bowling-Green; but we
<br/>doubt whether there are more dancers in Paris, if the figu-
<br/>rantes of the opera be excepted, than there are in New
<br/>York. In France they dance by daylight in the open air, for
<br/>economy’s sake, but here they dance at night in well lighted
<br/>rooms. The French dance, as though dancing were a matter</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>of course, in a trifling light-hearted manner; here we make
<br/>a serious business of it, and amuse ourselves in this manner
<br/>as though it were a duty. Our balls are conducted with as
<br/>much solemnity and consideration as our courts or elections.
<br/>Committees are appointed to make suitable arrangements ;
<br/>guests are invited in a precise sedate mannner, and they dress
<br/>themselves with elaborate care, to show that they are fully
<br/>impressed with the importance of the act in which they are
<br/>to engage, namely—to amuse themselves. Instead of that
<br/>light and frivolous behaviour which the French manifest on
<br/>such occasions, showing that they have no sense of the true
<br/>aim of amusement, which is to improve the health and
<br/>spirits, our people prove by their solemnity of carriage and
<br/>gravity of face, that they fully understand what they are
<br/>about, and that they have engaged in their amusements with
<br/>an intelligent appreciation of their importance. You may
<br/>sometimes observe an auctioneer who has rattled away at
<br/>his vocation all day as light-hearted as a parrot, and as full
<br/>of grimace as a monkey, go to his amusements with his wife
<br/>in the evening as sedate and well behaved as a judge. So
<br/>there are lawyers and judges, as thoughtless as crickets
<br/>while engaged in the business of their clients, bandying jokes
<br/>and making awful puns in law Latin, who will go to a ball
<br/>or a soirée as seriously as though they were disappointed
<br/>clients. This resolute determination to be amused certainly
<br/>manifests anything but an indifference to recreations, and it
<br/>is very plain that the foreigners who have complained of our
<br/>too close application to business, took but a very superficial
<br/>view of the national idiosyncrasies. Mr. Dickens looked out
<br/>from the windows of the Carbon House the day after his
<br/>arrival in New York, and not seeing any dancing monkeys
<br/>or organ-grinders in Broadway, directly wrote down in his
<br/>Diary that we had no amusements. But of all other men in
<br/>the world he should have been the last to accuse us of a dis-
<br/>inclination to amuse ourselves, for it was made a gala day
<br/>whenever he appeared.</p>
         <p>The public amusements of New York are very numerous ;
<br/>a glance at one of the morning papers, will at any time dis-
<br/>cover a greater number of public places of amusement than
<br/>any city in Europe of the same extent can show. There are at
<br/>all times six theatres and a circus open nightly, while there
<br/>are two other theatres closed, on account of the season. Be-
<br/>sides these theatres, there are two museums where dramatic
<br/>entertainments are presented, and every night in the week
<br/>there are dramatic readings and singing in public lecture
<br/>rooms. The places where free entertainments, in the shape
<br/>of music and singing are given, are very numerous, and pri-
<br/>vate balls and parties are innumerable.</p>
         <p>The theatres, which are generally looked upon as places
<br/>of amusement only, are generally exceedingly dull and som-
<br/>bre ; and people who wish to enjoy a hearty laugh, resort to
<br/>the company of a few choice fellows who have the reputa-
<br/>tion of saying good things, or seek the companionship of some
<br/>author who can be warranted not to tire.</p>
         <p>Amusement should be spontaneous, or rather there can be
<br/>no amusement which is not so. The theatre should afford
<br/>amusement, pastime and instruction, but it rarely affords
<br/>either, and still more rarely the three combined. There is
<br/>evidence enough around us that we are an amusement seek-
<br/>ing people, and that we do not, as has been falsely charged,
<br/>give too much of our lime to serious business; if we gave
<br/>more we should doubtless be benefitted by it.</p>
         <p>But we seek our amusements in our own way, and foreign
<br/>visiters, missing the street shows to which they have been
<br/>accustomed, very irrationally set us down in their diaries as
<br/>an overtasked people, who sacrifice every enjoyment to the
<br/>almighty dollar.</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page243"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>The city governors have always indulged freely in recrea-
<br/>tions, setting an example to the people which they have not
<br/>been slow to imitate; but if they should spend part of the
<br/>time which they devote to feasting and merry-making, in
<br/>devising means to keep the streets in a healthy condition, the
<br/>people would hardly complain that they overtasked them-
<br/>selves with hard labor.</p>
         <p>A walk through Broadway of a sunny morning to a man
<br/>of business as he goes to his office, would be recreation
<br/>enough to sweeten his hours of toil, but in the present con-
<br/>dition of our noble thoroughfare, it is a weariness and dis-
<br/>gust to make one’s way through it. The past week it has
<br/>been perilous to the lungs and the eyes, and certain ruin to
<br/>one’s clothes. Clouds of dust, soot, ashes, pulverised bricks,
<br/>and all manner of dried substances which have been ground
<br/>beneath the wheels of incessant omnibuses, have been drift-
<br/>ing about in dense masses; the raw wind rushing through
<br/>the narrow streets, though apparently impatient to escape
<br/>from such unpleasant places, will stop in Broadway on pur-
<br/>pose to play with the dust, and fling it into the eyes and nos-
<br/>trils of pedestrians. Yet people who suffer these inconve-
<br/>niences will yet talk of amusements, and allow their servants,
<br/>the rulers of the city, to amuse themselves, while their
<br/>grievances are unredressed. Nero has been condemned to
<br/>infamous notoriety, for amusing himself with his fiddle while
<br/>Rome was burning; but the spectacle of our mayor and alder,
<br/>men taking a pleasure excursion in a steamboat, or feasting
<br/>themselves at Bellevue, while the highways of the city are
<br/>choked with dirt, and the inhabitants are suffocated with
<br/>dust, is a sight to make the world forget Nero and his fiddle.</p>
         <p>If a stranger to our country should desire to get a correct
<br/>idea of the earnestness with which we pursue the phantom
<br/>pleasure, let him behold the indomitable perseverance which
<br/>our citizens have shown in the determination to extract en-
<br/>joyment from the representation of Fashion at the Park thea-
<br/>tre, and of Antigone at Mr. Dinneford’s; a disinterested ob-
<br/>server would be convinced that people who went so seriously
<br/>to work in seeking their amusements, should not be taxed
<br/>with the sin of devoting too much time to business matters.</p>
      </div>
  
  
      <div>
         <div class="head">REFORM.</div>
         <p>One of those innocent persons who conceive themselves to
<br/>have been sent into the world, like Mr. Moddle, on a mis-
<br/>sion, has recently taken it into his head to abuse our Journal
<br/>roundly in an eastern paper, on the assumed ground that we
<br/>are opposed to reform. This assumption is mainly based upon
<br/>our remarks upon Miss Fuller’s “Woman in the Nineteenth
<br/>Ceutury.” Our eyes are not shut to the evils of society, nor
<br/>are we by any means indifferent about their existence, for we
<br/>happen to experience personal discomforts every day, which
<br/>are owing to some abuse of law or custom that might better
<br/>be abolished than not; but we have learned to take our daily
<br/>rubs coolly, and we can look upon the sufferings of others
<br/>with quite as much composure as we can endure our own.
<br/>We have but little faith in the plan which our modern reform-
<br/>ers adopt, of scolding the world into good behavior; and we
<br/>have less faith still in the efficacy of societies to reform abuses,
<br/>particularly the abuses of foreign governments. Our reform-
<br/>ers are too apt to forget that "the earth is the Lord’s," and
<br/>trust to Him too little to provide for the happiness of his
<br/>children, trusting loo much to themselves. Every man has
<br/>it in his own power to reform himself, and when he has done
<br/>that well, he is in a capital condition to help reform the
<br/>world, but not before. There are some excellent hints on this
<br/>subject in the Bible, which would do our eastern friend peculiar<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>good, if he were to meditate on them whenever he may feel
<br/>disposed to hurl his arrows at supposed non-reformers, like
<br/>ourselves. We do not believe in the existence of individual or
<br/>isolated vices in a society; it is, therefore, an idle task to at-
<br/>tempt to heal it of any one disorder. The whole system must
<br/>be purged of its evil humors. If we concentrate ail our ener-
<br/>gies in the endeavor to remove a particular evil, all the others
<br/>will grow the more vigorously for being neglected; while we
<br/>are trying to cure the world of gambling, licentiousness and
<br/>avarice and lying and oppression and thievery and drunken-
<br/>ness will grow in strength. The whole body must be phy-
<br/>sicked, and not one of its members, to restore it to health.</p>
         <p>It is unfortunate for those unhappy persons who arrogate
<br/>to themselves the divine title of reformers, that they gener-
<br/>ally forget to reform themselves, and they consequently make
<br/>as ridiculous a figure in the world as the fat man in the mob
<br/>that Dean Swift tells of, who kept complaining of the crowd
<br/>until a by-stander reminded him that it was his own carcass
<br/>that caused all the inconvenience, and that there would be
<br/>room enough if he were only out of the way.</p>
         <p>The true reformers of the world are those who scatter
<br/>truths ; it matters not a straw what they are. Every dis-
<br/>covery in what are called the physical sciences, obliterates
<br/>some moral evil. The man with the most knowledge is the
<br/>greatest reformer, but the converse of this proposition is sup-
<br/>posed to be the case, and the country is overrun with witlings
<br/>who set about reforming society before they have mastered
<br/>their alphabets. In all countries, but in ours above all, the
<br/>intelligence of the people is the law; therefore it is better to
<br/>aim at enlightening the people, than to get up a crusade
<br/>against the law itself. The statute books of England and the
<br/>United States are full of dead laws, strangled by the intelli-
<br/>gence of the people, but not repealed. The law of capital
<br/>punishment is dying daily ; the progress of a certain trial the
<br/>past week, proves that it is almost dead. It is well for a bad
<br/>law to be repealed the moment that its wickedness is felt,
<br/>but the philanthropist need give himself no uneasiness about
<br/>it; let him instruct the people, and the law will die of itself.
<br/>Ignorance is the great father of law, and when the law is in
<br/>advance of the people, they will make laws for themselves,
<br/>like the Lynch-laws of the west. If we take a glance at the
<br/>history of the world, we shall find that all the reformers have
<br/>been poets or the discoverers of truths in science, while pra-
<br/>ters about reform have left the world quite as full of error as
<br/>they found it. Milton’s Comus has doubtless done much
<br/>towards reforming the world, but his Tetrachordon, and other
<br/>tracts, which were intended expressly to reform it, have done
<br/>nothing.</p>
         <p>Our abusive friend is doubtless very sincere in his belief
<br/>that the world is to be reformed by newspaper paragraphs,
<br/>and we wish him nothing worse than that he may live to
  <br/>see his faith verified.</p>

            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>osophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially un-
<br/>deniable. His patés à la fois were beyond doubt immacu-
<br/>late : but what pen can do justice to his essays sur la Nature
<br/>—his thoughts sur I'Ame—his observations sur VEsprit ? If
<br/>his omelettes—if his fricandeaux were inestimable, what lit-
<br/>térateur of that day would not have given twice as much (or
<br/>an “ Idée de Bon-Bon"  as for all the trash of all the “ Idées"
<br/>of all the rest of the savants ? Bon-Bon had ransacked libra-
<br/>ries which no other man had ransacked—had read more than
<br/>any other would have entertained a notion of reading—had
<br/>understood more than any other would have conceived the
<br/>possibility of understanding; and although, while he flour-
<br/>ished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to as-
<br/>sert “ that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the Acade-
<br/>my, nor the depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his
<br/>doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended,
<br/>still it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehen-
<br/>sion. It was, I think, on account of their self-evidency that
<br/>manv persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is to
<br/>Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther —it is to Bon-Bon that
<br/>Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The
<br/>former was indeed not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an
<br/>Aristotelian—nor did he, like the modern Leibnitz, waste
<br/>those precious hours which might be employed in the inven-
<br/>tion of a fricasée, or, facili gradú, the analysis of a sensation,
<br/>in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and wa-
<br/>ters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was Ionic
<br/>—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned à priori—He
<br/>reasoned also à posteriori. His ideas were innate—or
<br/>otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizond—He be-
<br/>lieved in Bossarion. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-
<br/>Bonist.</p>
         <p>I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restau-
<br/>rateur. I would not, however, have any friend of mine im-
<br/>agine that, in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line, our
<br/>hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and impor-
<br/>tance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in which
<br/>branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his
<br/>opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connec-
<br/>tion with the capabilities of the stomach. I am not sure,
<br/>indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the Chinese, who
<br/>hold that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all events
<br/>were right, he thought, who employed the same word for
<br/>the mind and the diaphragm.<span class="anchor" id="a001">
               <a href="3n001"/>
            </span> By this I do not mean to
<br/>insinuate a charge of gluttony, or indeed any other serious
<br/>charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-
<br/>Bon had his failings—and what great man has not a thou-
<br/>sand ?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they were
<br/>failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in
<br/>other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the
<br/>light of virtues. As regards one of these foibles, I should not
<br/>even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarka-
<br/>ble prominency—the extreme alto relievo—in which it jut-
<br/>ted out from the plane of his general disposition.—He could
<br/>never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.</p>
         <p>Not that he was avaricious—no.	It was by no means
<br/>necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bar-
<br/>gain should be to his own proper advantage. Provided a
<br/>trade could be effected—a trade of any kind, upon any terms,
<br/>or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile was seen
<br/>for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a
<br/>knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.</p>
         <p>At any epoch it would not be very wonderful it a humor
<br/>so peculiar as the one I have just mentioned, should elicit
<br/>attention and remark. At the epoch of our narrative, had
<br/>this peculiarity not attracted observation, there would have
<br/>been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,
<br/>upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was
<br/>wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which
<br/>he would laugh at his own jokes, or welcome an acquain-
<br/>tance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature ; stories
<br/>were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented
<br/>of at leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable
<br/>capacities, vague longings, and unnatural inclinations im-
<br/>planted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his
<br/>own.</p>
         <p>The philosopher had other weakneses—but they are scarce-
<br/>ly worthy our serious examination. For example, there are
<br/>few men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting
<br/>in an inclination for the bottle. Whether this inclination be<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof, of such profundi-
<br/>ty, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn,
<br/>did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—
<br/>nor do I. Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly clas-
<br/>sical, it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would
<br/>lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to
<br/>characterise, at one and the same time, his essais and his
<br/>omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had its al-
<br/>lotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the
<br/>Côtes du Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what
<br/>Catullus was to Homer. He would sport with a syllogism
<br/>in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over Clos de
<br/>Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chamberlin.
<br/>Well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had
<br/>attended him in the peddling propensity to which I have
<br/>formerly alluded—but this was by no means the case. In-
<br/>deed, to say the truth, that trait of mind in the philosophic
<br/>Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange
<br/>intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured wilh
<br/>the diablerie of his favorite German studies.</p>
         <p>To enter the little Cafe in the Cul-de-Sac Le Febvre was,
<br/>at the period of our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of
<br/>genius. Bon-Bon was a man of genius. There was not a
<br/>sous-cuisinier in Rouen, who could not have told you that
<br/>Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and
<br/>forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of ge-
<br/>nius. His large water-dog was acquainted with the fact,
<br/>and upon the approach of his master, betrayed his sense of
<br/>inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a debasement of the
<br/>ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether unwor-
<br/>thy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual
<br/>respect might have been attributed to the personal appear-
<br/>ance of the metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I
<br/>am constrained to say, have its weight even with a beast;
<br/>and I am willing to allow much in the outward man of the
<br/>restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the
<br/>quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmos-
<br/>phere of the little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal
<br/>an expression—which mere physical bulk alone will be found
<br/>at all times inefficient in creating. If, however, Bon-Bon
<br/>was barely three feet in height, and if his head was diminu-
<br/>tively small, still it was impossible to behold the rotundity
<br/>of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly border-
<br/>ing upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must
<br/>have seen a type of his acquirements—in its immensity a fit-
<br/>ting habitation for his immortal soul.</p>
         <p>I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter
<br/>of habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external
<br/>metaphysician. I might hint that the hair of our hero was
<br/>worn short, combed smoothly over his forehead, and sur-
<br/>mounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and tassels—
<br/>that his pea-green jerkin was not alter the fashion of those
<br/>worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—
<br/>that the sleeves were something fuller than the reigning cos-
<br/>tume permitted—that the cuffs were turned up, not as usual
<br/>in that barbarous period, with cloth of the same quality and
<br/>color as the garment, but faced in a more fanciful manner
<br/>with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his slippers were
<br/>of a bright purple, curiously filagreed, and might have been
<br/>manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the
<br/>toes, and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—
<br/>that his breeches were of the yellow satin-like material cal-
<br/>led aimable—that his sky-blue cloak, resembling in form a
<br/>dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all over with crimson
<br/>devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of
<br/>the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the re-
<br/>markable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Flor-
<br/>ence, “ that it was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon
<br/>was indeed a bird of Paradise, or the rather a very Paradise
<br/>of perfection."—I might, I say, expatiate upon all these
<br/>points if I pleased ;—but I forbear:—merely personal details
<br/>may be left to historical novelists;—they are beneath the
<br/>moral dignity of matter-of-fact.</p>
         <p>I have said that “ to enter the Café in the Cul-de-Sac Le
<br/>Febvre was to enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but
<br/>then it was only the man of genius who could duly estimate
<br/>the merits of the sanctum. A sign consisting of a vast folio
<br/>swung before the entrance. On one side of the volume was
<br/>painted a bottle; on the reverse a pate. On the back were
<br/>visible in large letters the words Œuvres de Bon-Bon. T bus
<br/>was delicately shadowed forth the two-fold occupation of
<br/>the proprietor.</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page245"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>Upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the
<br/>building presented itself to view. A long, low pitched room
<br/>of antique construction, was indeed all the accommodation af-
<br/>forded by the Càfe. In a corner of the apartment stood the
<br/>bed of the metaphysician. An array of curtains, together with
<br/>a canopy à la Greque, gave it an air at once classic and com-
<br/>fortable. In the corner diagonally opposite, appeared, in di-
<br/>rect family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the
<br/>bibliotheque. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the
<br/>dresser. Here lay an oven-full of the latest ethics—there a
<br/>kettle of duodecimo melanges. Volumes of German morali-
<br/>ty were hand and glove with the gridiron—a toasting fork
<br/>might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato reclined
<br/>at his ease in the frying pan—and contemporary manuscripts
<br/>were filed away upon the spit.</p>
         <p>In other respects the Càfe de Bon-Bon might be said to
<br/>differ little from the usual restaurants of the period. A large
<br/>fire-place yawned opposite the door. On the right of the
<br/>fire-place an open cupboard displayed a formidable array of
<br/>labelled bottles.</p>
         <p>It was here, about twelve o’clock one night, during the
<br/>severe winter of-----, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having lis-
<br/>tened for some time to the comments of his neighbours
<br/>upon his singular propensity—that Pierre Bon-Bon, I say,
<br/>having turned them all out of his house, locked the door up-
<br/>on them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific
<br/>mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a
<br/>fire of blazing faggots.</p>
         <p>It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with
<br/>once or twice during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the
<br/>house tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that,
<br/>rushing through the crannies in the wall, and pouring impet-
<br/>uously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of the
<br/>philosopher’s bed, and disorganised the economy of his pate-
<br/>pane and papers. The huge folio sign that swung without,
<br/>exposed to the fury of the tempest, creaked ominously, and
<br/>gave out a moaning sound from it stanchions of solid oak.</p>
         <p>It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician
<br/>drew up his chair to its customary station by the hearth.
<br/>Many circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred du-
<br/>ring the day, to disturb the serenity of his meditations. In
<br/>attempting des œufs à la Princesse he had unfortunately
<br/>perpetrated an omelete à la Rente ; the discovery of a prin-
<br/>ciple in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a
<br/>stew; and last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of
<br/>those admirable bargains which he at all times took such
<br/>especial delight in bringing to a successful termination. But
<br/>in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissi-
<br/>tudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that
<br/>nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so
<br/>well calculated to produce. Whistling to his more imme-
<br/>diate vicinity the large black water-dog we have spoken of
<br/>before, and settling himself uneasily in his chair, he could
<br/>not help casting a wary and unquiet eye towards those dis-
<br/>tant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows
<br/>not even the red fire-light itself could more than partially
<br/>succeed in overcoming. Having completed a scrutiny whose
<br/>exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself, he drew
<br/>close to his seat a small table covered with books and pa-
<br/>pers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a
<br/>Voluminous manuscript, intended for publication on the mor-
<br/>row.</p>
         <p>He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “ I am
<br/>in no hurry, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whin-
<br/>ing voice in the apartment.</p>
         <p>“The devil!” ejaculated 
<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>our hero, starting to his feet,
<br/>overturning the table at his side, and staring around him in
<br/>astonishment.</p>
         <p>“ Very true,” calmly replied the voice.</p>
         <p>“ Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here ?"
<br/>vociferated the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something
<br/>which lay stretched at full length upon the bed.</p>
         <p>"I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to
<br/>the interrogatories, “ I was saying that I am not at all push-
<br/>ed for lime—that the business upon which I took the liber-
<br/>ty of calling is of no pressing importance—in short that I
<br/>can very well wait until you have finished your Exposition.</p>
         <p>“ My Exposition !—there now !—how do you know-how
<br/>came you to understand that I was writing an exposition ?
<br/>good God!"</p>
         <p>“ Hush !" replied the figure in a shrill under tone: and,
<br/>arising quickly from the bed, he made a single step towards<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>our hero, while an iron lamp that depended overhead swung
<br/>convulsively back from his approach.	</p>
         <p>The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow
<br/>scrutiny of the stranger’s dress and appearance. The out-
<br/>lines of a figure, exceedingly lean, but much above the com-
<br/>mon height, were rendered minutely distinct by means of a
<br/>faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin, but
<br/>was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago.
<br/>These garments had evidently been intended for a much
<br/>shorter person than their present owner. His ankles and
<br/>wrists were left naked for several inches. In his shoes,
<br/>however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the
<br/>extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress.
<br/>His bead was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of
<br/>the hinder part, from which depended a queue of considerable
<br/>length. A pair of green spectacles, with side glasses, pro-
<br/>tected his eyes from the influence of the light, and at the
<br/>same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their
<br/>color or their conformation. About the entire person there
<br/>was no evidence of a shirt; but a white cravat, of filthy ap-
<br/>pearance, was tied with extreme precision around the throat,
<br/>and the ends, hanging down formally side by side, gave (al-
<br/>though I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an ecclesiastic.
<br/>Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and de-
<br/>meanour might have very well sustained a conception of that
<br/>nature. Over his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a
<br/>modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of the an-
<br/>cients. In a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously
<br/>a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel. This
<br/>book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly
<br/>from the person as to discover the words “ Rituel Catholique”
<br/>in white letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was
<br/>interestingly saturnine—even cadaverously pale. The fore-
<br/>head was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the ridges of con-
<br/>templation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down
<br/>into an expression of the most submissive humility. There
<br/>was also a clasping of the hands, as he stepped towards our
<br/>hero—a deep sigh—and altogether a look of such utter sanc-
<br/>tity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposses-
<br/>sing. Every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of
<br/>the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory sur-
<br/>vey of his visiter’s person, he shook him cordially by the
<br/>hand, and conducted him to a seat.</p>
         <p>There would however be a radical error in attributing this
<br/>instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any
<br/>one of those causes which might naturally be supposed to
<br/>have had an influence. Indeed Pierre Bon-Bon, from what I
<br/>have been able to understand of his disposition, was of all
<br/>men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness
<br/>of exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate
<br/>an observer of men and things should have failed to discover,
<br/>upon the moment, the real character of the personage who
<br/>had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To say no more, the
<br/>conformation of his visiter’s feet was sufficiently remarkable
<br/>—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall</p>
         <p>hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part</p>
         <p>of his breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a pal-
<br/>pable fact. Judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our
<br/>hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a
<br/>person for whom he had at all times entertained the most
<br/>unqualified respect. He was, however, too much of the di-
<br/>plomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions
<br/>in regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to
<br/>appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpect-
<br/>edly enjoyed, but by leading his guest into conversation, to
<br/>elicit some important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining
<br/>a place in his contemplated publication, enlighten the human
<br/>race and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas which,
  <br/>I should have added, his visiter’s great age, and well known
<br/>proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have
<br/>enabled him to afford.</p>
         <p>Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the
<br/>gentleman sit down, while he himself took occasion to throw
<br/>some faggots upon the fire, and place upon the now re-estab-
<br/>lished table some bottles of Mousseux. Having quickly com-
<br/>pleted these operations, he drew his chair vis-à-vis to his
<br/>companion’s and waited until the latter should open the con-
<br/>versation. But plans even the most skillfully matured are 
      <br/>often thwarted in the outset of they application, and the
<br/>restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words
<br/>of his visiter's speech.</p>
         <p>"I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he: “ha! ha!ha!—
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page246"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>he! he! he !—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho ! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and
<br/>the devil, dropping at once the sanctity of his demeanour,
<br/>opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear to ear, so as to
<br/>display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth, and throwing back
<br/>his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and uproariously,
<br/>while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,
<br/>joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a
<br/>tangent, stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner
<br/>of the apartment.</p>
         <p>Not so the philosopher ; he was too much a man of the
<br/>world either to laugh like the dog, or by shrieks to betray
<br/>the indecorous trepidation of the cat. It must be confessed,
<br/>he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which
<br/>formed the words “ Rituel Catholique" on the book in his
<br/>guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their
<br/>import, and in a few seconds, in place of the original title,
<br/>the words Régitre des Condamnés blaze forth in characters
<br/>of red. This startling circumstance, when Bon-Bon replied
<br/>to his visiter’s remark, imparted to his manner an air of em-
<br/>barrassment which probably might not otherwise have been
<br/>observed.</p>
         <p>“Why, sir.” said the philosopher, “why, sir, to speak
<br/>sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the d----dest
<br/>—that is to say I think—I imagine—I have some faint—
<br/>some very faint idea—of the remarkable honor------”</p>
         <p>“ Oh !—ah!—yes!—very well !” interrupted his Majesty,
<br/>"say no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off
<br/>his green spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the
<br/>sleeve of his coat, and deposited them in his pocket.</p>
         <p>If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book,
<br/>his amazement was now much increased by the spectacle
<br/>which here presented itself to view. In raising his eves,
<br/>with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his
<br/>guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he bad antici-
<br/>pated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet ha-
<br/>zel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor
<br/>white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above,
<br/>or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In
<br/>short Pierre Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty
<br/>had no eyes whatsoever, but could discover no indications of
<br/>their having existed at any previous period ; for the space
<br/>where eyes should naturally have been, was, I am constrained
<br/>to say, simply a dead level of flesh.</p>
         <p>It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear
<br/>making some inquiry into the sources of so strange a pheno-
<br/>menon, and the reply of his Majesty was at once prompt, dig-
<br/>nified, and satisfactory.</p>
         <p>“ Eyes ! my dear Bon-Bon, eyes! did you say ?—oh ! ah !
<br/>I perceive. The ridiculous prints, eh ? which are in circu-
<br/>lation, have given you a false idea of my personal appearance.
<br/>Eyes !!—true. Eyes, Pierre Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is the head?—right—the
<br/>ead of a worm. To you likewise these optics are indis-
<br/>pensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is more
<br/>penetrating than your own. There is a cat, I see in the
<br/>corner—a pretty cat!—look at her !—observe her well!
<br/>Now, Bon-Bon, do you behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I
<br/>say—the ideas—the reflections—which are being engender-
<br/>ed in her pericranium ? There it is now !—you do not. She
<br/>is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundi-
<br/>ty of her mind. She has just concluded that 1 am the most
<br/>distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most su-
<br/>perfluous of metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not alto-
<br/>gether blind : but to one of my profession the eyes you speak
<br/>of would be merely an incumbrance, liable at any time to
<br/>be put out by a toasting iron ora pitchfork. To you, I allow,
<br/>these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon,
<br/>to use them well;—my vision is the soul.”</p>
         <p>Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the
<br/>table, and pouring out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him
<br/>to drink it without scruple, and make himself perfectly at
<br/>home.</p>
         <p>“ A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Ma-
<br/>jesty, tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the
<br/>latter put down his glass after a thorough compliance with
<br/>his visiter’s injunction. " A clever book that of yours, upon
<br/>my honor. It's a work after my own heart. Your arrange-
<br/>ment of matter, I think, however, might be improved, and
<br/>many of your notions remind me of Aristotle. That philo-
<br/>sopher was one of my most intimate acquaintances. I liked
<br/>him as much for his terrible ill temper, as for his happy
<br/>knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth in<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out
<br/>of pure compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-
<br/>Bon, you very well know to what divine moral truth I am
<br/>alluding.”</p>
         <p>“ Cannot say that I-------”</p>
         <p>“ Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneez-
<br/>ing men expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”</p>
         <p>“Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the
<br/>metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another
<br/>bumper of Mousseux, and offered his snuff-box to the fingers
<br/>of his visiter.”</p>
         <p>“ There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly
<br/>declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied, “ there
<br/>was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection
<br/>of a friend. You knew, Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah! no, I beg a
<br/>thousand pardons. He met me at Athens, one day, in the
<br/>Parthenon, and told me he was distressed for an idea. I bade
<br/>him write down that ο νους εςτιν αυλος. He said that he
<br/>would do so, and went home, while I stepped over to the
<br/>pyramids. But my conscience smote me for having uttered a
<br/>truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to Athens, I
<br/>arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing the
<br/>‘αυλος.’ Giving the lamma a fillip with my finger I turned it
<br/>upside down. So the sentence now reads ‘ ο νους εςτιν αυγος,'
<br/>and is, you perceive, the fundamental doctrine in his meta-
<br/>physics.”</p>
         <p>“ Were you ever at Rome ?” asked the restaurateur as he
<br/>finished his second bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the
<br/>closet a larger supply of Chambertin.</p>
         <p>“ But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a
<br/>time”—said the devil, as if reciting some passage from a
<br/>book—“ there was a time when occurred an anarchy of five
<br/>years, during which the republic, bereft of all its officers,
<br/>had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people, and
<br/>these were not legally vested with any degree of executive</p>
         <p>power—at that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only
<br/>I was in Rome, and I have no earthly acquaintance, conse-
<br/>quently, with any of its philosophy.”<span class="anchor" id="a002">
               <a href="#n002"/>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>
            <br/>“ What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup !
<br/>—Epicurus ?”</p>
         <p>“ What do I think of whom?"  said the devil in astonish-
<br/>ment, “you cannot surely mean to find any fault with Epicu-
<br/>rus ! What do I think of Epicurus ! Do you mean me, sir ?
<br/>—I am Epicurus. I am the same philosopher who wrote
<br/>each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Dioge-
<br/>nes Laertes.”</p>
         <p>“That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had
<br/>gotten a little into his head.</p>
         <p>“ Very well!—very well, sir!—very well indeed, sir,” said
<br/>his Majesty, apparently much flattered.</p>
         <p>“ That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur dogmatically,
<br/>“ that’s a—hiccup !—a lie!”</p>
         <p>“Well, well! have it your own way,” said the devil
<br/>pacifically: and Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at an
<br/>argument, thought it his duty to conclude a second bottle of
<br/>Chambertin.</p>
         <p>“As I was saying,” resumed the visiter, “as I was obser-
<br/>ving a little while ago, there are some very outre notions in
<br/>that book of yours, Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance,
<br/>do you mean by all that humbug about the soul ? Pray, sir,
<br/>what is the soul ?”</p>
         <p>“The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the mataphysician,refer-
<br/>ring to his MS., “ is undoubtedly”—</p>
         <p>“ No, sir!”</p>
         <p>“ Indubitably”—</p>
         <p>“ No, sir!”</p>
         <p>“ Indisputably”—</p>
         <p>“ No, sir!"</p>
         <p>“ Evidently"—</p>
         <p>“ No, sir!”</p>
         <p>“ Incontrovertibly”—</p>
         <p>“ No sir!"</p>
         <p>“ Hiccup !”—</p>
         <p>“ No, sir!”</p>
         <p>“ And beyond all question a”—</p>
         <p>“No, sir! the soul is no such thing.” (Here, the philosopher
<br/>looking daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the
<br/>spot, of his third bottle of Chambertin.)</p>
         <p>“ Then —hic-cup !—pray, sir—what—what is it ?"</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page247"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>“ That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” re-
<br/>plied his Majesty, musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say,
<br/>I have known some very had souls, and some too—pretty
<br/>good ones.” Here he smacked his lips, and, having uncon-
<br/>sciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket, was
<br/>seized with a violent fit of sneezing.</p>
         <p>He continued :</p>
         <p>“ There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristopha-
<br/>nes—racy : Plato—exquisite—not your Plato, but Plato the
<br/>comic poet; your Plato would have turned the stomach of
<br/>Cerberus—faugh ! Then let me see ! there were Nœvius,
<br/>and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then there
<br/>were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintius Flaccus,
<br/>—dear Quinty ! as I called him when he sung a seculare for
<br/>my amusement, while I toasted him, in pure good humor, on
<br/>a fork. But they want flavor these Romans. One fat Greek
<br/>is worth a dozen of them, and besides will keep, which cannot
<br/>be said of a Quirite.—Let us taste your Sauterne.”</p>
         <p>Bon-Bon bad by this time made up his mind to the nil ad-
<br/>mirari, and endeavored to hand down the bottles in question.
<br/>He was, however, conscious of a strange sound in the room
<br/>like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although extremely in-
<br/>decent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—sim-
<br/>ply kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The
<br/>visiter continued :</p>
         <p>“ I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle ;—
<br/>you know I am fond of variety. Terentius I could not have
<br/>told from Menander. Naso, to my astonishment, was Nican-
<br/>der in disguise. Virgilius bad a strong twang of Theocritus.
<br/>Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus
<br/>Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”</p>
         <p>“ Hic-cup !” here replied Bon-Bon, and his Majesty pro-
<br/>ceeded :</p>
         <p>“ But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a
<br/>penchant, it is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, 6ir, it
<br/>is not every dev—I mean it is not every gentleman who
<br/>knows how to choose a philosopher. Long ones are not
<br/>good ; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a
<br/>little rancid on account of the gall."</p>
         <p>“ Shelled!!”</p>
         <p>“ I mean taken out of the carcass.”</p>
         <p>“ What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician ?’’</p>
         <p>“ Don't mention them !—ugh ! ugh !” (Here his Majesty
<br/>retched violently.) “ I never tasted but one—that rascal
<br/>Hippocrates!—smelt of asafœtida—ugh ! ugh ! ugh !—caught
<br/>a wretched cold washing him in the Styx—and after all he
<br/>gave me the cholera morbus.”</p>
         <p>“The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “ the—
<br/>hic-cup !—abortion of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher drop-
<br/>ped a tear.</p>
         <p>“ After all,” continued the visiter, “ after all, if a dev—if
<br/>a gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than
<br/>one or two; and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplo-
<br/>macy.”</p>
         <p>" How so?”</p>
         <p>“ Why we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provi-
<br/>sions. You must know that, in a climate so sultry as mine,
<br/>it is frequently impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than
<br/>two or three hours ; and after death, unless pickled immedi-
<br/>ately, (and a pickled spirit is not good,) they will—smell—
<br/>you understand, eh ? Putrefaction is always to be appre-
<br/>hended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual
<br/>way.”</p>
         <p>“ Hiccup!—hiccup !—good God ! how do you manage ?”
<br/>Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled
<br/>violence, and the devil half started from his seat;—however,
<br/>with a slight sigh, he recovered his composure, merely say-
<br/>rag to our hero in a low tone, “ I tell you what, Pierre Bon-
<br/>Bon, we must have no more swearing.”</p>
         <p>The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting
<br/>thorough comprehension and acquiescence, and the visiter
<br/>continued:</p>
         <p>“ Why there are several ways of managing. The most of
<br/>us starve: some put up with the pickle: for my part I pur-
<br/>chase my spirits vivente corpore, in which case I find they
<br/>keep very well."</p>
         <p>“ But the body !—hiccup!—the body!!!”</p>
         <p>“ The body, the body—well, what of the body ?—oh! ah !
<br/>I perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the
<br/>transaction. I have made innumerable purchases of the kind
<br/>in my day, and the parties never experienced any inconve-
<br/>nience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and Nero, and Cali-
<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>gula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a thousand
<br/>others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during
<br/>the latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned so-
<br/>ciety. Why isn’t there A-----, now, whom you know as</p>
         <p>well as I ? Is he not in possession of all his faculties, men-
<br/>tal and corporeal ? Who writes a keener epigram ? Who
<br/>reasons more wittily ? Who——but, stay ! I have his agree-
<br/>ment in my pocket-book.”</p>
         <p>Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took
<br/>from it a number of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon
<br/>caught a glimpse of the letters Machi—Maza—Robesp—with
<br/>the words Caligula, George, Elizabeth. His Majesty select-
<br/>ed a narrow slip of parchment, and from it read aloud the
<br/>following words:</p>
         <p>“ In consideration of certain mental endowments which it
<br/>is unnecessary to specify, and in farther consideration of one
<br/>thousand louis d’or, I, being aged one year and one month,
<br/>do hereby make over to the bearer of this agreement all my
<br/>right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my soul.(
<br/>Signed) A.....<span class="anchor" id="a003">
               <a href="#n003"/>
            </span> (Here his Majesty repeated a name
<br/>which I do not feel myself justified in indicating more une-
<br/>quivocally.)</p>
         <p>“A clever fellow that,’’ resumed he; ‘‘but like you, Mon-
<br/>sieur Bon-Bon, he was mistaken about tbe soul. The soul
<br/>a shadow truly ! The soul a shadow ! Ha ! ha ! ha !—he !
<br/>he! he!—hu! hu ! hu! Only think of a fricasséed shadow!”</p>
         <p>“ Only think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow !" exclaim-
<br/>ed our hero, whose faculties were becoming much illumina-
<br/>ted by the profundity of his Majesty’s discourse.</p>
         <p>“ Only think of a—hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now,
<br/>damme!—hiccup!—humph ! If I would have been such a
<br/>—hiccup !—nincompoop. My soul, Mr.—humph !”</p>
         <p>“ Your soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon ?”</p>
         <p>“ Yes, sir—hiccup !—my soul is”—</p>
         <p>“What, sir ?”</p>
         <p>“ No shadow, damme!”</p>
         <p>“ Did not mean to say”—</p>
         <p>“ Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”</p>
         <p>“ Did not intend to assert”—</p>
         <p>“ My soul is—hiccup !—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!
<br/>—a”—</p>
         <p>“What, sir?”</p>
         <p>“Stew.”</p>
         <p>“ Ha!”</p>
         <p>“ Soufflée.”</p>
         <p>“Eh?”</p>
         <p>“ Fricassée.”</p>
         <p>“ Indeed!”</p>
         <p>“Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow !
<br/>I’ll let you have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philo-
<br/>sopher slapped his Majesty upon the back.</p>
         <p>“ Could’nt think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly,
<br/>at the same time rising from his seat. The metaphysician
<br/>stared.</p>
         <p>“ Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.</p>
         <p>“Hiccup!—e-h ?” said the philosopher.</p>
         <p>"Have no funds on hand.”</p>
         <p>“ What ?”</p>
         <p>“ Besides, very unhandsome in me’’—</p>
         <p>“Sir!”</p>
         <p>“ To take advantage of”—</p>
         <p>“Hiccup!”	</p>
         <p>“ Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”</p>
         <p>Here the visiter bowed and withdrew—in what manner
<br/>could not precisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted
<br/>effort to discharge a bottle at “ the villain,” the slender chain
<br/>was severed that depended from the ceiling, and the meta-
<br/>physician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp. </p>

            <div class="lg">
               <br/>Stern in the white man’s council hall,
<br/>’Mid his red brethren of the wood,
<br/>While fearless flashed his eye on all,
<br/>The chieftain Osceola stood—
<br/>And fast the words that keenly stung,
<br/>Like arrows hurtled from his tongue.
<br/>“ Brothers !” he said, “ and ye are come
<br/>To sign the white man’s treaty here,—
<br/>To yield to him our forest home,
<br/>And he will give us lands and deer
<br/>Beyond the western prairie flowers,
<br/>For these broad hunting grounds of ours.
<br/>“ The pale-face is a singing bird!
<br/>Hungry and crafty as the kite—
<br/>And ye his cunning song have heard
<br/>Till like his cheek your hearts are white!
<br/>Till for his fire-drink and his gold
<br/>Your fathers’ bones their sons have sold !
<br/>“ And ye, the strong and pale of face,
<br/>Have bought the Indian’s hunting ground—
<br/>Bought his time-honored burial place,
<br/>With little gold and many a wound—
<br/>Yea—bought his right with hand of mail!
<br/>And with your blood-hounds on the trail,
<br/>You drive him from the everglades,
<br/>Beyond the Mississippi’s flow,
<br/>And with your rifles and your blades
<br/>You hunt him like the buffalo—
<br/>Till turns he, goaded, maddened, back,
<br/>To strike the foe upon the track!
<br/>"Let the white chieftains pause, and hear
<br/>The answer of the Seminole:—
<br/>The red man is a foe to fear—
<br/>He will not sign yon faithless scroll,
<br/>Nor yield to you the lands ye prize—
<br/>The war-belt on your pathway lies !”
<br/>Leapt from his wampum belt the glaive,
<br/>As from the bent bow leaps the shaft,
<br/>And fierce the tempered steel he drave
<br/>Through board and parchment, to the haft;
<br/>"And thus,” he said, with eye of flame—
<br/>" Thus Osceola signs your claim!"

<br/>Tokens of Almighty grace.

<br/>First shall open to the day,

<br/>God’s forgiveness and his smiles.
<br/>Lo ! across thy path of life
<br/>Death’s white shadow’s stealing now;
<br/>Let me not behold the strife—
<br/>Let me still in meekness bow.
<br/>God be with thee, gentle spirit,
<br/>When his angel fondly calls—
<br/>Yielding life, thou wilt inherit
<br/>Life within our Father’s halls.

No. 1.
PAUL DE LA ROCHE.</div>
         <p>[We have condensed the following biographical sketch of the great
<br/>French painter from an article in the London Art-Union. We shall
<br/>give sketches and portraits of other eminent artists hereafter.]</p>
         <p>Paul Delaroche was born in Paris, in 1797. His father
<br/>was a man of taste, and was appointed to value the works
<br/>of Art which were offered at the Mont-de-Piété. He encour-
<br/>aged in his two sons an inclination for the purest Art; and
<br/>the elder, M. Jules Delaroche, after having made con-
<br/>siderable progress as a painter of history, renounced the pro-
<br/>fession, and succeeded to the appointment which his father
<br/>held, and has risen to the directorship of the Mont-de-Piété.
<br/>The younger persevered in his studies, and has, by his assid-<div class="pagebreak" id="#page249"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>uity, attained to the first rank among the painters of the
<br/>French school.</p>
         <p>Paul Delaroche devoted himself first to landscape painting;
<br/>he then entered the atelier of Gros, under whom he applied
<br/>himself to the human figure, and soon became distinguished
<br/>by the rapid progress he made. Under Gros the young De-
<br/>laroche also soon declared his dissent from what is termed
<br/>the hitherto prevalent “ classicism” of the French school,
<br/>which was then yielding to the Renaissance; but took up a
<br/>position between the classic and the romantic, and labored
<br/>to create a style in harmony with the temper and habits of
<br/>his time. He commenced, notwithstanding, in that mystico-
<br/>biblical style which flourished a few years under the restora-
<br/>tion, and which has even of late shown symptoms of revi-
<br/>val ; but he soon discovered that this style did not suit him.
<br/>His first picture, 'Naphthali in the Desert,’ which he pain-
<br/>ted at the age of twenty-two, was exhibited in the year
<br/>1819, but it attracted no attention; another, the subject of
<br/>which was ‘ Joas Rescued by Josabeth,’ was more fortunate.
<br/>This was exhibited in 1822,' and sufficiently indicated those
<br/>powers which M. Delaroche subsequently developed and so
<br/>judiciously tempered. In a compte-rendu of the Salon of
<br/>1822, by M. Thiers, this picture is spoken of in terms highly
<br/>complimentary to the young artist. In 1824 he produced
<br/>three pictures, which won for him a gold medal. The first
<br/>represented 'Vincent de Paul Preaching in the Presence of
<br/>the Court of Louis XII.;’ the second, ‘ Joan of Arc Examin-
<br/>ed in Prison by the Cardinal of Winchester;' the third,' Saint Sebastian.’</p>
         <p>In 1827 ‘ The Capture of the Trocadero’ appeared, a work
<br/>which had been commissioned by the Government, and for
<br/>which he received the cross of the Legion of Honor. About
<br/>the same period he exhibited other works, which have con-
<br/>tributed much to his fame. The most celebrated of these
<br/>are, ‘ The Death of Agostino Carracci;' 'Flora Macdonald
<br/>Succouring the Pretender after the Battle of Culloden ;’ ‘ The
<br/>Death of Queen Elizabeth,’ which hangs on the walls of the
<br/>Luxembourg; ‘An Episode of the St. Bartholomew;’ ‘The
<br/>Death of the President Duranti;’ a full-length portrait of the
<br/>Dauphin, as a model, to be worked in Gobelin tapestry;
<br/>and the ceiling of the Museum of Charles X.</p>
         <p>During some years after this period M. Delaroche painted
<br/>only what the French call moyen-age subjects, although
<br/>the term is scarcely suitable, as comprehending even those
<br/>that come within a century or two of our own time. In
<br/>1831 he produced ‘ The Children of Edward,’ which has
<br/>been so often engraved and lithographed, and which induced
<br/>M. Delavigne to compose his tragedy on the same subject.
<br/>Another highly successful picture was ‘Richelieu, on the
<br/>Rhone, with Cinq-Mars and de Thou;' as also that repre-
<br/>senting Cardinal Mazarin presiding, while even dying, at
<br/>a game of lansquenet. In 1832 M. Delaroche was called to
<br/>the Institute; and in the same year he exhibited, perhaps,
<br/>the most impressive of all his works, ‘ Cromwell Contem-
<br/>plating the remains of Charles I.,’ a composition which,
<br/>once seen, either in the original or in engraving, can never
<br/>be forgotten. The extensive popularity of this production
<br/>testifies its perfect success, and affords another extraordinary
<br/>example of the valuable simplicity with which this artist
<br/>can invest subjects, which in other hands would have been
<br/>at least repulsive and, perhaps, atrocious. In 1834 appeared
<br/>‘ The Execution of Lady Jane Gray ;’ which during the en-
<br/>tire period of its exhibition was, early and late, surrounded
<br/>by a crowd of admiring spectators. On the same occasion
<br/>were exhibited two other works, ‘ Galileo Studying in his
<br/>Cabinet ;’ and a Saint Amelia, intended as a model for the
<br/>painting of the great window of the chapel at the Chateau
<br/>d’Eu.</p>
         <p>In 1835 M. Delaroche exhibited his picture of 'The Death
<br/>of the Duke of Guise;’ it is much smaller than his other cele-
<br/>brated works, and was the only one exhibited in 1835. The
<br/>murder of the Duke of Guise, it will be remembered, was
<br/>effected in the Castle of Blois, by order of Henry III. The
<br/>moment chosen is that when the King throws aside the
<br/>arras from before the doorway, and, in his impatience to
<br/>learn the result, asks in an agitated manner “ if all is done;"
<br/>he then discovers the body of the Duke, lying near the bed ;
<br/>and the murderers are relating to him the manner of his
<br/>death. This picture was purchased by the Duke of Orleans,
<br/>it displays more care and finish than any which preceded it.
<br/>The intention of the painter is shown in the figure of the
<br/>King, who looks from the corner of his eye to ascertain if his<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>enemy be really dead: it is also apparent in the courtesy
<br/>with which he is received by the assassins, who separate
<br/>that he may see that his commands have been accomplished. 
<br/>It is in the body of the Duke that the artist recovers his grave
<br/>dignity: he has never produced anything more forcible than
<br/>this. In the meantime he exhibited his well-known pictures,
<br/>‘ Charles I. in the Guard-Room,’ and ‘ Lord Strafford.’
<br/>From 1837 to 1841 M. Delaroche was almost entirely occu-
<br/>pied by his great work at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, having
<br/>exhibited only two pictures, the one a fine portrait of ‘Na-
<br/>poleon in his Cabinet at the Tuileries.’</p>
         <p>In 1835 it was proposed to M. Delaroche to enrich the
<br/>walls of the Madeline with suitable compositions ; but cir-
<br/>cumstances subsequently led to his resignation of the task.
<br/> In the same year he proceeded to Italy, where he formed a
<br/>matrimonial alliance with the only daughter of Horace Ver-
<br/>net, who was then director of the French Academy at Rome.
<br/>M. Delaroche was amply compensated for his disappoint-
<br/>ment, with respect to the Madeline, by having confided to
<br/>him the adornment of the Amphitheatre of the Ecole des
<br/>Beaux Arts—a task to which he devoted three years of as-
<br/>siduous labor.</p>
         <p>The distinguished artist has recently returned from a sec-
<br/>ond visit to Rome, where he has executed a portrait of the
<br/>Pope ; which, in Italy, has received the most unqualified
<br/>praise. M. Delaroche has painted but very few portraits in
<br/>addition to those already mentioned. He has produced a
<br/>portrait of the Countess Rossi (late Madlle. Sontag), and
<br/>some others, in oil, crayon, &amp;c.; all of which exhibit, in a
<br/>high degree, the striking characteristics of the accomplished
<br/>master, who could not devote to portraiture a genius which
<br/>has urged him onward to a series of triumphs in historical
<br/>and didactic art.</p>
         <p>Few artists of any time, even since the revival of paint-
<br/>ing, can be pointed out as having passed during any given
<br/>portion of their lives a career so honorable and profitable as
<br/>that hitherto enjoyed by M. Delaroche. At a very early age
<br/>he was already in the arena competing for the suffrages of
<br/>the public; and in the term of twenty years he produced
<br/>thirty pictures, all of which have been signally distinguished
<br/>by the plaudits of the public, and many of which will re-
<br/>main among the remarkable examples of the French School
<br/>of Art. All his works have been popularised by the most
<br/>skilful engravers; from a very early period he received the
<br/>most flattering distinctions, and has in private life enjoyed
<br/>all the felicities attendant on a position so honorable. At
<br/>present, M. Delaroche is again busied in his studio, with a
<br/>prospective yet more brilliant than the past, and which it is
<br/>our sincere and reasonable hope he may live most fully to re-
<br/>alize.</p>
         <p>As a teacher, Delaroche has formed a long train of pupils,
<br/>who speak of him with sincere respect. In stature he
<br/>reaches the middle height, being apparently of a slight but
<br/>active frame; with a head of fine character, an eye of intel-
<br/>ligence, and very searching in its gaze.</p>
         <p>In his private character Delaroche presents much for es-
<br/>.teem. Independent of the excellence of his qualities in do-
<br/>mestic life, he wears no conscious air of superiority; is free,
<br/>frank, and affable in his manners; liberal in exposing the
<br/>riches of his studio; and communicative in reference to any
<br/>methods of his painting which the stranger may think wor-
<br/>thy of enquiry. Offered by the government a large pecuni-
<br/>ary present on the completion of the Hemicycle, he waived
<br/>it for himself, on condition that it should be offered to in-
<br/>crease the excellence of the engraving which, under sanction
<br/>of the Government, is about to be published.</p>
         <p>We never encountered one who so completely realized our
<br/>notions of high genius : his eloquent countenance, so full of
<br/>rapid thought and expression—his exceeding, and somewhat
<br/>restless, energy of manner—conveyed to our minds the only
<br/>just idea we ever received of what we understand, or desire
<br/>to understand, by the term soul—as characteristic of a na-
<br/>ture far superior to the great mass of humankind. The feel-
<br/>ine of respect, not unmingled with affection, with which we
<br/>regard the great painter of France, is enhanced by the know-
<br/>ledge that his high position is sustained not alone by that in-
<br/>tellectual power which commands reverence from all, but
<br/>by the continual exercise of the more “ private and personal</p>
         <p>virtues"—the perpetual manifestation of a generosity truly</p>
         <p>catholic—and the almost daily proof supplied by his life,
<br/>that true greatness may exist without a particle of selfish,
<br/>ness, vanity, or envy.</p>

         <div class="head">THE AMERICAN AUTHORS’ UNION.</div>
         <p>“ Deccus,” said the reviewer of that gentleman’s works, as
<br/>he opened his manuscript, “as you are well aware, gentlemen,
<br/>is one of our most original, most promising, and most indige-
<br/>nous authors, he is, in fact the American Boz; I have written
<br/>my review of his writings, not from any personal regard, not
<br/>from any wish to display my own learning, but from a sin-
<br/>cere desire to promote the interests of American literature.
<br/>I shall begin with an analysis of his greatest work, the
<br/>Cogitations of Christopher Cockroach, citizen. Deccus is a—”</p>
         <p>“ Really, gentlemen,”said Mr. Deccus, rising with a flush-
<br/>ed face, “it strikes me that it is taking a liberty with an au-
<br/>thor’s works which I, in the name of American literature,
<br/>must protest against, to name any one of his writings as the
<br/>greatest. I name no names gentlemen, I designate no pre-
<br/>sumptuous individual, but the man who takes that liberty
<br/>with my productions can never be classed among the friends
<br/>of American literature. I am an injured man, gentlemen.
<br/>I accuse no one, I name no one, but a certain individual has
<br/>done me an immense injury. If one of my works can be
<br/>classed as the greatest of my productions, perhaps, gentlemen,
<br/>some of my works will be called the smallest. Beware, gen-
<br/>tlemen, how you trifle with the interests of American litera-
<br/>ture, that delicate plant which requires the warm sunlight
<br/>of your favor, but which the cold, the chilly, the withering
<br/>blasts of criticism may uproot and destroy and eradicate for-
<br/>ever.”</p>
         <p>This speech of the injured author so disconcerted the re-
<br/>viewer, that he put his manuscript in his pocket, and sat
<br/>down without opening his lips. But his silence seemed to
<br/>say, that as for satisfying an author by reviewing his book, the
<br/>thing is clearly impossible. I will make the attempt no
<br/>more.</p>
         <p>Cries were now made for the letter of Areanus, which be-
<br/>ing produced, was found to contain a tragedy in six acts, by
<br/>Major Laurel, the American Sheridan Knowles. It was
<br/>read by Ostensible Watkins, Esq., the American John Phi-
<br/>lip Kemble, a remarkable elocutionist, who pronounced the
<br/>title, sufficiently moving in itself, in a manner that sent a
<br/>thrill of horror through all the several authors present.</p>

      <div>
         <div class="head">The Author's Tragedy
OR
THE PERFIDIOUS PUBLISHER.
A Drama in Six Acts.</div>
ACT I.
<p>Scene—A room with no furniture, except a weeping wife and two
crying children. Enter</p>
         <p>Writefort, an American author, with a large roll of paper under
<br/>his arm. He looks with unspeakable anguish on his wife and children,
<br/>strikes his forehead, turns both of his pockets inside out, points to his
<br/>manuscript, and rushes off the stage.</p>
  ACT II.
<p>Scene—A counting room, clerke writing at a desk, a publisher with
<br/>spectacles, sitting in an easy chair reading a newspaper. Enter ano-
<br/>their publisher, sleek, smiling, well fed, and well dressed.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. Brother, good morning.</p>
         <p>2d Pub. Good morning, brother.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. Have you read the last manuscript, my brother ?</p>
         <p>2d Pub. Ha, ha, ha, capital! read it, indeed? What
<br/>innocent fools these authors are, to think we read their
<br/>manuscripts.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. I am astonished at your trifling talk upon a seri-
<br/>ous subject; you know I always reed all manuscripts that
<br/>come to hand; I stick a reed in them, so I can always say
<br/>with a clear conscience, (for you know I hate lying,) Sir, I
<br/>have been reeding your manuscript, when an author applies
<br/>to me.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>2d Pub. You were born a wag, brother; but what will
<br/>you say to Mr. Writefort? He will call this morning for an
<br/>answer.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. It’s fortunate that you reminded me of him: I’ll
<br/>do it now. Porter, bring in that last nuisance. [The porter
<br/>brings in a roll of manuscripts. The 1st publisher shoves a
<br/>reed through it, and laughs.'] There, I am ready for him;
<br/>and here he comes.</p>
         <p>Enter Writefort, an American Author. He takes off his hat and bows
<br/>respectfully.</p>
         <p>Author. Have you examined my work, sir ?</p>
         <p>1st Pub. [Winks to his brother.] I have this moment
<br/>done reeding it.</p>
         <p>Auth. Good Heavens ! You have read it! Little did I
<br/>expect this. Sir, accept the thanks of a grateful author. I
<br/>cannot doubt, then, that you will buy it. It cost me many
<br/>years of painful study, many privations, many fears, and many
<br/>hopes. I am partial, I know, but still, I know the work has
<br/>merit.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. [Aside to his brother.] I’ll have a bit of fun. [To
<br/>the author.] Merit? Of course. In the whole course of my
<br/>reading I never encountered greater—greenness. (aside.)</p>
         <p>Auth. Oh, sir, what would my poor wife say, if she were
<br/>to hear that. Will you, sir, allow me to repeat it to her ?</p>
         <p>1st Pub. Of course. Pray, Mr. Writefort, what value do
<br/>you put upon your work?</p>
         <p>Author. Indeed, Sir, I am afraid to say. No price would
<br/>seem too large to me who know its value, and none too
<br/>small to meet my wants.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. Would you refuse ten thousand dollars?</p>
         <p>Author. Ten thousand dollars ! Surely. Sir, you are jest-
<br/>ing or I am dreaming. Did you mean what you said ; did you
<br/>say ten thousand dollars ?</p>
         <p>1st Pub. I did.</p>
         <p>u thor. Sir, I will take less, I will take nine thousand
<br/>five hundred. Excuse my trembling, Sir, but your offer was
<br/>so unexpected, it has quite unnerved me. I must go home
<br/>and tell my wife. I will return again to-morrow and close
<br/>the bargain. [He shakes both Publishers by the hand, and
<br/>rushes out in a wild delirium of joy.]</p>
         <p>1st Pub. Ha ! ha ! ha !</p>
         <p>2d Pub. Ho! ho! ho!</p>
         <p>All the clerks. He ! he ! he !</p>
         <p>2d Pub. Porter, remove that nuisance, and then pack up
<br/>the case of Bibles.</p>
ACT III.
<p>Scene—the Unfurnished Room.</p>
         <p>The author, his wife and two children, with hands joined, dance
<br/>round the table, which has an empty ink bottle and a steel pen in the
<br/>centre. Having danced until their strength is exhausted they fall on
<br/>their knees, forming a tableau in front of the table, and the curtain
<br/>drops.</p>
  ACT IV.
<p>Scene—the Publishers as before.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. There comes that poor devil author again.
Now for more fun. Enter Writefort.</p>
         <p>Write. Sir, I have called again for the last time, ten
<br/>times have I called already. If you do not mean to pay me
<br/>anything for my work, it shall be yours for nothing, if you
<br/>will only print it.</p>
         <p>1st Pub. I could not think of accepting so valuable a
<br/>work, Sir, for nothing; and as for printing it now it is quite
<br/>impossible—we mean to erect a new steam press ex-pressly
<br/>for it.</p>
         <p>Author. But while your presses are getting ready, I am
<br/>pressed so sorely by my necessities that I cannot wait. I
<br/>must apply elsewhere, and as you have read my work you
<br/>will, of course, give me a paper setting forth its value.</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page251"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>1st Pub. That I cannot do; it’s against my principles to
<br/>recommend any work which I do not publish. Porter, give
<br/>Mr. Writefort his manuscript.</p>
         <p>Author. Pray, Sir, how is this? You say you read my
<br/>work, but the seal of the wrapper has not been broken.
<br/>Surely you have not been trifling with me ?</p>
         <p>Pub. Porter, show that gentleman to the door ; authors
<br/>are getting impudent. Fine times, indeed, when a poor dev-
<br/>il writer uses such language to a respectable dealer in books.
<br/>Trifling, indeed!</p>
         <p>Exit author with his MS. under his arm. and the act closes with a
<br/>grand laughing chorus by the publishers and his workmen.</p>
ACT V.
<p>Scene—in the street, before a cheap publication office.</p>
         <p>Writefort—[Solus.] Well, at last my work is out; pub-
<br/>lished upon the cheap and nasty plan. All my hard toil, all
<br/>my high hopes, all my fond dreams at last have come to
<br/>this. My precious work, printed on dingy paper, stitched in
<br/>a cover of dirty hue, and sold at retail for no more than a
<br/>poor quarter dollar. Well, well, I had one glorious hour,
<br/>the while I dreamed I and my wife and little ones were all
<br/>made rich by that magnificent sum! Ten thousand dollars!
<br/>’T was but a dream, but even in a dream to be so blest, was
<br/>worth the toil, and care, and wasting thought, that my great
<br/>work has cost. Who would not be an author.</p>
  ACT VI.
<p>Scene—a garret, a coffin surrounded by the author’s widow and tiro
<br/>children. She holds a copy of the London Times in her hand. She wipes
<br/>her eyes and reads.</p>
         <p>“ Mr. Bentley will publish early next month ' Writefort’s
<br/>History of Pavonia,’ in 3 vols. octavo: price two guineas.”
<br/>Too late, too late! This advertisement would have saved
<br/>my husband’s life. But cannot I and my children reap some
<br/>good from my husband’s labors? Must Mr. Bentley fatten
<br/>upon the toil of my dead husband, and I gain nothing ? O,
<br/>strange unequal world, that secures to the meanest laborer,
<br/>the mechanic, the merchant, the farmer, the fruits of their
<br/>toil, the full extent of their possessions, but leaves the au-
<br/>thor destitute of protection, a prey to every mercenary wretch
<br/>that chooses to appropriate his belongings; O, strange in-
<br/>consistent, thoughtless, heartless world !</p>
         <p>The lid of the coffin is suddenly lilted up, the author rising in the
<br/>coffin ; the widow and children are on the point of rushing out when
<br/>he calls them back and embraces them.</p>
         <p>Author. An appeal like that, a wrong so gross, an incon-
<br/>sistency so strange, an evil so monstrous, a statement so
<br/>startling, could not fail to wake the dead. I am alive again.
<br/>Dear wife, and children dear, let those write books who will,
<br/>henceforth I’ll cobble shoes, and then I shall enjoy the fruits
<br/>of my own labor.</p>
         <p>THE END.</p>

         <div class="head">ACHILLES’ WRATH.</div>
         <p>At "No. 8 Astor House,” in a style (no doubt) of luxuri-
<br/>ous elegance and ease, resides a gentleman and a scholar,
<br/>who (without paying his postage) has forwarded us a note,
<br/>(through the Despatch Post,) signing it either Mr. W. Dinne-
<br/>lord, or Mr. P. or Mr. Q. Dinneford—for he writes a shock-
<br/>ingly bad hand, and we are unable to make out all his capi-
<br/>tals with precision. It is not always the best scribe, howev-
<br/>er, physically considered, who is capable of inditing the
<br/>most agreeable note—as the note of Mr. Dinneford will
<br/>show. Here it is:</p>
         <p>SIR!		
<br/>In your note of the 2d inst. you request of me the favor of
<br/>being placed on the free list of this theatre, because (as your letter
<br/>says) you were anxious "to do Justice to 'Antigone’ on its representa-
<br/>tion.’’ Your name was accordingly placed on the free list. Your
    <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>Critique has appeared, in the Broadway Journal, characterized, much
<br/>more by ill nature and an illiberal spirit, than by fair and candid or
<br/>even just criticism.—</p>
         <p>In justice therefore to myself, I have withdrawn your name from
<br/>the free list. I am always prepar’d to submit,as a catererer for public
<br/>amusement, to any just remarks, though they may be severe, but I do
<br/>not feel myself called upon to offer facilities to any one, to do me in-
<br/>jury by animadversions evidently marked by ill feeling. I am SIR !</p>
         <div class="ab">With very great respect, Your most ob’t serv’t
    W. DINNEFORD.
    To Edgar Poe Esq. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c
    Author of THE RAVEN.
    New York APL 15, 1845. No 8 Astor House.</div>
         <p>We are not wrong (are we?) in conceiving that Mr.
<br/>Dinneford is in a passion. We are not accustomed to compo-
<br/>sitions of precisely this character—(that is to say, notes writ-
<br/>ten in large capitals with admiration notes for commas—the
<br/>whole varied occasionally with lower case)—but still, we
<br/>think ourselves justified in imagining that Mr. Dinneford
<br/>was in a passion when he sent us this note from his suite of
<br/>boudoirs at the Astor House. In fact, we fancy that we can
<br/>trace the gradations of his wrath in the number and impres-
<br/>siveness of his underscoring. The SIRS !! for example, are
<br/>exceedingly bitter ; and in THE RAVEN, which has five
<br/>black lines beneath it, each one blacker than the preceding,
<br/>we can only consider ourselves as devoted to the Infernal
<br/>Gods.</p>
         <p>Mr. Dinneford is in a passion then—but what about?
<br/>We had been given to understand, that it was usual in New
<br/>York, among editors newly established, to apply (by note)
<br/>for the customary free admission to the theatres. The cus-
<br/>tom is a wretched one, we grant, but since it was a custom,
<br/>we were weak enough, in this instance, to be guided by it.
<br/>We made our note to this Dinneford as brief and as explicit
<br/>as possible—for we felt that the task was a dirty one. We
<br/>stated distinctly that we wished to be placed on his free list
<br/>for the purpose of “doing justice to Antigone”—just as he
<br/>says himself. To this note the inhabitant of No. 8 Astor
<br/>House condescended to make no reply. Supposing that the
<br/>man “ knew no better,” and pitying his ignorance from the
<br/>bottom of our hearts, we proceeded to the theatre on its
<br/>opening night, in the full certainty of at least finding our
<br/>name on the free list. It was not there. And the blather-
<br/>skite who could behave in so indecent a manner, as to fail
<br/>first in answering our note, and secondly in paying attention
<br/>to the request it contained, has the audacity to find fault with
<br/>us because we dared to express an unbiassed opinion of his
<br/>stupidity—that is to say, of the stupidity of a play gotten up
<br/>by himself, Mr. Dinneford.</p>
         <p>He failed in his duty—there was no reason that we should
<br/>fail in ours. We told him that we meant to do him justice—
<br/>and we did it.</p>
         <p>We are not wasting words on this Quinneford—it is the
<br/>public to whom we speak—to the editorial corps in especial.
<br/>We wish to call their attention to the peculiar character of
<br/>the conditions which managers such as this have the impu-
<br/>dence to avow, as attached to the privilege of the free list.
<br/>No puff no privilege, is the contract. That is to say, an edi-
<br/>tor, when admitted to the theatre, is to be understood as
<br/>leaving his conscience in the street. He is admitted not to
<br/>judge—not to criticise—but to adulate. He is to put himself
<br/>to the inconvenience of quitting his business, or his amuse-
<br/>ment, for the purpose of observing and reporting, for the
<br/>management, whatever is occurring at the theatre. On en-
<br/>tering, he is to content himself with standing where he can—
<br/>his usual position being in the lobby, where he peeps, as well
<br/>as he may, through the Venetian shutters of the boxes—for
<br/>usually he cannot go until late, and no accommodations are
<br/>afforded him—no seats are reserved for his use. And for the
<br/>honor of doing all this, he is complimented with what ?—the<div class="pagebreak" id="#page252"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>privilege of entering the doors of the Temple consecrated to
<br/>the Quinneford—the value of the privilege in actual money,
<br/>ranging from one dollar to twenty-five cents per night; ad-
<br/>mitting that circumstances are at the very best, and that the
<br/>editor is so fortunate as to secure such a seat as he could
<br/>procure for the twenty-five cents or the dollar, paid at the
<br/>door. Deducting the difficulties and inconveniences to which
<br/>he is necessarily subjected, the privileges may be estimated
<br/>as from 6 1/4 to 12 1/2 cents per evening—a price quite sufficient,
<br/>we presume, in the opinion of the Quinnefords, for the con-
<br/>glomerated consciences of all the editors within the limits of
<br/>Christendom.</p>
         <p>We have spoken, altogether, of “ such managers” as Quin-
<br/>neford—but fortunately such managers are few. There is
<br/>certainly not in New York, at the present moment, any other
<br/>member of the theatrical profession, who either would have
<br/>behaved with the gross discourtesy of this gentleman, or
<br/>who, in inditing the preposterous letter published above,
<br/>could have proved himself, personally, so successful a “ ca-
<br/>tererer for the public amusement.”</p>

            <p>Night: a Poem. In two Parts. New York: Alexander V. Blake, 77
<br/>Fulton street. l845. pp. 60.</p>
            <p>Alexandre Dumas, in the preface to one of his tragedies,
<br/>says: “ Ce sont les hommes, et non pas 1’homme, qui in-
<br/>ventent. Chacun arrive à son tour et à son heure, s'empare
<br/>des choses connues de ses pères, les met en œuvre par des
<br/>combinaisons nouvelles, puis meurt après avoir ajouté quel-
<br/>ques parcelles à la somme des connaissances humaines.
<br/>Quant à la crèation complète d’une chose, je la crois impos-
<br/>sible. Dieu lui même, lorsqu’il crea l'homme, ne put on n’osa
<br/>point 1’inventer: il le fit à son image.</p>
            <p>We should be unwilling to charge the author of the poem
<br/>before us with the profane sentiment of the audacious pla-
<br/>giarist whom we have quoted, but it is very plain that the
<br/>two authors entertain very similar feelings respecting des
<br/>choses connues de ses pères.</p>
            <p>The author of Night has chosen an infelicitous title for his
<br/>poem, for the word “Thoughts,” must pop into the minds of
<br/>his readers as soon as they open his volume: yet it would
<br/>have mattered nothing if he had chosen a different one, for
<br/>the same title would have been inevitably suggested by the
<br/>poem itself.</p>
            <p>We can safely pronounce the author a good man and a
<br/>scholar, which is higher praise than can be bestowed upon
<br/>every good poet. His withholding his name from his com-
<br/>binaisons nouvelles proves him to be a modest man, at least.
<br/>The volume makes a favorable appeal to the eye, if not to
<br/>he heart, by its beautiful externals. It is one of the hand-
<br/>somest books that we have recently handled.</p>
            <p>There are many lines like the following in the poem,
<br/>which might be vastly improved by the alteration of one
<br/>word: “From morn to noon, from noon to dusky eve.”
<br/>if dewy were substituted for dusky, the line would then be
<br/>quite perfect and original. As an example of the author’s
<br/>art and feeling, we make as long an extract as we can afford
<br/>room for.</p>

            <div class="head">Imagination and Fancy.</div>
            <p>Imagination and Fancy. By Leigh Hunt. No. IV of the “ Library
<br/>of Choice Reading,” published by Mess. Wiley and Putnam.</p>
            <p>A better work than this, for the purpose of the “ Library”
<br/>could scarcely have been selected.</p>
            <p>The delicate taste and fine fancy of Leigh Hunt are, at
<br/>the present day, as warmly admitted, as many years ago
<br/>they were clamorously denied. His exquisite sensibility to
<br/>all impressions of the beautiful; his scholarship (by no
<br/>means profound, yet peculiarly available) ; and his general
<br/>vivacity of intellect—render him an admirable critic on all
<br/>points within the compass of these qualities. No man living
<br/>can put a truly good book of ordinary literature, in a better
<br/>light than he. In poetical criticism, especially, he is at
<br/>home—to the extent we have suggested. His mode is to
<br/>give a running commentary on the poem, citing largely, Ital-
<br/>icizing such passages as strike his fancy, and expatiating on
<br/>the effects produced: his sole object, apparently, being to
<br/>extort from the work the greatest amount of beauty which
<br/>it can be made to yield. This, undoubtedly, is a very cap-
<br/>tivating method, and mankind are by no means the more dis-
<br/>posed to quarrel with it on the ground that it is sometimes
<br/>less useful (if the term may be here applied) than delight-
<br/>ful.</p>
            <p>But these are not all the capacities of Hunt. He theorises
<br/>with great ability. An instinct of the fitting—a profound
<br/>sentiment of the true, the graceful, the musical, the beauti-
<br/>ful in every shape—enables him to construct critical princi-
<br/>ples which are thoroughly consistent with Nature, and which
<br/>thus serve admirably as a substructure for Art. But it is in
<br/>the power of passing behind his principles, that he utterly
<br/>and radically fails. Of their composition—of their machi-
<br/>nery—he is as ignorant as a child. If any thing goes wrong
<br/>with his critical clock-work, he remains profoundly and cu-
<br/>riously embarrassed—not having the commonest idea of the
<br/>steps to be taken to set it in order. He tells us that a pas-
<br/>sage is beautiful, and very usually (though not always) we
<br/>admit that he is right. He insists on its beauty, and we still
<br/>coincide. He expatiates on it until we grow warm in his
<br/>warmth. He demonstrates to our satisfaction how it is beau-
<br/>tiful and at what particular points it is beautiful, and some-
<br/>times adventures so far as to assure us (while we agree with
<br/>him) that it would be still better at certain other points if
<br/>written so and so—and then should we be so inconsiderate as
<br/>to ask him why it is beautiful, he would be altogether at a
<br/>loss for an answer.</p>
            <p>In a word the forte of the author of Rimini is taste—while
<br/>his foible is analysis. Of this latter quality—absolutely in-
<br/>dispensable in all criticism that aims at instruction or reform-
<br/>ation in letters—he is radically deficient. He himself feels
<br/>his own ability to construct a fine poem, and is content to be
<br/>assured of the validity of the principles upon which he con-
<br/>structs it, without caring to understand the ultimate character
<br/>of the natural laws (of the heart and intellect) upon which
<br/>the validity of the principles depends. Feeling thus, he is
<br/>prone to suppose that in all men the ability may exist with-
<br/>out the understanding—and his criticisms therefore take no
<br/>account of the latter. He neglects it first, because he does
<br/>not appreciate its necessity (since it is no necessity for him)
<br/>and secondly through absolute incapacity for its discussion.
<br/>Now the one cause predominates in him and now the other.
<br/>We can at all time trust his comments of love and admira-<div class="pagebreak" id="#page253"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>tion, and we may put faith to a very great extent in his defi-
<br/>nitions or general conclusions in art, but we must never ask
<br/>of him too inquisitively, by what process they have been at-
<br/>tained, or request him to put us in a condition for the attain-
<br/>ment of similar conclusions for ourselves.</p>
            <p>Now we are quite sure that the author of “ Imagination
<br/>and Fancy” would deny in a great measure the utility of
<br/>that analysis for which we contend—but he would deny it
<br/>just as a man born blind might be led to deny the utility of
<br/>light. A far greater than Leigh Hunt has, in fact, denied it
<br/>as far as he could, through implication, in the case of Lord
<br/>Verülam. We allude to Macaulay, who is at much pains to
<br/>detract from the wisest and brightest (we will not say the
<br/>meanest of mankind) on the ground that the inductive pro-
<br/>cesses of reason teach us to reason no better in teaching us
<br/>the modes in which we reason. It is Macaulay who maintains,
<br/>in other words, that a man is enabled to labor to no greater
<br/>advantage by any understanding of the tools with which
<br/>he labors, or of the material upon which his labor is bestow-
<br/>ed ! The reply to all this is, that Thomas Babington Macau-
<br/>lay is not a man of genius. He is a critic, but no more than a
<br/>critic. We grant that the “Lays of Ancient Rome” would
<br/>have received little or no improvement from any understand-
<br/>ing, on the part of their author, of the processes of thought
<br/>which enabled him to put them together. Their merit or
<br/>demerit, in fact, is quite independent of any such understand-
<br/>ing—the truth, after all, seeming to resolve itself into this—
<br/>that the value of the comprehension of which we speak, is
<br/>in the direct ratio of the creative ability which employs
<br/>or takes advantage of the comprehension. In this sense,
<br/>there are few who would deny that to Leigh Hunt the faculty
<br/>of analysis would be of greater moment than to Macaulay:—
<br/>and if we have expressed ourselves of the admirable work
<br/>before us less warmly than may seem fitting, it is not that
<br/>we fail to appreciate, or are unwilling to admit its merits,
<br/>but that we feel a sentiment half of grief half of vexation, at
<br/>perceiving how very narrowly it has missed being more meri-
<br/>torious, by a hundred fold at least, than it actually is, as we
<br/>now see it.</p>
            <p>It would be doing our subject injustice not to give our
<br/>readers at least one extract from the volume. We choose
<br/>the concluding paragraphs of an answer to the query “ what
<br/>is poetry ?”</p>
            <p>I cannot draw this essay towards its conclusion better than with
<br/>three memorable words of Milton; who has said, that poetry in com-
<br/>parison with science, is “ simple, sensuous, and passionate.” By sim-
<br/>ple, he means unperplexed and self-evident; by sensuous, genial and
<br/>full of Imagery; by passionate, excited and enthusiastic. I am
<br/>aware that different constructions have been put upon some of these
<br/>words; but the context seems to me to necessitate those before us. I
<br/>quote, however, not from the original, but from an extract in the Re-
<br/>marks on Paradise Lost by Richardson.</p>
            <p>What the poet has to cultivate above all things is love and truth;—
<br/>what he has to avoid like poison, is the fleeting and the false. He
<br/>will get no good by proposing to be “ in earnest at the moment. His
<br/>earnestness must be innate and habitual; born with him, and felt to
<br/>be his most precious inheritance. “ I expect neither protit nor gene-
<br/>ral fame by my writings,” says Coleridge in his Preface to his Poems;
<br/>“ and I consider myself as having been amply repaid without either.
<br/>Poetry has been to me its ‘own exceeding great reward:' it has sooth-
<br/>ed my afflictions ; it has multiplied and refined my enjoyments; it has
<br/>endeared solitude ; it has given me the habit of wishing to discover
<br/>the good and the beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.’ —Pick-
       <br/>ering’s edition, p. 10.</p>	
            <p>Poetry,” says Shelley, “ lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of
<br/>the world, and makes familiar objects be at if they were not familiar.
<br/>It reproduces all that it represents ; and the impersonations clothed
<br/>in its Elysian light stand thenceforward in the minds of those who
<br/>have once contemplated them, as memorials of that gentle and exalt-
<br/>ed content which extends itself over all thoughts and actions with
<br/>which it co-exists. The great secret of morals is love, or a going out
<br/>of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beauti-
<br/>ful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man,
<br/>to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively ; he
<br/>must put himself in the place of another, and of many others: the
<br/>pains and pleasures of hie species most become his own. The great
<br/>instrument of moral good is imagination ; and poetry administers to
  <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>the effect by acting upon the cause.”—Essays and Letters,vol. i. p. 16.</p>
            <p>I would not willingly say anything after perorations like these ;
<br/>but as treatises on poetry may chance to have auditors who think
<br/>themselves called upon to vindicate the superiority of what is termed
<br/>useful knowledge, it may be as well to add, that if the poet may be
<br/>allowed to pique himself on any one thing more than another, com-
<br/>pared with those who undervalue him, it is on that power of underval-
<br/>ing nobody, and no attainments different from his own, which is giv-
<br/>en him by the very faculty of imagination they despise. The greater
<br/>includes the less. They do not see that their inability to comprehend
<br/>him argues the smaller capacity.</p>
            <p>No man recognizes the worth of utility more than the poet: he only
<br/>desires that the meaning of the term may not come short of its great-
<br/>ness, and exclude the noblest necessities of his fellow-creatures. He
<br/>is quite as much pleased, for instance, with the facilities for rapid
<br/>conveyance afforded him by the railroad, as the dullest confiner of its
<br/>advantages to that single idea, or as the greatest two-idead man who
<br/>varies that single idea with hugging himself on his “ buttons” or his
<br/>good dinner. But he sees also the beauty of the country through
<br/>which he passes, of the towns, of the heavens, of the steam-engine it-
<br/>self, thundering and fuming along like a magic horse, of the affections
<br/>that are carrying, perhaps, half the passengers on their journey, nay,
<br/>of those of the great two-idead man ; and beyond all this, he discerns
<br/>the incalulable amount of good, and knowledge, and refinement, and
<br/>mutual consideration, which this wonderful invention is fitted to cir-
<br/>culate over the globe, perhaps to the displacement of war itself, and
<br/>certainly to the diffusion of millions of enjoyments.</p>
            <p>“ And a button-maker, after all, invented it!” cries our friend.</p>
            <p>Pardon me—it was a nobleman. A button-maker may be a very
<br/>excellent, and a very poetical man, too, and yet not have been the first
<br/>man visited by a sense of the gigantic powers of the combination of
<br/>water and fire. It was a nobleman who first thought of it,—a cap-
<br/>tain who first tried it,—and a button-maker who perfected it. And
<br/>he who put the nobleman on such thoughts, was the great philosopher
<br/>Bacon, who said that poetry had “ something divine in it,” and was
<br/>necessary to the satisfaction of the human mind.</p>

            <p>The system of Mnemotechny invented by M. Gouraud compares

         <p>The Indian Guide.—A capital painting, of this name, has recently
<br/>been added to the collection of the Art-Union of this city. It is the work
<br/>of Charles Deas, formerly of New York, but at present residing in St.
<br/>Louis. Those who admired his “ Long Jake,” the Santa Fe trader,
<br/>will understand the merit of the "Indian Guide,” when we say that
<br/>it would form an admirable companion to that picture.</p>
         <p>The Indian Guide is a half-breed; a tall gaunt figure, mounted on a
<br/>pony, moving at a rapid gallop across a prairie : there is no other figure
<br/>in sight, excepting an emigrant standing at his wagon in the extreme
<br/>distance. The pony must be a veritable portrait; he is as character-
<br/>istic in his hide and trappings as his rider. He has been shorn of eve-
<br/>ry thing not essential to vitality—cars, mane, and tail; and his hide
<br/>has been branded by the marking iron of successive owners. The
<br/>Guide carries a long-barrelled fowling piece in his hand; and slung at
<br/>his back, there is some kind of game that he has just killed. The
<br/>purple sky, though apparently greatly exaggerated in color, is doubtless
<br/>true to nature, and it helps to give an air of mystery and wildness to
<br/>the whole composition.</p>
         <p>Mr. Deas is not one of the ideal school; he loves to paint Nature as
<br/>he finds her, modestly doubting his ability to improve upon her mod-
<br/>els. Excepting Mount, he is the most purely American in his feelings
<br/>of any painter that we have produced. There is nothing foreign, no-
<br/>thing copied from other pictures in any of his compositions that we
<br/>have seen; every thing about them has an air of genuineness that
<br/>impresses you with the feeling of truth. Among the wild frontier men
<br/>of the West, Mr. Deas will find many subjects for his pencil, which, we
<br/>trust, will keep him well employed, and we hope to see many compan-
<br/>ions to “ Long Jake” and the “ Indian Guide.” Pictures of pure sa-
<br/>vage life, like those by Mr. Catlin, cannot excite our sympathies as
<br/>strongly as do the representations of beings who belong to our own
<br/>race. The Indian stands at an impassable remove from civilization,
<br/>but the half-breed forms a connecting link between the white and red
<br/>races; we feel a sympathy for the Indian Guide that we never could
<br/>for the painted savage, for we see that he has a tincture of our own
<br/>blood, and his trappings show that he has taken one step towards re-
<br/>finement and civilized life.</p>
         <p>There is another picture of genuine American feeling just added to
<br/>the exhibition of the Art-Uuion, from an opposite extreme of the coun-
<br/>try to that from which the Indian Guide has come. A landscape by
<br/>Mr. Harry of Boston, representing an early snow scene at the head of
<br/>the Penobscot river. Though the river is frozen and the ground and
<br/>trees are covered with a frosty rime, there is a warm haze in the air
<br/>which looks like Indian summer. It is a very charming picture, infi-
<br/>nitely better than some others which we have seen by the same artist.</p>
         <p>The National Academy.—The Annual Exhibition of this Institu-
<br/>tion was opened to the public on the 17th inst. From a hasty glance
<br/>at the pictures, we should say that there were more good ones than any
<br/>exhibition has contained since the first opening of the Academy. We
<br/>shall notice them at length next week.</p>

for sale by E. H. Wade, 197 Washington street, Boston.</p>
         <p>No. 1, is a set of Scotch Polkas, the airs of which are formed from
<br/>the real old Scotch tunes, put into Polka time. They are exceedingly
<br/>pretty Polkas, and are excellent for dancing. They are got out in the
<br/>most costly style, the title page, representing a couple in tartan, exe-
<br/>cuting one of the figures of the dance, is most gorgeously emblazoned
<br/>with gold and colors. It would be a beautiful embellishment to any
<br/>collection.</p>
         <p>No. 2. The Theme on which these variations are founded, has been
<br/>generally attributed to Beethoven, but the Germans now give it to F.
<br/>Schubert. It is a lovely waltz, and it is but fair that the composer
<br/>should have just credit for the work. The variations by Charles Mey-
<br/>er, are chaste and elegant, and require a light finger and flexible wrist
<br/>to do them justice. The andante is extremely beautiful; the second
<br/>variation and the finale are brilliant and effective. On the whole, this
<br/>piece is worthy the attention of every amateur who possesses good
<br/>musical taste and a moderate degree of skill.</p>
         <p>In the third bar of the theme the E in the bass should be marked
<br/>sharp.</p>
         <p>No. 3. This is the celebrated Polka, composed by Strauss, to which
<br/>words have been adapted, descriptive of the grief of a young maiden,
<br/>who is forbidden to join in the sports of those of her own age, because
<br/>she has a lover and staid out rather late. A very hard case, to our
<br/>thinking.</p>
         <p>At the back of the title-page there is an interesting account of the
<br/>supposed early origin and the authenticated modern resuscitation of
<br/>the Polka.</p>
         <p>The name itself is claimed to be of Latin derivation, and from its
<br/>antiquity, the dance becomes as respectable as it is fascinating. We
<br/>should like to copy the whole of the veritable history, but must be
<br/>content to refer our readers to the song, which will recommend itself
<br/>very generally by its melodious and pleasing character.</p>
         <p>No. 4 is a brilliant Fantasia, introducing two of the most popular
<br/>and pleasing airs from the Guillaume Tell of Rossini. The introduc-
<br/>tion is appropriate, giving a shadowing forth of one of the themes.
<br/>The airs and the variations are well arranged, very pleasing in their
<br/>character, and lay well under the finger- Mr. Maeder bas produced
<br/>a piece which will be very popular, because it is easy, and every one
<br/>has the themes by heart.</p>
         <p>No. 5. A song by Mr. Henry Russell—one of his favorite waltz
<br/>movements, made up from many things, the principal ingredients being
<br/>three-eighths Strauss, two-eighths Auber, and the remainder selected
<br/>from the familiar common-place material, floating about and always
<br/>on hand. This mixture, alter having been well shaken up, resolves
<br/>itself into something very palatable, and peculiarly adapted to the
<br/>general taste. We shall not pretend to criticise this song, because
<br/>the absence of all thought from the composition renders it quite unne-
<br/>cessary. It is a difficult thing to analyse nothing.</p>
         <p>We must, however, in fairness state, that by ingeniously dovetailing
<br/>a number of separate phrases, a so-called pretty melody has been pro-
<br/>duced, which will doubtless sell the song.</p>
         <p>No. 6, is one of a thousand pleasing ballads from the prolific pen of
<br/>George Linley. This gentleman is both poet and musician, and has
<br/>produced some of the sweetest ballads in the language. Sweet Haw.
<br/>thorn-den is simple and expressive, and is to be commended for the
<br/>fact that there is no evidence of any straining after effect. It is well
<br/>suited to a light treble voice, or limited tenor voice, its compass only
<br/>reaching a ninth.</p>
         <p>No. 7, is a charming study, by Thalberg, in A Minor. Unlike the
</p>
         <p>generality of this composer’s pieces, the one before us presents but few
<br/>difficulties. It is simply an accompanied air, which, by the bye
<br/>though of a mournful character, is not distinguished either for its
<br/>merit or its originality. This piece will be found a very capital exer-
<br/>cise, and especially adapted to strengthen the fingers of the right hand.
<br/>It is most admirably got out, with a very elegant title page. Indeed,
<br/>all the music published by Messrs. Oakes and Wade, of Boston, is dis-
<br/>tinguished by the excellence and elegance of its mechanical depart-
<br/>ment, both in the interior and the exterior of the works published. The
<br/>liberality and enterprise of these gentlemen fully merit the large pa-
<br/>tronage bestowed upon them by the public.</p>

            <div class="head">American Engravings in England.</div>
            <p>American Engravings in England.—A case has recently
<br/>occurred at the Custom-house, in London, which cannot fail to inter-
<br/>est many of our readers. Some lime ago a work was published in
<br/>New York, descriptive of the art of weaving, illustrated by a vast
<br/>number of prints, showing that process in all its stages. It appears
<br/>that the same work has been recently reprinted in London, by Wiley
<br/>and Putnam, and that its publishers have imported several prints, ex-
<br/>cuted in the United States, intending, as they state, to unite these for-
<br/>eign prints with the British letter press. The officers of the Customs
<br/>charged these prints with the separate duty of 1d. per print, of which
<br/>the parties complained to the Treasury, who referred the matter to
<br/>the Board of Trade. The latter board recommended the Treasury to
<br/>admit these prints at the duty of £2 10s. per cwt.,—that being the
<br/>amount of duty chargeable on books,—on the ground that, if the prints
<br/>had accompanied the letter press, they being subsidiary,—that is,
<br/>merely illustrative of the subject of the work,—they would have been
<br/>admissible as a book at the said duty, viz., at £2 10s.per cwt;  con-
<br/>sidering that the letter-press should not be put upon a worse footing
<br/>for having been printed in England than if it had been printed in the Uni-
<br/>ted States. But their lordships required evidence of the fact alleged,
<br/>namely, that the work in question has actually been printed in Eng-
<br/>land. The recommendation has been acted upon.</p>

            <p>Monumental Loaves.—At a late missionary meeting in
<br/>England, a speaker related the following anecdote, in illustration of
<br/>his remark that “ avarice never prospered any people.”</p>
            <p>“ He remembered a baker that was very niggardly, and he was de-
<br/>sirous of repairing his oven. Well, how to do this on economical prin-
<br/>ciples was the desideratum. Fire bricks were costly, very costly.—
<br/>What could he get ? Oh, he had it! There were some grave stones,
<br/>which, if he could nicely get hold of, would suit very well. Could he
<br/>get them snugly, the job would soon be done. No matter how, but he
<br/>got hold of them, and immediately set to work at his oven. He en-
<br/>larged it, and flagged it with the fragments of grave-stones ; but with-
<br/>out thought, he placed the lettered side up. The 'baking day’ took
<br/>took place. His neighbors bought their loaves. Mind, they were not
<br/>in tins, but were oven-bottomed loaves, that is, the dough baked on
<br/>the oven bottom without tins. They were duly baked. The neigh-
<br/>bors fetched the loaves, but, astonishment! What magic ! On one
<br/>loaf was ‘ departed this life,’ on another, ‘aged seventy-six years,’
<br/>&amp;c. The tale soon got out, and the baker was never troubled to bake
<br/>another, and soon was ruined. His covetousness punished himself,
<br/>and so it would be with all those professing but not acting with that
<br/>liberality that became Christians.”</p>

<br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
<br/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<br/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<br/>given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<br/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<br/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en
<br/>abled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musi
<br/>cians.
<br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
<br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
<br/>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<br/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
<br/>over ail others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<br/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the

<br/>From the Rev. R. T. Huddart, (Classical Academy, Houston street.)
<br/>It affords me much pleasure to add my testimony to the value, importance,
<br/>and advantage of Mr. George Vandenhoff’s Work on Elocution. He has
<br/>aptly styled it “ a plain System such it truly is to those who will pursue
<br/>the instruction given, step by step; and cannot fail of producing a beneficial
<br/>and much wished for result in one of the departments of education so sadly
<br/>neglected—correct reading—devoid of vulgarities, and errors in articulation
<br/>and pronunciation. I hope the book will have a wide circulation, in order
<br/>that the good which it is capable of effecting may be thus more extensively
<br/>diffused, and a better system of instruction be afforded to the rising genera-

<br/>gentleman’s education, namely, “ Logical and Musical Declamation.”
