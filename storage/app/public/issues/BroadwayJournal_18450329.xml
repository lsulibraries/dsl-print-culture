The Amber Witch. No 2, of Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library of Choice Read-
ing. Price 37 1-2 cents.
</p>
         <p>It was a piece of rare good luck that the projectors of this
<br/>praise-worthy series of choice books could begin their library
<br/>with two works, so perfect in their kind as Eӧthen and the
<br/>Amber Witch ; and it will be a piece of luck still more rare,
<br/>if the works which come alter, do not suffer by comparison
<br/>with them. The British press has given so wide a currency
<br/>to laudatory criticisms on the Amber Witch, that we are de-
<br/>prived of the pleasure of uttering any thing new in the way of
<br/>praise on the same subject. Any thing savoring of dispraise
<br/>in respect of this beautiful work, would be entirely new
<br/>and startling ; for we believe that no critic has yet had the
<br/>temerity to risk his own reputation by undervaluing a pro-
<br/>duction whose merits will be appreciated as readily by the
<br/>unlearned as the learned reader. Although it is, probably,
<br/>as truthful a romance as ever has been written, that is, makes
<br/>as near an approach to the thing it pretends to be, a true
<br/>history, it is a matter of surprise that the author did not render
<br/>it more truthful than it is, by suffering the witch to be burned.
<br/>Not only is the moral of the narrative destroyed by the de-
<br/>nouement, but the moment we begin to suspect that she
<br/>will be rescued from the flames, the conviction that we are
<br/>reading a true narrative begins to be shaken. It is, unques-
<br/>tionably, a more delightful romance for ending as it does,
<br/>but if it be true, that Dr. Meinhold published it as an experi-
<br/>ment upon the critical powers of the Tubingen reviewers,
<br/>we wonder as much at his giving the story an ending so
<br/>purely artificial, as we do at the obtuseness of the critics who
<br/>are reported to have received it as a genuine chronicle.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Although a cheaper edition of the Amber Witch has al-
<br/>ready been published, we are sure that even those who may
<br/>possess it in a homelier form, will be glad to have it in the
<br/>elegant shape in which it is now presented.</p>
         <p>The Children or Mount Ida. By Mrs. Child.
</p>
         <p>This classic tale, by Mrs. Child, is the most simple and
<br/>Perfect story that any American woman has yet produced.
<br/>Were it not for a superlative adjective, here and there, and
<br/>sometimes a magazine platitude, it might be passed off for
<br/>an old Greek legend. It has much of the sweet simplicity
<br/>and touching passion of the story of Cupid and Psyche, and
<br/>in purity of thought and elevated imagination, we have read
<br/>no composition of late years that equals it. We trust that
<br/>those who have been in the habit of representing Mrs. Child
<br/>as a writer of extravagant fancies, will read this simple and
<br/>chaste production. A story like this could only come from a
<br/>mind the reverse of extravagant. Its faults are those which
<br/>must always mar the productions of an imagination teeming
<br/>with rich fancies,—faults that appear like beauties in the</p>
         <p/>
         <p>writings of a less gifted mind. Mrs. Child has, unconsciously
<br/>we suspect, drawn the portrait of a perfect woman, a wife and
<br/>mother, in Œnone, a very different being from the Glumdal-
<br/>clitches who form the ideal of Miss Fuller’s women. Cory-
<br/>thus is, too, we fear, almost as near an approach to as per-
<br/>fect a man as our imperfect nature has yet developed.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The story of Œnone and Corythus however, is something
<br/>more than a simple Greek legend ; in the disguise of a fic-
<br/>tion Mrs. C. has introduced one of the marvelous psychologi-
<br/>cal developments, which have become too common in our
<br/>day, to be laughed out of countenance by our wise men who
<br/>will receive no truths less than a century old. The clairvoy-
<br/>ance of Œnone is not in the least startling on Mount Ida;
<br/>it harmonises with the old Greek legends, as naturally as
<br/>though it had sprung from Greece, proving that the fables
<br/>of her mythology had a deeper foundation to rest upon than
<br/>the chimeras of barbarous ignorance. Œnone hastening her
<br/>own calamities by her unconscious revelations, made while
<br/>in the sleep that the unconscious powers of Corythus had
<br/>produced, is so pure and tragic, that it hardly reads like a
<br/>new invention. There cannot be a finer incident for the
<br/>uses of tragedy ; the clap-traps of poisoned bowls and daggers
<br/>are mere gewgaws compared with this terrible power by
<br/>which Fate compels her victims to be the instruments of
<br/>their own ruin.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mrs. Child is too pure and gentle a spirit to harrow the
<br/>soul by pictures of remorse and suffering, but she has em-
<br/>ployed an incident of daily occurrence, (at least of reported
<br/>daily occurrence, and for the uses of fiction, it is immaterial
<br/>whether the reports be true or false,) to produce a catastro-
<br/>phe as purely tragical in its developement as any in the
<br/>range of fiction.</p>
         <p>The I.ibrary of Commerce: Practical, Theoretical, and Historical. By
Freeman Hunt, Editor of the Merchants’ Magazine. Vol. 1. 142 Fulton
street. 1845.
</p>
         <p>This is the first number of “ Hunt’s Library of Commerce,”
<br/>an important and much needed series of books, which the
<br/>well known editor of the Merchants’ Magazine has underta-
<br/>ken to publish.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The present volume contains a sketch of the commer-
<br/>cial intercourse of the world with China; a history of the
<br/>British Corn laws; and Memoirs of Commercial Delusions:
<br/>embracing sketches of the Mississippi scheme and the South
<br/>Sea bubble. The first article, we presume to be from the
<br/>pen of the editor; the others are republications from English
<br/>works. The most valuable part of the book is that which
<br/>relates to Commercial Delusions, because it shows, in a man-
<br/>ner which cannot be misunderstood, the disastrous effects
<br/>which must always follow all commercial speculations, when
<br/>they are carried to excess. There are speculations of daily
<br/>occurrence in our community, based upon no surer ground
<br/>than those projected by Law and Scraggs, which do not
<br/>create as much distress, only because they are not as widely
<br/>spread as were the operations of those arch-financiers. A
<br/>company was projected in Wall street, the past winter, in</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page194"/>
         </p>
         <p>which several men of capital embarked, which was hardly
<br/>more explicit in its objects than one started by a great genius
<br/>in the time of the South Sea Bubble, entitled “ A Company
<br/>for carrying on an Undertaking of Great Advantage, but No-
<br/>body to know what it is.” The projector of this surprising
<br/>adventure is said to have gained two thousand pounds in
<br/>instalments of 5 per cent, from subscribers to shares. The
<br/>profits, of course, were nothing to nobody, excepting himself.
<br/>If the mania for “companies” to do every thing, should ever
<br/>return to this city, we hope to see a company started for
<br/>keeping the streets free from mud. We think that if any
<br/>enterprising genius should open the books for subscription to
<br/>such stock even now, he could not fail to receive a very great
<br/>number of subscriptions.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Library of Commerce is published in a very neat form,
<br/>and handsomely printed, it will, of course, be a prominent
<br/>volume on every merchant’s book-shelves.</p>

         <p>Popular LECTURE on Astronomy. By M. Arago, with additions and cor-
<br/>rections by Dionysius Lardner, L.L. D. Greeley &amp; McElrath, Tribune
<br/>Buildings. 1645. Price 25 cents.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If M. Arago should ever chance to see a copy of this work,
<br/>it would, probably, cause him as much surprise as the last
<br/>comet did, which caught him napping. It is, unquestionably,
<br/>a very excellent book for popular reading, and to those who
<br/>know nothing about Astronomy, it will, as any work on As-
<br/>tronomy could not fail to do, convey many great truths which
<br/>they will be the better for knowing. Nearly one half of the
<br/>book has been contributed by Dr. Lardner, and the balance is
<br/>ascribed to M. Arago, but as it was published from notes
<br/>improperly taken, to which he never gave his consent, it is
<br/>hardly doing him justice to pass it off as his work. The
<br/>publishers give a perfectly satisfactory account of the manner
<br/>in which it was obtained, and excuse themselves for repub-
<br/>lishing it by urging a plea very common with certain kinds
<br/>of people, “ if they did not, somebody else would.” Perhaps
<br/>we are a little too strict in regard to the publication of other
<br/>people’s property without their permission, but there are so
<br/>few in the country who err in this manner, that we may be
<br/>forgiven for erring on the same side.</p>
         <p>M. Arago asks two questions in his lecture on comets, only
one of which he answers.
“ If the Moon is an old comet, what has she done with
her hair!”
“ What would be the consequence if the Earth should ever
become the satellite of a comet ?”
</p>
         <p>In reply to this last supposition, M. Arago quiets the fears
<br/>of the Earthites, by a very ingenious theory, from which it
<br/>appears, that instead of the Earth being alternately vitrified,
<br/>liquified, and congealed as it approached and receded from
<br/>the sun, its condition would not very materially be changed,
<br/>and that at its aphelion and perihelion, its temperature would
<br/>not vary much more than it does now. “There is nothing,
<br/>therefore, to prove,” M. Arago is made to say, and perhaps did
<br/>say; “ that in the hypothesis that the Earth should become
<br/>the satellite of a comet, the human race must necessarily per-
<br/>ish from thermometric changes." An exceedingly consoling
<br/>theory; for although we Earthites might not altogether be sat-
<br/>isfied with so secondary a position in the Universe, as that of a
<br/>satellite to a vagabond comet, still we need entertain no
<br/>harassing fears of danger to life and property in the case of
<br/>such an event taking place. But we trust it will be a long
<br/>time before any comet shall think of annexation with an eye
<br/>to our own planet; and we have no doubt that even our friends
<br/>at the south, as zealous they are for annexation of another
<br/>kind, would sturdily oppose this.</p>
         <p>The World in a Pocket-Book. Geo. S. Appleton, Philadelphia, and Apple-
ton ic Co., New York. 3d edition.
</p>
         <p>An exceedingly neat pocket volume, the contents of which
<br/>fulfill the promise of the title, imposing as it is. One of
<br/>the chapters, “ The Genius of the World,” is quite novel in
<br/>its way. The time from Moses to 1840, is compressed into
<br/>five pages; all the genius of the world in so small a space !
<br/>Alas for genius!</p>
         <p>Imitation—Plagiarism—The conclusion of Mr. Poe’s reply to
THE LETTER OF OUTIS.
</p>
         <p>“I have written what I have written,” says Outis, “from
<br/>no personal motives, but simply because, from my earliest rea-
<br/>ding of reviews and critical notices, I have been disgusted
<br/>with this wholesale mangling of victims without rhyme or
<br/>reason.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I have already agreed to believe implicitly every thing as-
<br/>serted by the anonymous Outis, and am fully prepared to ad-
<br/>mit, even, his own contradictions, in one sentence, of what
<br/>he has insisted upon in the sentence preceding. I shall as-
<br/>sume it as indisputable, then, (since Nobody says it) that,
<br/>first, he has no acquaintance with myself and “ some acquain-
<br/>tance with Mr. Longfellow,” and secondly, that he has
<br/>“ written what he has written from no personal motives
<br/>whatever.” That he has been disgusted with “ the mang-
<br/>ling of victims without rhyme or reason,” is, to be sure, a
<br/>little unaccountable, for the victims without rhyme or rea-
<br/>son are precisely the victims that ought to be mangled; but
<br/>that he has been disgusted “ from his earliest reading” with
<br/>critical notices and reviews, is credible enough if we but ima-
<br/>gine his “ earliest reading” and earliest writing to have taken
<br/>place about the same epoch of time.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But to be serious ; if Outis has his own private reasons for
<br/>being disgusted with what he terms the “ wholesale mang-
<br/>ling of victims without rhyme or reason,” there is not a man
<br/>living, of common sense and common honesty, who has not
<br/>better reason (if possible) to be disgusted with the insuffera-
<br/>ble cant and shameless misrepresentation practised habitu-
<br/>ally by just such persons as Outis, with the view of decry-
<br/>ing by sheer strength of lungs—of trampling down—of riot-
<br/>ing down—of mobbing down any man with a soul that bids
<br/>him come out from among the general corruption of our pub-
<br/>lic press, and take his stand upon the open ground of recti-
<br/>tude and honor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Outises who practise this species of bullyism are, as
<br/>a matter of course, anonymous. They are either the “ vic-
<br/>tims without rhyme or reason who have been mangled by
<br/>wholesale,” or they are the relatives, or the relatives of the
<br/>relatives of the “ victims without rhyme or reason who have
<br/>been mangled by wholesale.” Their watchwords are “ carping
<br/>littleness,” “ envious malignity,” and “personal abuse.” Their
<br/>low artifices arc insinuated calumnies, and indefatigable whis-
<br/>pers of regret, from post to pillar, that “ Mr. So-and-So, or Mr.
<br/>This-and-That will persist in rendering himself so dreadfully
<br/>unpopular”—no one, in the meantime, being more thoroughly
<br/>and painfully aware thau these very Outises, that the un-
<br/>popularity of the just critic who reasons his way, guiltless of
<br/>dogmatism, is confined altogether within the limits of the
<br/>influence of the victims without rhyme and reason who
<br/>have been mangled by wholesale. Even the manifest in-
<br/>justice of a Gifford is, I grieve to say, an exceedingly popu-
<br/>lar thing; and there is no literary element of popularity more
<br/>absolutely and more universally effective than the pun-
<br/>gent impartiality of a Wilson or a Macaulay. In regard to
<br/>my own course—without daring to arrogate to myself a sin-
<br/>gle other quality of either of these eminent men than that
<br/>pure contempt for mere prejudice and conventionality which</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page195"/>
         </p>
         <p>actuated them all, I will now unscrupulously call the atten- J
<br/>tion of the Outises to the fact, that it was during what they
<br/>(the Outises) would insinuate to be the unpopularity of my
<br/>“ wholesale mangling of the victims without rhyme and
<br/>reason” that, in one year, the circulation of the “Southern
<br/>Messenger” (a five-dollar journal) extended itself from seven [
<br/>hundred to nearly five thousand,—and that, in little more
<br/>than twice the same time, “ Graham’s Magazine” swelled
<br/>its list from five to fifty-two thousand subscribers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I make no apology for these egotisms, and I proceed with
<br/>them without hesitation—for, in myself, I am but defending
<br/>a set of principles which no honest man need be ashamed of
<br/>defending, and for whose defence no honest man will consi-
<br/>der an apology required.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The usual watchwords of the Outises, when repelling a
<br/>criticism,—their customary charges, overt or insinuated, are
<br/>(as I have already said) those of “personal abuse” and
<br/>“ wholesale (or indiscriminate) mangling.” In the present
<br/>instance the latter solely is employed—for not even an Outis
<br/>can acuse me, with even a decent show of verisimilitude, of
<br/>having ever descended, in the most condemnatory of my re-
<br/>views, to that personal abuse which, upon one or two occa-
<br/>sions, has indeed been levelled at myself, in the spasmodic
<br/>endeavours of aggrieved authors to rebut what I have ven-
<br/>tured to demonstrate.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I have then to refute only the accusation of mangling by
<br/>wholesale—and I refute it by the simplest reference to fact.
<br/>What I have written remains ; and is readily accessible in any
<br/>of our public libraries. I have had one or two impotent ene-
<br/>mies, and a multitude of cherished friends—and both friends
<br/>and enemies have been, for the most part, literary people;
<br/>vet no man can point to a single critique, among the very
<br/>numerous ones which I have written during the last ten
<br/>years, which is either wholly fault-finding or wholly in ap-
<br/>probation ; nor is there an instance to be discovered, among
<br/>all that I have published, of my having set forth, either in
<br/>praise or censure, a single opinion upon any critical topic of
<br/>moment, without attempting, at least, to give it authority by
<br/>something that wore the semblance of a reason. Now, is
<br/>there a writer in the land, who, having dealt in criticism
<br/>even one-fourth as much as myself, can of his own criticisms,
<br/>conscientiously say the same? The fact is, that very many
<br/>of the most eminent men in America whom I am proud to
<br/>number among the sincerest of my friends, have been ren-
<br/>dered so solely by their approbation of my comments upon
<br/>their own works—comments in great measure directed
<br/>against themselves as authors—belonging altogether to that
<br/>very class of criticism which it is the petty policy of the Ou-
<br/>tises to cry down, with their diminutive voices, as offensive
<br/>on the score of wholesale vituperation and personal abuse.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If, to be brief, in what I have put forth there has been a pre-
<br/>ponderance of censure over commendation,—is there not to
<br/>be imagined for this preponderance a more charitable motive
<br/>than any which the Outises have been magnanimous enough
<br/>to assign me—is not this preponderance, in a word, the na-
<br/>tural and inevitable tendency of all criticism worth the name
<br/>in this age of so universal an authorship, that no man in his
<br/>senses will pretend to deny the vast predominance of good
<br/>writers over bad ?</p>
         <p>"And now," says Outis," [and now too, say I] “ for the matter of
Longfellow's imitations--in what do they consist? The critic is not
very specific in this charge. Of what kind are they? Are they imi-
tations of thought? Why not call them plagiarisms then, and show
them  up? Or are they only verbal imitations of style? Perhaps this
is one of them, in his poem on the "Sea Weed,"
-------------------------------------------------------------"drifting, drifting, drifting,
On the shifting
Currents of the restless main.
resembling in form and collocation only, a line in a beautiful and very
</p>
         <p>powerful poem of Mr. Edgar A. Poe. (Write it rather Edgar a
<br/>Poet, and then it is right to a T.) I have not the poem before me
<br/>and have forgotten its title. But he is describing a magnificent intel-
<br/>lect in ruins, if I remember rightly—and, speaking of the eloquence
<br/>of its better days, represents it as	</p>
         <p>----- “flowing, flowing, flowing,
Like a river.”
</p>
         <p>Is this what the critic means ? Is it such imitations as this that he
<br/>alludes to ? If not, I am at fault, either in my reading of Longfellow,
<br/>or in my general familiarity with the American Poets. If this be the
<br/>kind of imitation referred to, permit me to say, the charge is too pal-
<br/>try for any man, who valued his reputation either as a gentleman or a
<br/>scholar.”</p>
         <p>Elsewhere he says:—
</p>
         <p>Moreover, this poem contains an example of that kind of repetition
<br/>which I have supposed the critic meant to charge upon Longfellow as
<br/>one of his imitations—</p>
         <p>Away—away—away—&amp;c.
</p>
         <p>I might pursue it farther, but I will not. Such criticisms only make
<br/>the author of them contemptible, without soiling a plume in the cap
<br/>of his victim.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first point to be here observed is the complacency
<br/>with which Outis supposes me to make a certain charge and
<br/>then vituperates me for his own absurd supposition. Were
<br/>I, or any man, to accuse Mr. Longfellow of imitation on the
<br/>score of thrice employing a word in consecutive connexion,
<br/>then I, (or any man) would only be guilty of as great a sot-
<br/>ticism as was Outis in accusing me of imitation on the score
<br/>of the refrain. The repetition in question is assuredly not
<br/>claimed by myself as original—I should therefore be wary
<br/>how I charged Mr. Longfellow with imitating it from my-
<br/>self. It is, in fact, a musical effect, which is the common
<br/>property of all mankind, and has been their common proper-
<br/>ty for ages.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless the quotation of this
“drifting, drifting, drifting”
</p>
         <p>is on the part of Outis, a little unfortunate. Most certainly
<br/>the supposed imitation had never been observed by me—nor
<br/>even had I observed it, should I have considered it individu-
<br/>ally, as a point of any moment;—but all will admit, (since
<br/>Outis himself has noticed the parallel,) that, were a second
<br/>parrallel of any obviousness to be established from the same
<br/>brief poem, “The Sea-Weed,” this second would come in
<br/>very strong corroboration of the first. Now, the sixth stanza
<br/>of this very “Sea-Weed” (which was first published in
<br/>“Graham’s Magazine” for January 1845) commences with</p>
         <p>“ From the for off isles enchanted
</p>
         <p>and in a little poem of my own, addressed “ To Mary,” and
<br/>first published at page 636 of the first volume of the “ South-
<br/>ern Literary Messenger,” will be found the lines:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>„ And thus thy memory is to me
<br/>Like some enchanted far off isle
<br/>In some tumultuous sea.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But to show, in general, what I mean by accusing Mr. Long-
<br/>fellow of imitation, I collate his “ Midnight Mass for the Dying
<br/>Year” with " The Death of the Old Year” of Tennyson.</p>
         <p>MIDNIGHT MASS FOR THE DYING YEAR.
Yes, the Year is growing old,
</p>
         <p>And his eve is pale and bleared,
<br/>Death, with frosty hand and cold,
<br/>Plucks the old man by the beard,
<br/>Sorely,—sorely !</p>
         <p>The leaves are falling, falling,
Solemnly and slow;
Caw, caw, the rooks are calling;
It is a sound of woe,
A sound of woe!
</p>
         <p>Through woods and mountain-passes
<br/>The winds, like anthems, roll;
<br/>They are chanting solemn masses,
<br/>Singing, Pray for this poor soul,
<br/>Pray,—pray!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And the hooded clouds, like friars,
<br/>Tell their beads in drops of rain,
<br/>And patter their doleful prayers ;</p>
         <p>Put their prayers are all in vain,
All in vain!
There he stands in the foul weather,
The foolish, fond Old Year,
Crowned with wild flowers and with
heather,
Like weak, despised Lear,
A king,—a king !
Then comes the summer-like day,
Bids the old man rejoice!
His joy! his last! O, the old man
gray,
Loveth her ever soft voice
Gentle and low.
To the crimson woods he saith—
To the voice gentle and low,
Of the soft air like a daughter’s breath,
Pray do not mock me so !
Do not laugh at me !
And now the sweet day is dead ;
Cold in his arms it lies;
No stain from its breath is spread
Over the glassy skies,
No mist nor stain !
Then, too, the Old Year dieth,
And the forests utter a moan,
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page196"/>
Like the voice of one who crieth
In the wilderness alone,
Vex not his ghost!
Then comes, with an awful roar,
Gathering and sounding on,
The storm-wind from Labrador,
The wind Euroclydon,
The storm-wind!
Howl! howl! and from the forest
Sweep the red leaves away !
Would, the sins that thou abhor-
rest,
O soul! could thus decay,
And be swept away !
For there shall come a mightier blast,
There shall be a darker day ;
</p>
         <p>And the stars, from heaven down-cast,
<br/>Like red leaves be swept away !
<br/>Kyrie Eleyson !</p>
         <p>Christie Eleyson !
THE DEATH OF THE OLD YEAR.
Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,
And the winter winds are wearily sighing;
Toll ye the church-bell sad and low,
And tread softly, and speak low,
For the Old Year lies a-dying.
Old Year, you must not die,
You came to us so readily,
You lived with us so steadily.
Old Year, you shall not die.
He lieth still: he doth not move ;
He will not see the dawn of day ;
He hath no other life above—
He gave me a friend, and a true, true love.
And the New Year will take ’em away.
Old Year, you must not go,
So long as you have been with us,
Such joy as you have seen with us,
Old Year, you shall not go.
He frothed his bumpers to the brim;
A jollier year we shall not see ;
But though his eyes are waxing dim,
And though his toes speak ill of him,
He was a friend to me.
Old Year, you shall not die ;
We did so laugh and cry with you,
I’ve half a mind to die with you.
Old Year, if you must die.
He was full of joke and jest,
But all his merry quips are o’er;
To see him die, across the waste
His son and heir doth ride post haste,
But he ’ll be dead before.
Every one for his own ;
The night is starry and cold, my friend,
And the New Year, blithe and bold, my friend,
Comes up to take his own.
How hard he breathes ! Over the snow
I heard just now the crowing cock.
The shadows flicker to and fro :
The cricket chirps : the light bums low:
’Tis nearly one o’clock.
Shake hands before you die ;
Old Year, we ’ll dearly rue for you,
What is it we can do tor you ?
Speak out before you die.
His face is growing sharp and thin—
Alack ! our friend is gone !
Close up his eyes; tie up his chin ;
Step from the corpse and let him in
That standeth there alone,
And waiteth at the door.
There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,
And a new face at the door, my friend,
A new face at the door.
</p>
         <p>I have no idea of commenting, at any length, upon this
<br/>imitation ; which is too palpable to be mistaken ; and which
<br/>belongs to the most barbarous class of literary piracy ; that
<br/>class in which, while the words of the wronged author are
<br/>avoided, his most intangible, and therefore his least defensi-
<br/>ble and least reclaimable properly, is appropriated. Here,
<br/>with the exception of lapses, which, however, speak volumes,
<br/>(such for instance as the use of the capitalized “ Old Year,”
<br/>the general peculiarity of the rhythm, and the absence of
<br/>rhyme at the end of each stanza,) there is nothing of a visi-
<br/>ble or palpable nature by which the source of the American
<br/>poem can be established. But then nearly all that is valuable
<br/>in the piece of Tennyson, is the first conception of personifying
<br/>the Old Year as a dying old man, with the singularly wild
<br/>and fantastic manner in which that conception is carried out.
<br/>Of this conception and of this manner he is robbed. What
<br/>is here not taken from Tennyson, is made up mosaically,
<br/>from the death scene of Cordelia, in “Lear”—to which I re-
<br/>fer the curious reader.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In “ Graham’s Magazine" for February 1843, there appear-
<br/>ed a poem, furnished by Professor Longfellow, entitled “The
<br/>Good George Campbell,” and purporting to be a translation
<br/>from the German of O. L. B. Wolff. In “ Minstrelsy An-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>cient and Modern by William Motherwell, published by John
<br/>Wylie, Glasgow 1827,” is to be found a poem partly compil-
<br/>ed and partly written by Motherwell himself. It is entitled
<br/>“ The Bonnie George Campbell.” I give the two side by
<br/>side:</p>
         <p>MOTHERWELL.
Hie upon Hielands
And low upon Tay,
Bonnie George Campbell
Rade out on a day.
Saddled and bridled
And gallant rade he ;
Hame cam his gude horse,
But never cam he.
Out cam his auld mither
Greeting fu’ sair,
And out cam his bonnie bride
Rivin’ her hair.
Saddled and bridled
And booted rade he ;
Toom harae cam the saddle,
But never cam he.
“My meadow lies green,
And my corn is unshorn;
My barn is too big,
And my baby’s unborn.”
Saddled and bridled
And booted rade he;
Toom hame cam the saddle,
But never cam he.
LONGFELLOW.
High on the Highlands,
And deep in the day,
The good George Campbell
Rode free and away.
All saddled, all bridled,
Gay garments he wore ;
Home came his gude steed,
But he nevermore.
Out came his mother,
Weeping so sadly ;
Out came his beauteous bride
Weeping so madly.
All saddled, all bridled,
Strong armor he wore ;
Home came the saddle,
But he nevermore.
My meadow lies green,
Unreaped is my corn,
My garner is empty,
My child is unborn.
All saddled, all bridled,
Sharp weapons he bore:
Home came the saddle,
But he nevermore!
</p>
         <p>Professor Longfellow defends himself (I learn) from the
<br/>charge of imitation in this case, by the assertion that he did
<br/>translate from Wolff, but that Wolff copied from Motherwell.
<br/>I am willing to believe almost anything rather than so gross
<br/>a plagiarism as this seems to be—but there are difficulties
<br/>which should be cleared up. In the first place how happens
<br/>it that, in the transmission from the Scotch into the German,
<br/>and again from the German into the English, not only the
<br/>versification should have been rigidly preserved, but the
<br/>rhymes, and alliterations ? Again ; how are we to imagine
<br/>that Mr. Longfellow with his known intimate acquaintance
<br/>with “ Motherwell’s Minstrelsy” did not at once recognize so
<br/>remarkable a poem when he met it in Wolff? I have now
<br/>before me a large volume of songs, ballads, etc. collected by
<br/>Wolff; but there is here no such poem—and, to be sure, it.
<br/>should not be sought in such a collection. No collection of
<br/>his own poems has been published, and the piece of which
<br/>we are in search must be fugitive—unless, indeed, it is in-
<br/>cluded in a volume of translations from various tongues, of
<br/>which O. L. B. Wolff is also the author—but of which I am
<br/>! unable to obtain a copy.* It is by no means improbable that
<br/>here the poem in question is to be found—but in this case it
<br/>must have been plainly acknowledged as a translation, with
<br/>its original designated. How, then, could Professor Long-
<br/>fellow have translated it as original with Wolff? These
<br/>are mysteries yet to be solved. It is observable—peculiarly
<br/>! so—that the Scotch “ Toom” is left untranslated in the ver-
<br/>sion of Graham’s Magazine. Will it be found that the same
<br/>omission occurs in Wolff’s version ?</p>
         <p>In “ The Spanish Student” of Mr. Longfellow, at page 80,
will be found what follows:
</p>
         <p>Scene IV.—Preciosa's chamber. She is sitting with a book in her hand
<br/>near a table, on which are flowers. A bird singing in its cage. The
<br/>Count of Lara enters behind, unperceived.</p>
         <p>Preciosa reads.
All are sleeping, weary heart!
Thou, thou only sleepless art!
Heigho ! I wish Victorian were here.
I know not what it is makes me so restless! [The bird sings.
Thou little prisoner with thy motley coat,
That from thy vaulted, wiry dungeon singest,
Like thee I am a captive, and, like thee,
I have a gentle gaoler. Lack-a-day !
All are sleeping, weary heart !
Thou, thou only sleepless art !
All this throbbing, all thia aching,
Evermore shall keep thee waking,
For a heart in sorrow breaking
Thinketh ever of its smart !
</p>
         <p>Thou speakest truly, poet! and methinks
<br/>More hearts are breaking in this world of ours
<br/>Than one would say. In distant villages
<br/>And solitudes remote, where winds nave wafted
<br/>The barbed seeds of love, or birds of passage
<br/>Scattered them in their flight, do they take root,</p>
         <p/>

And grow in silence, and in silence perish.
Who hears the falling of the forest leaf?
Or who takes note of every flower that dies ?
Heigho ! I wish Victorian would come.
Dolores! [ Turns to lay down her book, and perceives the Count.
Ha!
Lara. Senora, pardon me.
Preciosa. How’s this? Dolores!
Lara.	Pardon me—
Preciosa.	Dolores!
Lara. Be not alarmed ; I found no one in waiting.
If I have been too bold----
Preciosa [turning her back upon him]. You are too bold !
Retire ! retire, and leave me !
Lara.	My dear lady,
First hear me ! I beseech you, let me speak !
'Tis for your good I come.
Preciosa [turning toward him with indignation].
Begone ! Begone i
</p>
         <p>You are the Count of Lara, but your deeds
<br/>Would make the statues of your ancestors
<br/>Blush on their tombs ! Is it Castilian honor,</p>
         <p>Is it Castilian pride, to steal in here
Upon a friendless girl, to do her wrong?
O	shame ! shame ! shame ! that you, a nobleman,
Should be so little noble iu your thoughts
As to send jewels here to win my love,
And think to buy my honor with your gold I
1	have no words to tell you how I scorn you.
Begonel The sight of you is hateful to me!
Begone, I say!
</p>
         <p>A few passages farther on in the same scene we meet the
<br/>following stage directions:—“He tries to embrace her, she
<br/>starts back and draws a dagger from her bosom." A little
<br/>farther still and “ Victorian enters behind.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Compare all this with a " Scene from Politian, an unpub-
<br/>lished Tragedy by Edgar A. Poe,” to be found either at page
<br/>13, or at page 106, of the second volume of the “ Southern
<br/>Literary Messenger.”</p>
         <p>The scene opens with the following stage directions:
</p>
         <p>A lady's apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden.
<br/>Lalage in deep mourning, reading at a table, on which lie some
<br/>books and a hand mirror. In the back ground, Jacinta leans
<br/>carelessly on the back of a chair.</p>
         <p>Lalage reading. " It in another climate, so he said,
Bore a bright golden flower but not i’ this soil.
[Pauses, turns over some leaves, and then resumes.
No ling’ring winters there, nor snow, nor shower,
But ocean ever, to refresh mankind,
Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”
Oh, beautiful! most beautiful! how like
To what my fever’d soul doth dream of Heaven !
O happy land ! [pauses] She died—the maiden died—
O still more happy maiden who couldst die !
Jacinta!
[Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes.
Again a similar tale,
Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
Thus speaketh one Ferdinand i' the words of the play,
** She died full young”—one Bossola answers him
u I think not so ; her infelicity
Seemed to have years too many.” Ah luckless lady !
Jacinta!  [Siill no answer.] Here’s a far sterner story,
But like, on very like in its despair,—
Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
A thousand hearts, losing at length her own.
</p>
         <p>She died. Thus endeth the history, and her maids
<br/>Lean over her and weep—two gentle maids
<br/>With gentle names, Eiros and Charmion.</p>
         <p>Rainbow and Dove—Jacinta!
</p>
         <p>[Jacinta finally in a discussion about certain jewels, insults
<br/>her mistress, who bursts into tears.
<br/>Lalage. Poor Lalage ! and is it come to this?</p>
         <p>Thy servant maid !---but courage !—’tis but a viper
Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul !
[ Taking up the mirror.
Ha ! here at least’s a friend—too much a friend
Iu earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.
Fair mirror and true ! now tell me, for thou canst,
A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not
Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
It sneaks of sunkeu eyes, and wasted cheeks,
And beauty long deceased—remembers me
Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope
Inurned and entombed !—now, in a tone
Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible
Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
For ruined maid. Fair mirror aud true ! thou liest not.
Thou hast no end to gain—no heart to break.
Castiglione lied who said he loved—
Thou true—he false !—false !—false !
[ While she speaks a Monk enters her apartment, and approach-
es unobserved.
Monk.	Refuge thou hast
Sweet daughter ! in Heaven. Think of eternal things !
Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray.
Lalage. I cannot pray!-- soul is at war with God !
[Arising hurriedly.
The frightful sounds of merriment below
Disturb my senses—go, I cannot pray !
The sweet airs from the garden worry me !
</p>
         <p>Thy presence grieves me—go !—thy priestly raiment
<br/>Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix
<br/>With horror and awe !</p>
         <p>Monk.	Think of thy precious soul!
</p>
         <p>Lalage. Think of my early days !—think of my father
<br/>And mother in Heaven ! think of our quiet home
<br/>And the rivulet that ran before the door !</p>
         <p>Think of my little sisters l—think of them !
</p>
         <p>And think of me !—think of my trusting love
<br/>And confidence—his vows—iny ruin—think—think
<br/>Of my unspeakable misery !—begone !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Yet stay ! yet stay ! what was it thou saidst of prayer
<br/>And penitence ? Didst thou not speak of faith
<br/>And vows before the throne ?</p>
         <p>Monk.	I did.
Lalage.	’Tis well.
There is a vow were fitting should be made—
A sacred vow, imperative, and urgentt—
A solemn vow.
Monk.	Daughter, this zeal is well.
J.alage. Father ! this zeal is any thing but well.
Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing ?
A crucifix whereon to register
A pious vow ? 	[He hands her his own.
Not that—oh ! no !—no ! no ! [Shuddering.
Not that ! not that ! I tell thee, holy man,
Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me :
Stand back! I have a crucifix myself—
I have a crucifix ! Methinks ’twere fitting
The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—
And the deed’s register should tally, father !
Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
Is written in Heaven !
[Draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high.
Monk.	Thy words are madness, daughter !
And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—
Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine—
Pause ere too late !—oh ! be not—be not rash !
Swear not the oath—oh ! swear it not!
Lalage.	’Tis sworn!
The coincidences here are too markedly peculiar to be
gainsayed. The sitting at the table with books, etc.—the
flowers on the one hand, and the garden on the other_________the
</p>
         <p>presence of the pert maid—the reading aloud from the book
<br/>—the pausing and commenting—the plaintiveness of what
<br/>is read, in accordance with the sorrow of the reader—the ab-
<br/>straction—the frequent calling of the maid by name—the re-
<br/>fusal of the maid to answer—the jewels—the “ begone”—the
<br/>unseen entrance of a third person from behind—and the draw-
<br/>ing of the dagger—are points sufficiently noticeable to estab-
<br/>lish at least the imitation beyond all doubt.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Let us now compare the concluding lines of Mr. Longfel-
<br/>low’s “ Autumn” with that of Mr. Bryant’s “ Thanatopsis:”
<br/>Mr. B. has it thus:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>So live, that when thy summons comes to join
<br/>The innumerable caravan that moves
<br/>To that mysterious realm where each shall take
<br/>His chamber in the silent halls of Death,</p>
         <p>Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon ; but, sustained and soothed]
</p>
         <p>By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
<br/>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
<br/>About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.</p>
         <p>Mr. L. thus:
To him the wind, aye and the yellow leaves
Shall have a voice and give him eloquent teachings.
</p>
         <p>He shall so hear the solemn hymn that Death
<br/>Has lilted up for all, that he shall go
<br/>To his long resting-place without a tear.</p>
         <p>Again, in his “Prelude to the Voices of the Night” Mr.
Longfellow says:—
Look then into thine heart and write !
Sir Philip Sidney in the “ Astrophel and Stella” has:
Foole, said my Muse to me, looke in thy heart und write !
Again—in Longfellow’s “ Midnight Mass” we read:
And the hooded clouds like friars.
The Lady in Milton’s “ Comus” says:
When the grey-hooded even
Like a sad votarist in palmer’s weeds.
And again:—these lines by Professor Longfellow will be
remembered by every body:
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page198"/>
Art is long and time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Still like muffled drums are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.
</p>
         <p>But if any one will turn to page 66 of John Sharpe’s edition
<br/>of Henry Headley’s Select Beauties of Ancient English Poe-
<br/>try, published at London in 1810, he will there find an Exe-
<br/>quy on the death of his wife by Henry King, Bishop of Chi-
<br/>chester, and therein also the following lines, where the author
<br/>is speaking of following his wife to the grave :</p>
         <p>But hark ! my pulse, like a soft drum,
Beats my approach—tells thee I come !
And slow howe’er my marches be,
I shall at last sit down by thee.
</p>
         <p>Were I disposed indeed, to push this subject any farther,
<br/>I should have little difficulty in culling, from the works of
<br/>the author of “ Outre Mer,” a score or two of imitations
<br/>quite as palpable as any upon which I have insisted. The
<br/>fact of the matter is, that the friends of Mr. Longfellow,
<br/>so far from undertaking to talk about my “ carping littleness”
<br/>in charging Mr. Longfellow with imitation, should have
<br/>given me credit, under the circumstances, for great modera-
<br/>tion, in charging him with imitation alone. Had I accused
<br/>him, in loud terms, of manifest and continuous plagiarism,
<br/>I should but have echoed the sentiment of every man of let-
<br/>ters in the land beyond the immediate influence of the Long-
<br/>fellow coterie. And since I, “ knowing what I know and
<br/>seeing what I have seen”—submitting in my own person to
<br/>accusations of plagiarism for the very sins of this gentleman
<br/>against myself—since I contented myself, nevertheless, with
<br/>simply setting forth the merits of the poet in the strongest
<br/>light, whenever an opportunity was afforded me, can it be
<br/>considered either decorous or equitable on the part of Profes-
<br/>sor Longfellow to beset me, upon my first adventuring an in-
<br/>finitesimal sentence of dispraise, with ridiculous anonymous
<br/>letters from his friends, and moreover, with malice prepense,
<br/>to instigate against me the pretty little witch entitled Miss
<br/>Walter; advising her and instructing her to pierce me to
<br/>death with the needles of innumerable epigrams, rendered
<br/>unnecessarily and therefore cruelly painful to my feelings by
<br/>being first carefully deprived of the point ?</p>
         <p>E. A. P.
A COMMISSION OF LUNACY.
</p>
         <p>I was once called to decide upon the case of a person who
<br/>was thought by his friends to be insane. He had been sent
<br/>to a mad house, and in one of his lucid intervals had de-
<br/>manded a trial of the county judge, and a trial was granted.
<br/>A jury of six men, of whom I was one, were to decide upon
<br/>his case. He was a healthy looking gentleman, with no-
<br/>thing unusual in his appearance excepting a restlessness of
<br/>his eyes, which might not have been observed had he not
<br/>been accused of insanity. The proofs of his madness were
<br/>very clear, but he showed so much coolness and clear think-
<br/>ing in his cross-questioning of witnesses, that I felt some
<br/>hesitation in pronouncing him unsound of mind. His case
<br/>was a very sad one, and he melted the hearts of all who
<br/>heard him when he appealed to the jury.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ I deny that I am insane, gentlemen,” he said, when the
<br/>judge gave him leave to speak, “ but that is a matter of course.
<br/>No man ever thought himself insane; neither can any man
<br/>ever think himself so; for, having no standard of soundness
<br/>but what exists in his own mind, he cannot be unsound to
<br/>himself though he may be manifestly so in the mind of ano-
<br/>ther. But who shall determine what is madness and what
<br/>is not ? Be careful, gentlemen, how you pronounce me mad,
<br/>lest to-morrow I be called to pronounce you so. The proofs</p>
         <p/>
         <p>that have been offered to you of my madness are to me proofs
<br/>of entire soundness of mind. I would be mad were I any-
<br/>thing different from what I have been represented. They
<br/>have brought three physicians, who all say that I am mad.
<br/>Yet I will compel you to admit that the madness is in them
<br/>and not in me. I was sick, very sick, sick at heart, for you
<br/>must know that I had lost my Bessy and my little boy, my
<br/>little boy.” Here the unfortunate hesitated and seemed to
<br/>lose himself entirely. “ I said that I was sick, but it was
<br/>Bessy. But it must have been me. Yes, I was sick, very
<br/>sick, sick at heart, for my little boy and Bessy. Bessy again.
<br/>Yes, Bessy had been sick but now it was I. I was sick, and
<br/>they brought me a physician. He felt my pulse, he looked
<br/>upon me with his cold gray eyes, and then reached me a
<br/>tumbler half full of a nauseous liquid which he said would
<br/>quiet me, and do me good. But all the while I was quieter
<br/>than a rock, and colder, and harder. I thought that he
<br/>needed the stuff more than myself, so I caught his head be-
<br/>tween my knees, and though he struggled hard yet I poured
<br/>it down his throat, gentlemen, and he was glad enough to es-
<br/>cape. Then they brought another to me, who gave me a
<br/>little globule of sugar, a pin’s head was a cannon ball beside
<br/>it, and told me that it would cure my fever. Do you blame
<br/>me for thrusting the madman out of my chamber ? Then they
<br/>brought me another, who would give me no medicine at all,
<br/>but ordered them to swathe me in wet sheets. Him too I
<br/>drove from my presence, the lunatic. Yet these are the men
<br/>who come here to swear to my insanity. Ah, gentlemen, I
<br/>am not mad, but I wonder that I am not. The combined
<br/>powers have taken away my Bessy and my little boy, and I
<br/>shall never, never, never see them more. Never.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was a perfectly clear case of lunacy, and a pitiable one.
<br/>But when we retired to the jury-room, one of the jurors
<br/>would not agree with the other five. He stretched himself
<br/>upon a bench, threw a handkerchief over his head, and re-
<br/>quested us to wake him when we had come over to his way
<br/>of thinking. For myself, I was not disposed to be bullied
<br/>out of my opinion, so I too lay down upon a bench, deter-
<br/>mined not to yield an inch of my right to think for myself,
<br/>and in a few minutes fell fast asleep ; but I had better have
<br/>kept awake, for the moment that my eyelids fell I had to
<br/>perform the part of a juror again.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was the same ill-lighted room, the same dull judge who
<br/>slept through half the trial, the same clownish spectators,
<br/>the same everything, except the defendant, who yet seemed
<br/>to be the same person in a different habit.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He was a good looking youth, indeed, I had never seen a
<br/>finer; his dark chesnut hair and sandy beard were equal to
<br/>a patent of nobility, for they proclaimed his Saxon blood,
<br/>and proved him of a race that came upon the earth to conquer
<br/>it. His eyes were grey and his complexion fair. But, poor man!
<br/>he was out of his mind. His father was a merchant, and he
<br/>wept while he gave evidence to his son’s insanity. He, the
<br/>son, would wear his beard, and this was the proof of his
<br/>madness. In spite of the jeers, the sneers, and the laughter
<br/>of the world, he would let his beard grow as nature inten-
<br/>ded. Poor fellow! We all pitied him. So intelligent, so
<br/>gentle in his manners, so happily circumstanced, and yet
<br/>mad ! He had the hardihood to declare in open court, that
<br/>he saw no reason why he should deprive his face of the co-
<br/>vering which God had put upon it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>"No reason!” cried his mother, “ O my son, does not your
<br/>father shave, your uncle, your brother, all the world shave
<br/>but yourself? No reason for shaving ? O! my son !”</p>
         <p>“ True,” replied the unfortunate youth as he stroked his
beard with ineffable content, “ true, but they are all mad or
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page199"/>
         </p>
         <p>they would not. I need my beard to protect my face and
<br/>throat from the wet and cold. It helps to hide the sharp
<br/>angles of my jaws, it makes me more comely, adds to my
<br/>strength and keeps me in health. Do I not look more like a
<br/>man than my father, with his smooth, pale face, who has no-
<br/>thing but his clothes to distinguish him from a woman ?
<br/>Look at him, he has scraped all the hair off' his chin and
<br/>placed another man’s hair on his head. Beautiful consisten-
<br/>cy. To shave his chin and put false hair on his head! What
<br/>a mad outrage upon nature. Hair is not always necessary to
<br/>the head for it often falls off as we grow old, but it never
<br/>drops from the chin. I appeal to this honorable court—”</p>
         <p>“ Silence !” cried the honorable court, who at that moment
woke up.
“ Justice never sleeps, excepting on the bench,” observed
the youth in a low voice.
</p>
         <p>“ Go on,” said the honorable court, whose business, when
<br/>out of court, was horse dealing, which fitted him in an emi-
<br/>nent degree for the responsibilities of his office.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“I appeal to this honorable court,” continued the insane
<br/>youth, “ I appeal to you, gentlemen of the jury, and I would,
<br/>if 1 were permitted, appeal to these fair ladies (there were
<br/>several old gossips in the room) to say whether I am not
<br/>more sane than my father.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ I can’t allow such audacious remarks as those in this
<br/>place,” said the honorable court, rising and wiping its hon-
<br/>orable face with a dingy handkerchief. “ This thing mustn't
<br/>proceed no further. 1 don’t know, gentlemen of the jury,
<br/>as I have ever been more seriously affected in my life, than
<br/>I have been by this melancholy trial.”</p>
         <p>“ Probaby not,” said the maniac.
</p>
         <p>“ The court will allow no interruption from no one,” said
<br/>the honorable court, fixing its dreadfully stern eyes on the
<br/>madman and stretching out its stumpy fore-finger in a threat-
<br/>ening manner. “ My heart has been melted by the scene we
<br/>have witnessed.”	</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ A very little heat will melt ice,” said the mad youth.
<br/>“My feelings is too much for me to proceed,” continued
<br/>the honorable court, “ I resign the case into your hands,
<br/>gentlemen of the jury, only remarking that the young man is
<br/>mad, and so you must give in your werdick.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The poor youth was immediately put into a strait-jacket
<br/>and dragged away, yet he still seemed to stand at the bar,
<br/>but his appearance was changed. He wore a broad brim-
<br/>med hat made of oaten straw, a linen blouse which reached
<br/>below his knees, and a shirt of snowy whiteness open at the
<br/>throat, so that his manly neck was fully exposed. His com-
<br/>plexion was brown, his eye clear and bright, his laughing
<br/>mouth displayed teeth of a pearly lustre, and he appeared to
<br/>receive great pleasure in snuffing the fragrance of a bunch of
<br/>field flowers which he held in his hand. I thought, as I look-
<br/>ed at him, that I had never seen a youth who bore so many
<br/>marks of unequivocal soundness of mind and body. But he
<br/>was mad, notwithstanding all. His own father was the first
<br/>witness examined. Poor old man ! he could hardly articu-
<br/>late the words which a sense of duty to his child compelled
<br/>him to utter.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Nothing but a hope that judicious medical treatment
<br/>may restore my son to his senses, could induce me to this
<br/>dreadful alternative,” said the old man after he had been
<br/>sworn. “ My poor son has been afflicted with his disorder
<br/>for two years. We have tried all gentle means to cure him,
<br/>but he grows worse and worse. The proofs of his madness
<br/>are so glaring that he cannot be kept from the mad-house.
<br/>He is now in his twenty-fifth year; he has had a good educa-
<br/>tion, the best that money could procure; he has made the
<br/>tour of Europe ; he has had all the advantages which my ex-
<br/>tensive business connexions could give him, and yet, gentle-
<br/>men, regardless of my wishes and his own welfare, he has
<br/>married a poor young woman and gone to bury his splendid
<br/>accomplishments on a farm. Is it not dreadful, gentlemen,
<br/>to witness such a sacrifice ? I offered him a share in my
<br/>business, I proposed to establish him in a splendid distillery,
<br/>but such was the poor creature's derangement of intellect that
<br/>even this brilliant offer could not draw him from the obscuri-
<br/>ty of the country. Look at his dress, gentlemen ; if the court,
<br/>please, is not that prima facie evidence of his insanity ?"
<br/>The court thought it was, but would not give a decided</p>
         <p>opinion without first looking into somebody’s reports.
</p>
         <p>“ Look at him, gentlemen, would any body believe that he
<br/>was the son of a rich merchant ? That disgraceful blouse
<br/>like a common laborer’s. That coarse straw hat! O, gen-
<br/>men, pardon a father’s weakness ! I can say no more.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The mother of the insane man appeared next, but her dis-
<br/>tress was too great to admit of her giving her evidence in a
<br/>straight forward manner.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>She believed her son to be crazy. Had first suspected
<br/>it on his return from Paris on account of his plain clothes ; he
<br/>had left off coffee and tea and drank nothing but cold water;
<br/>he talked strangely about the country; quite unlike her
<br/>other children, who were fond of style and lived respectably ;
<br/>insanity not peculiar to the family ; was not influenced by
<br/>her husband; had seen her son laugh with the coachman ;
<br/>had opposed his marriage; thought it a decided proof of in-
<br/>sanity to marry out of one’s own circle ; had been the first
<br/>to propose sending her son to the insane retreat.</p>
         <p>After the witnesses delivered their testimony, the court
told the maniac that he might address the jury.
</p>
         <p>“ I have nothing to say in regard to the testimony,” said
<br/>the youth, “ but that it is all true. I prefer the sweets of a
<br/>country life to the bitter toils of business. I have a wife
<br/>whom I love ; she brought me no fortune, it is true, but she
<br/>helps me, daily, to earn one. I have a little farm which
<br/>yields more than I need; I have good health, a quiet con-
<br/>science, and two lovely children whose minds and bodies I
<br/>am striving to rear in conformity with the dictates of nature.
<br/>For these I prefer a moderate fortune in the country to an
<br/>immodedrate one in the city. Besides, I look upon the judg-
<br/>ment pronounced upon Adam in the light of a command, and
<br/>I was never happy until the sweat of my own brow seasoned
<br/>my daily food.”</p>
         <p>The jury pronounced him mad without leaving their seats.
“ A righteous werdick!” said the honorable court.
He was led from the court-room, and yet he still stood
there, such are the inconsistencies of dreams.
</p>
         <p>He was now dressed in rusty clothes; his countenance was
<br/>subdued by thought; he was unhappy but not uneasy ; his
<br/>eyes were cast down, his lips were more closely pressed to-
<br/>gether, and the vigorous look of youth was changed for a
<br/>gravity of demeanor that sat upon him well, though it seem-
<br/>ed too grave for his years. There was literally a cloud of
<br/>witnesses to his insanity. He had been heard to pity a con-
<br/>demned felon ; he had said irreverend things of the law; he
<br/>had spoken against the clergy; he had abused physic;
<br/>he had given his money to vagabonds; he laughed at the
<br/>fashions; he had cried at a wedding; he was opposed to war;
<br/>he had been struck without returning the blow ; he had piti-
<br/>ed a slave holder ; he had——. But the jury would hear no
<br/>more. They pronounced him mad with one voice. All Bed-
<br/>lam seemed now broken loose. No sooner was one maniac
<br/>pronounced upon than another occupied the stand. The ob-
<br/>scure little court-room began to look like the ante-room of
<br/>the revolutionary tribunal. To expedite business a whole lot
<br/>of maniacs were put up together and judged in a lump.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>One was a young girl of eighteen who had married her
<br/>father’s poor clerk whom she loved, when she might have
<br/>married her father’s rich partner whose money her friends
<br/>loved ; a Wall-street broker who had refused usury on a note ;
<br/>a grocer who had recommended a customer not to buy his
<br/>sugar because he could buy cheaper elsewhere ; a man who
<br/>corrected a post office error when his letter had been under-
<br/>charged; a political orator who had refused an office because
<br/>he did not think himself entitled to one ; a lawyer who re-
<br/>fused to advocate the cause of a rogue on the pretence of
<br/>conscientious scruples ; a critic who doubted his own infal-
<br/>libility; a lieutenant of marines who gave up his commission
<br/>and earned his bread by his own labor; an editor of a news-
<br/>paper who had never called names; an English traveller
<br/>without national prejudices; a midshipman who never
<br/>damned the service; an artist who painted from nature; an
<br/>author who was satisfied with a review of his book; a young
<br/>lady who was offended at being told that she was pretty ;
<br/>a poet who considered himself inferior to Shakspeare. These
<br/>were all pronounced mad. But the noise of their removal
<br/>woke me, and finding that the other jurors had gone over to
<br/>the one who was for rendering a verdict of not insane, I too,
<br/>instructed by my dream, concluded to coincide with them,
<br/>lest I should establish a precedent by which I might at some
<br/>future day be pronounced mad myself.</p>

PORTRAIT OF AN ANNEXATIONIST.
</p>
         <p>It has not been for lack of interest, or of opinion, that we have kept silent on the important subject of annexation. But
<br/>seeing that the thing was determined upon, we saw no good in wasting our little space in the reading world by fretting
<br/>and fuming to no purpose. The deed has been done, and the whole country has been standing with open mouth ever since
<br/>it was done, waiting to see how it would affect the various powers,—England, France, and Mexico; but no intelligence has
<br/>yet been had from either. There is one great power, however, a crowned head, of whom nobody seems to have had a
<br/>thought, who has felt more interest in the matter than any other potentate, and from whom we have heard by mesmeric ex-
<br/>press. To him the news of the joint resolutions came like a cool wind in summer, bracing up his nerves and giving him a
<br/>sensation of ineffable satisfaction. His imperial majesty, Satan the first, received the intelligence with unbounded and in-
<br/>expressible delight, inexpressible at least in words. To give the public some idea of his content, our artist has furnished us
<br/>with a fac simile of his serene highness as he appeared while listening to the joint resolutions which were read to him, by
<br/>his private Secretary, with all their amendments.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The likeness is indisputable, and the satisfaction immense; though commonly of a lean habit, it will be seen that he
<br/>has grown fat upon it; his fancy is tickled to a degree past bearing, with visions of prospective fields of carnage, of an ex-
<br/>tended area of--------Freedom; of battles by sea; of captives in prison; of broken-hearted widows; of weeping orphans;</p>
         <p/>
         <p>of national debts ; of privateers ; of pirates; of burning villages; sinking ships ; heroes; chieftains; gold lace ; epaulettes,
<br/>cripples, drunkards, idlers, ruined cities, and innumerable other delights which he feels sure will follow on the heels of annex-
<br/>ation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But, hold! The intended annexees refuse to be annexed. His majesty is more displeased than any holder of scrip ; he
<br/>fumes and scolds ; he drives even his favorites from him in his wrath. It is not to be wondered at; he has not had a taste of
<br/>his favorite pastime, war, in so long a time, that he cannot quietly pocket a disappoinment like this. Our artist has
<br/>sketched him again ; but he looks like another personage though he is the same.</p>
         <p>He has put on his crown of iron horns to give intensity to his anger. He will play the-------with those foolish annexees
who will not accept the terms of denationalization which have been offered to them. But his majesty will again be satisfied :
there is little doubt of the work being done to his mind by and by.

THE ART OF THE USE OF COLOR IN IMITATION IN PAINTING,
NO. VI.
REYNOLDS, ALSTON, STUART.
</p>
         <p>To the method recommended by me in an earlier article,
<br/>for painting a head, I propose now to add another hint, which
<br/>I think will not be lost, the more so as I shall be able to
<br/>bring authority, besides its own self-evident truth.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In the picture, such as it was when we left it some weeks
<br/>back, perhaps some greater purity of complexion might be
<br/>desired ; if so, take a very little white in your brush together
<br/>with drying oil, and scumble it thinly over all your flesh, and
<br/>if the reds were of sufficient strength to bear this slight
<br/>weakening, it will be as pure as a white lily. This comes
<br/>naturally after what I have said of this mode, and perfectly
<br/>harmonises with it; where this has been done, should it not
<br/>answer the expectations or wishes of the painter, let him
<br/>begin it all over again, and do it more thoroughly from the
<br/>beginning; and the end will not disappoint him if he be rea-
<br/>sonable. If there is any thing in it, it cannot be perfected at
<br/>one trial, but should not, therefore, discourage those who have
<br/>for years, it may be, made vain efforts to satisfy themselves by
<br/>the ordinary means.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A gentleman of Boston, who was well acquainted with
<br/>Gilbert Stuart, was invited by him to look at a picture,
<br/>which he had just finished, and whilst they were looking at
<br/>it, Mr. S. told my informant, as something worth knowing,
<br/>“ that a wonderful effect could sometimes be produced in
<br/>flesh by passing white all over it.” But this was all—there
<br/>seemed to have been no system, or thorough knowledge of the
<br/>principle, so as to make any thing certain of it, so far as he
<br/>disclosed it. And, indeed, his pictures sufficiently testify to
<br/>the truth of this supposition—for though his heads of aged
<br/>persons, particularly old men with ruddy-veined complexions,
<br/>are often as fine as could be desired, it is a well-known fact,
<br/>that those of young women of delicate color, or children, are
<br/>greatly inferior, bearing no comparison with the former;
<br/>whereas, had he been thoroughly grounded in this mode,
<br/>there would have been no disparity in his more careful pic-
<br/>tures, at least not in favor of the coarser subject, but rather,
<br/>on the other hand. But if a general principle for the paint-
<br/>ing of flesh be a true one, and such as is to be depended upon,
<br/>it will meet all cases, and be as applicable to the one as the
<br/>other.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Reynolds, too, in some notes of his written for the guidance
<br/>of his pupils, and now to be found in Taylor’s translation of
<br/>Mérimée, on Oil Painting, [page 334,] says:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ In respect to painting the flesh tints, after it has been finished
<br/>with very strong colors, pass white over it very thin with oil. I be-
<br/>lieve it will have a very wonderful effect”—“ or paint carnation too
<br/>red, and then scumble over it with white and black.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This, too, shows how indefinite his knowledge of the cause
<br/>must have been, for it is evident from some of his works that
<br/>I have inspected, that he did not so build up his picture from
<br/>dark to light as I have described.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In a portrait of Charles Carroll, painted by Sir Joshua,
<br/>when our revolutionary hero was a young man, it had been
<br/>reduced by time to a state of the first painting, having been
<br/>thickly impasted with white lead, and the shadows laid
<br/>in gray and solid—the glazings, most likely, of carmine
<br/>and lake, had entirely flown, except in inconsiderable
<br/>streaks here and there; and these washes of fleeting colors
<br/>were probably all that he depended on for his imitations of
<br/>nature. His methods must have been various, throughout
<br/>his life, for some of his pictures are said to retain all their
<br/>color; but he never arrived at what he considered the true
<br/>way, or he would certainly have continued to use it, and he</p>
         <p>is known to have kept changing, to the end of his life, seeking
what he could not find.
</p>
         <p>More than six years since, in conversation with the late
<br/>Washington Alston, I took occasion to speak to him in gene-
<br/>ral terms of this theory of the use of colors, which then, as
<br/>now, interested me very much; he said, that in theory it
<br/>seemed very clear and satisfactory, and admitted that in his
<br/>younger days, twenty or thirty years before, he had himself
<br/>made many experiments of a somewhat similar kind, and did
<br/>not doubt but that it would be as good in practice as in
<br/>thought, if it could be carried out; but he had his doubts
<br/>that light colors so passed over darker ones, as I have de-
<br/>scribed, “ would have the look of a white veil.” The con-
<br/>versation was never renewed, and as I was then too modest
<br/>to point to any of my own pictures where I had made a feeble
<br/>attempt to do the thing I preached, and was not then aware
<br/>of what I have given above in favor of passing white over
<br/>the surface of flesh, from Reynolds or Stuart, I had nothing
<br/>to offer in defence but the simple question, “ well, is not the
<br/>skin actually in some degree a veil ?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Now I have heard it argued by some persons, who doubt
<br/>every thing when they first hear it, “if this theory is true,
<br/>why did not Alston know it ? and Stuart ?” and so they reject
<br/>it;—“ can any thing be more absurd ?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>With great respect for the memory of Mr. Alston, and ad-
<br/>miration for many of his works, yet I cannot bv any means
<br/>subscribe to their perfection in color, particularly his latter;
<br/>the best color that I have ever seen of his, must have been
<br/>produced at least twenty years before, and perhaps when he
<br/>was yet endeavoring to attain the right way. Many seem to
<br/>think that the works of Titian are scarcely finer in color than
<br/>those of Alston ; if so, I have greatly overrated the works of
<br/>the former master, and should never despair of the genius of
<br/>our people in renewing the old Venetian glory. The pictures
<br/>of Alston are low in tone, which to my mind constitutes their
<br/>chiefest merit so far as their coloring is concerned ; hut to
<br/>look upon this as his chief excellence does him great injus-
<br/>tice. It is the delicacy of his taste in design for which he
<br/>must be wisely distinguished. I do not mean to be under-
<br/>stood to say that he had not also a fine eye for color, but that,
<br/>considered as imitations of nature, his flesh wants depth, as
<br/>well as clearness or transparency, being often foxy—and
<br/>when cool, having something of leaden solidity.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If I have offended any one of the innumerable admirers of
<br/>this most distinguished painter by these remarks, let them
<br/>believe, which is true, that I would much rather have left un-
<br/>said any unfavorable word of his pictures, than have utterred
<br/>one syllable which I did not most conscientiously believe.
<br/>Moreover, people are so disposed, when they have once set
<br/>up their idol, to attribute to it not only all the knowledge they
<br/>themselves possess, but all they have not, that to have said
<br/>at least as much as this seemed to me a duty. If he had not
<br/>the knowledge of the best means of using his materials, as I
<br/>am quite certain he had not, the fact that thus crippled he
<br/>has done so much better than others, only argues his more
<br/>extraordinary abilities, and it would not be detracting too
<br/>much from any mere man, to say that there are some things
<br/>that he does not know. I could find it in my heart to say
<br/>that even Raffaelle was ignorant on some points where the
<br/>whole strength of others was to be found. No one, I believe,
<br/>has ever attributed to him what is known to have been well
<br/>understood by Paul Veronese, and others of his school.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To any one acquainted with Alston’s method of painting,
<br/>it will be apparent that he more nearly approached that which
<br/>I have endeavored to set forth, than most of the other pain-
<br/>ters about. He alternated the three primitive colors all through</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page202"/>
         </p>
         <p>his flesh, solidly to he sure, and on the surface instead of
<br/>laying them over each other, and often mixed them all to-
<br/>gether, producing a sort of neutral olive tint, and passed this
<br/>mixture thinly over all his masses, for unity, and again
<br/>touched into this with red yellow and blue; but reason will
<br/>teach us that this is but a small approach to the system of
<br/>Nature, and had it been so used by Titian, it might very
<br/>safely be doubted—no name being a sufficient authority for
<br/>what reason rejects as inconsistent with its teachings, at
<br/>least if we except Revelation ; and an ingenious painter may
<br/>so use a wrong method, like a skillful lawyer making the
<br/>worse appear the better side, that it will need a jury of more
<br/>than ordinary penetration to detect the error.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As to light passed over a darker color “ appearing like a
<br/>veil,” as supposed by Mr. A., what Reynolds says in its favor,
<br/>will be deemed a fair offset.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Most of the better of our painters who have travelled
<br/>abroad, and copied from the pictures of this greatest of all
<br/>colorists, (Titian) agree that where they had done their best
<br/>to imitate them, an impenetrable mystery seemed to hang
<br/>over his flesh that nothing but nature could parallel—look-
<br/>ing, as I have heard it somewhat coarsely expressed, “as if
<br/>it could sweat." When any of Alston’s pictures call forth
<br/>such significant remarks from those who contemplate them,
<br/>it may be time to doubt our eyes and look again.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I should like well to end this article with an urgent re-
<br/>commendation to those who have read what I have written
<br/>with any fixed attention, if they have not already done it, to
<br/>look up the essays of William Hazlitt on Art, particularly one
<br/>first published, I believe, in the Edinburgh Encyclopædia un-
<br/>der the title of “ The Fine Arts,” and since republished in
<br/>the same covers with some nonsense, by Haydon on Painting,
<br/>and read them with the attention which the best writings on
<br/>the subject in the English language demand. For in theory,
<br/>they say all that need be said, and had the practical know-
<br/>ledge of their author kept pace with his clear profound
<br/>thoughts and perceptions, the world would not now, perhaps,
<br/>lack at least one modern example of a painter worthy to
<br/>stand beside the great departed ones of old. As it is, we
<br/>have gained a critic of unequalled excellence, who needs first
<br/>to be fairly accepted, to prepare the way for the practical
<br/>talent that will inevitably, soon or late, bring into use what
<br/>he has so ably prepared for the painter who can put his truths
<br/>into his pictures.	william page.</p>
         <p>THE GREAT TOWER OF TARUDANT.
(Concluded from page 171.)
</p>
         <p>At the dawn of day next morning, King Abdallah was
<br/>roused from sleep by a strain of solemn music, that sent a
<br/>thrill of joy and gratitude through his frame, and gave unu-
<br/>sual fervency to his sunrise prayers. When he had bathed
<br/>and breakfasted, the same emir who had received him into
<br/>the city, came to conduct him to the royal palace. They pro-
<br/>ceeded through several noble streets, crowded with animated
<br/>but orderly multitudes, and soon reached the queen’s palace,
<br/>which stood upon a slightly elevated platform in the centre
<br/>of the city. This edifice was not of great extent, but its
<br/>beauty anil splendor excited the king's admiration more than
<br/>anything he had yet beheld. It was a glowing mass of pre-
<br/>cious stones; the foundations were of emerald, the walls of
<br/>beryl, the roof of amethyst, supported by lofty and elegant
<br/>columns of topaz, while the doors and windows were set with
<br/>diamonds, pearls, and other gems of richest worth. A beau-
<br/>tiful garden environed it, whose plants and flowers were
<br/>scarcely more numerous than the brightly plumaged birds
<br/>that sang and sported amidst them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>On the terrace before the palace the king was met by the
<br/>fairy who had guided him through the desert. She said,
<br/>“ King of Tarudant, my sister awaits your arrival in the
<br/>great hall of audience ; I will conduct you to her presence."
<br/>Taking Abdallah's hand, she led him through apartments
<br/>whose magnificent beauty baffles description ; they were full
<br/>of what seemed to them on entering, to be martial looking
<br/>guards, but as he passed through their bending ranks, they
<br/>changed into beautiful boys, holding olive branches and
<br/>wearing white garments.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The king of Tarudaut entered the audience chamber with
<br/>a throbbing heart, for a mysterious impression in the depths
<br/>of his soul assured him that his destiny depended on the fairy
<br/>queen, and that even more than the recovery of his kingdom</p>
         <p/>
         <p>was involved in the events that were about to occur. As he
<br/>passed the arched and lofty portal, which was cut through
<br/>one enormous sapphire, his eager eyes glanced rapidly over
<br/>the brilliant throng of courtiers, guards, and emirs, till they
<br/>rested on the person of the sovereign herself. He had expect-
<br/>ed to behold a grave and majestic figure, but he saw instead
<br/>a form delicate even to slightness, so exquisitely moulded,
<br/>that not the countenance alone but every visible part pos-
<br/>sessed a defined expression of beauty and goodness. The
<br/>loveliness of her face was radiant like a star; it shone with
<br/>such sweetness and simplicity, that the tender woman, the
<br/>pitying angel and the sinless child seemed combined in its
<br/>gracefully animated lineaments. While the king’s eyes drank
<br/>in these wondrous charms, their fascinating influence glided
<br/>onwards to his heart, and there stamped an impression that
<br/>nor time nor eternity could ever efface.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Still holding the hand of his guide, whose form and fea-
<br/>tures seemed almost unlovely contrasted with those of her
<br/>sister, the king walked slowly onwards amid the murmur-
<br/>ing salutations of the multitude that filled the hall. As he
<br/>approached, the queen arose from the throne of pure gold
<br/>whereon she had been seated, and descending its steps of
<br/>sardine stone, came towards him, with a group of beautiful
<br/>young girls bearing up the train of her flowing purple robe.
<br/>When within a few steps she stopped, and the king was
<br/>about to speak, when at that moment the fairy, whose hand
<br/>he held, withdrew it, and moving forward met her sister
<br/>with a warm embrace. While the kiss of greeting yet lin-
<br/>gered on their lips, the two forms mingled into one ! By a
<br/>sudden, almost imperceptible transition, the sisters became
<br/>before the eyes of Abdallah, a single being, possessing the
<br/>traits of both, and yet not wholly like either. The stately
<br/>elegance of one was subdued and softened by the graceful
<br/>beauty of the other. The rich carnation that had glowed
<br/>in the cheeks of the mountain queen, was visible beneath the
<br/>pale complexion of the fairy from the well, whose clear blue
<br/>eyes shone brightly as ever, but with a deep tenderness that
<br/>added to their charms a thousand fold. In the smile that
<br/>dwelt upon those ruby lips the king could recognise familiar
<br/>lines, but the gentle sweetness to which his heart responded,
<br/>awoke no echo in his memory. The raiment, too, of the sis-
<br/>ters, had combined in the garments that covered the new-
<br/>formed person—the blue, star-spangled dress of the desert
<br/>fairy appearing above the queenly purple robe.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>While the king vet stood gazing in amaze at this trans-
<br/>figured being, she addressed him in a voice of most melodious
<br/>sweetness. “ Be not alarmed, O king of Tarudant, at behold-
<br/>ing your friend and guide thus merged into another. Though
<br/>much has been added to me, nought has been taken away.
<br/>My sister and I were one from the beginning. How we were
<br/>separated, you shall be informed ; know now, that by your
<br/>means alone, through the sufferings of your kingdom, and
<br/>through your steadfast faith, could we be reinstated. It is at
<br/>length accomplished, Bright is the future that awaits you.
<br/>I know the thought that fills your mind, the cherished hope
<br/>that glows in your heart. I have not witnessed your courage
<br/>and your constancy with an unmoved soul; they deserve and
<br/>shall receive the highest reward that I can bestow.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The king sank upon his knees before the beautiful fairy,
<br/>and fervently kissed her hand ; she gently bade him rise, and
<br/>when he stood once more upon his feet, behold, the multi-
<br/>tude that but now had filled the hall, had vanished every
<br/>one. Silence reigned within those royal walls, and there
<br/>was none to break it save the king and the glorious being
<br/>whom his soul adored. Then, unseen by mortal eye, unheard
<br/>by mortal ear, the vows of everlasting love and faith were
<br/>breathed; the kiss of plighted troth exchanged, and side by
<br/>side the fairy Queen and King Abdallah knelt down to ask a
<br/>blessing on their union from the Giver of all good.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>That same night the blaze of torches and bonfires, the
<br/>shouting and dancing of the people announced and celebrated
<br/>throughout the airy kingdom, the nuptials of its queen.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After a week, a brief, brief week of enjoyment and festivi-
<br/>ty, King Abdallah and his bride descended from the moun-
<br/>tain capital, determined to recover the kingdom of Tarudant
<br/>and overthrow the Egyptian magician and his thrice accurs-
<br/>ed tower. They were accompanied by a numerous train of
<br/>gay and beautiful youths and maidens, who, to distant look-
<br/>ers-on, exhibited all the appearance of a powerful army
<br/>marching to meet some formidable foe.</p>
         <p>As they passed across the desert, the blessed influence of
the fairy was exerted with such strength that springs of wa-
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page203"/>
         </p>
         <p>ter burst from the sand wherever site pointed the golden
<br/>sceptre which she carried; while along the line of march as
<br/>soon as her train had passed, flowers and plants sprung up;
<br/>so that when they had reached the borders of Tarudant,'
<br/>there was a broad belt of rich vegetation extending across
<br/>the deserts, and uniting the two kingdoms.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>About noon, on the third day (for the fairy caused the ca-
<br/>valcade to proceed with more than morbid speed) they came
<br/>in sight of the great tower, standing in its solitary magnifi-
<br/>cence, amid a desolation more terrible than that of the de-
<br/>sert, in whose monotonous sands there was nothing to remind
<br/>the beholder of former animation or prosperity, while here
<br/>on every side were strewed the wrecks of recent life and hap-
<br/>piness. Drawing nigh, they perceived that the edifice, though
<br/>still glittering with gems and gold, with silver, brass and
<br/>ivory was much dilapidated, and stained and weather-beaten,
<br/>as though a thousand years had beheld it instead of a few
<br/>short weeks. The smoke, too, which yet gushed from its
<br/>summit, was thin and pale, and swayed about uncertainly,
<br/>as if scarcely able to rise through the atmosphere. Of the
<br/>monstrous green birds, two alone were left, who were perch-
<br/>ed upon the top of the tower, feebly flapping their wings,
<br/>seemingly too weak to fly.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They halted before the great gate of the tower, and the queen
<br/>directed Abdallah to take a bow and three arrows from one
<br/>of the youths in her train. With one arrow he pierced one
<br/>of the birds which fell back dead upon the tower. Its com-
<br/>panion uttering a low shriek, attempted to fly away, but af-
<br/>ter vainly fluttering its wings in the air for a moment, it
<br/>slowly fell to the ground, and lay there gasping in the last
<br/>extremity.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The king shot a second arrow at the centre of the tower,
<br/>which caused the edifice to reel to and fro, as though rocked
<br/>by an earthquake. A third bolt directed at the great gates,
<br/>sent the tower tumbling to the ground with a thunderous
<br/>shock that might have been heard half-way to Mount Atlas.
<br/>For a minute all was darkness, so filled was the air with
<br/>dust and smoke ; then there was the rushing of innumerable
<br/>wings, as the genies who had filled the lower fled affrighted
<br/>away—those only remaining who were too much bruised to
<br/>escape.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Presently there emerged from the ruins, crawling on his
<br/>hands and knees amid the rubbish, a little deformed figure,
<br/>which none could ever have believed to be the haughty Ar-
<br/>phaxad, who had known him only in the days of his gran-
<br/>deur. Yet he it was, in his true natural shape, such as he
<br/>wore on his first appearance in Tarudant. He crept humbly
<br/>towards the king, and lifted up his hands imploring pardon.
<br/>Abdallah drew his sword, and would have cutoff the wretch’s
<br/>head, but the fairy stayed his arm, saying, “Suffer him to
<br/>live—revenge does not become a king. He may repent him
<br/>of his evil deeds, and grow a better man. Besides, he hath
<br/>great and wondrous skill, which, rightly directed, will restore
<br/>the kingdom even with more speed than it was destroyed.
<br/>Spare him, therofore, and use him, but trust him not, he is a
<br/>good servant but a terrible master.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Abdallah hearkened to the voice of the queen. The ma-
<br/>gician was spared, and, controlled by the wisdom of the fairy,
<br/>and the firmness of the king, exerted his vast powers, through
<br/>many years as successfully for good purposes as he formerly
<br/>had for evil. Tarudant recovered and indeed excelled its for-
<br/>mer prosperity, and when at the end of a lengthened reign,
<br/>Abdallah was summoned to his fathers, he left the most
<br/>flourishing kingdom of the Moslem world to a son who in-
<br/>herited much of the goodness and wisdom of his fairy mo-
<br/>ther, and left the kingdom unimpaired to a long line of
<br/>equally fortunate successors.</p>
         <p>ROBERT OLIVER.
THE UNIVERSALITY OF HUMAN EMOTIONS.
</p>
         <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson says in one of his essays, “what
<br/>one man has felt all men may feel.” It is a simple truth
<br/>which any body might utter, although, simple as it is, there
<br/>are but few who seem to know it. Grave men spend years
<br/>of their lives ; many, all their lives, in the study of human
<br/>nature as it is revealed in history, when they have only to
<br/>study themselves, to know all of their kind, that they are
<br/>capable of knowing. A man may comprehend the feelings
<br/>of all other men who have capacities like his own, but he</p>
         <p/>
         <p>can neither go a step above or below his own level. An an-
<br/>gel and a devil, are alike incomprehensible to him. He
<br/>must be a strangely organized being who can find no second
<br/>self. In reading Eӧthen I was startled to discover that the
<br/>author of that pleasant book had once experienced a sensa-
<br/>tion which had troubled me at the same period of life, and
<br/>which I had never been able to make any body comprehend.
<br/>Perhaps another, in reading his description of his feelings,
<br/>may not comprehend them as I do, unless he has himself
<br/>experienced them. He is speaking of the effect of the great
<br/>pyramid on his mind.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ When I was very young, between the ages of three and
<br/>five years, being then of delicate health, I was often in time
<br/>of night the victim of a strange kind of mental oppression; I
<br/>lay in my bed perfectly conscious, and with open eyes, but
<br/>without power to speak, or move, and all the while my brain
<br/>was oppressed to distraction by the presence of a single and
<br/>abstract idea, the idea of solid immensity. It seemed to me
<br/>in my agonies that the horror of this visitation arose from its
<br/>coming upon me without form or shape ; the close presence
<br/>of the direst monster ever bred in Hell, would have been a
<br/>thousand times more tolerable than that simple idea of solid
<br/>size; my aching mind was fixed, and riveted down upon the
<br/>mere quality of vastness, vastness, vastness: and was not
<br/>permitted to invest it with any particular object. If I could
<br/>have done so the torment would have ceased. When at
<br/>last I was roused from this state of suffering, I could not of
<br/>course in those days, knowing no metaphysical distinctions ex-
<br/>cept by the dreadful experience of an abstract idea, find
<br/>words to express the nature of my sensations, and even now
<br/>I cannot explain why it is that the forced contemplation of
<br/>a mere quality, distinct from matter, should be so terrible.
<br/>Well, now my eyes saw and knew, and my feet informed
<br/>my understanding that there was nothing abstract about the
<br/>great Pyramid; it was a big triangle, sufficiently concrete,
<br/>easy to see, and rough to the touch ; it could not, of course,
<br/>affect me with the peculiar sensation which I have been talk-
<br/>ing of, but yet there was something akin to the old night-
<br/>mare agony in the terrible completeness with which a mere
<br/>mass of masonry could fill and load my mind.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Not only did I suffer the same unspeakable agonies in my
<br/>early childhood, but often since, my mind has been oppressed
<br/>by the contemplation of a solid mass of masonry, and the suf-
<br/>ferings of my early years recalled vividly to my recollection,
<br/>in the same manner that the author was affected by a sight
<br/>of the Pyramid of Ghizeh. There is nothing oppressive in
<br/>the sight of a well proportioned building, or in a high moun-
<br/>tain, but such heaps of granite and marble as the Exchange
<br/>and Custom-House, in Wall-street, seem to weigh upon the
<br/>mind like a nightmare.	H. F.</p>

THE NEW COMEDY BY MRS. MOWATT.
</p>
         <p>The plot of “ Fashion” runs thus : Adam Trueman, a blunt, warm-
<br/>hearted shrewd, irascible, wealthy, and generous old farmer of Cat-
<br/>taraugus county, N. Y., had a daughter, (Ruth) who eloped with an
<br/>adventurer. The father forgave the daughter, but resolving to disap-
<br/>point the hopes of the fortune hunter, gave the couple a bare subsis-
<br/>tence In consequence of this, the husband maltreated, and finally
<br/>abandoned the wife, who returned, broken-hearted, to her father’s
<br/>house and there died, after giving birth to a daughter, Gertrude.
<br/>That she might escape the ills of fortune-hunting by which her mother
<br/>was destroyed, Trueman scat the child, at an early age, to be brought
<br/>up by relatives in Geneva ; giving his own neighbours to understand
<br/>that she was dead. The Geneva friends were instructed to educate
<br/>her in habits of self-dependence, and to withold from her the secret
<br/>of her parentage, and heirship ;-the grandfather’s design being to se</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page204"/>
         </p>
         <p>cure for her a husband who will love her solely for herself. The
<br/>friends by advice of the grandfather, procured for her when grown up
<br/>to womanhood, a situation as music teacher in the house of Mr. Tif-
<br/>fany, a quondam foot-pedlar, and now by dint of industry a dry-goods
<br/>merchant doing a flashy if not flourishing business; much of his suc-
<br/>cess having arisen from the assistance of Trueman, who knew him
<br/>and admired his honest industry as a travelling pedlar.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The efforts of the dry goods merchant, however, are insufficient to
<br/>keep pace with the extravagance of his wife, who has become infected
<br/>with a desire to shine as a lady of fashion, in which desire she is sec-
<br/>onded by her daughter, Seraphina, the musical pupil of Gertrude.
<br/>The follies of the mother and daughter so far involve Tiffany as to
<br/>lead him into a forgery of a friend’s endorsement. This crime is sus-
<br/>pected by his confidential clerk, Snobson, an intemperate blackguard,
<br/>who at length extorts from his employer a confession, under a prom-
<br/>ise of secresy provided that Seraphina shall become Mrs. Snobson.
<br/>Mrs. Tiffany, however, is by no means privy to this arrangement:
<br/>she is anxious to secure a title for Seraphina, and advocates the
<br/>pretensions of Count Jolimaitre, a quondam English cook, barber,
<br/>and valet, whose real name was Gustave Treadmill, and who, having
<br/>spent much time at Paris, suddenly took leave of that city, for that
<br/>city’s good, and his own; abandoning to despair a little laundress
<br/>(Millinette) to whom he was betrothed, but who had rashly entrusted
<br/>him with the whole of her hard earnings during life.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Gertrude is beloved (for her own sake) by Colonel Howard “ of the
<br/>regular army,” and returns his affection. The Colonel, however
<br/>makes no proposal, because he considers that his salary of “fifteen
<br/>hundred a year” is no property of his own, but belongs to his credi-
<br/>tors. He has endorsed for a friend to the amount of seven thousand
<br/>dollars, and is left to settle the debt as he can. He talks, therefore,
<br/>of resigning, going west, making a fortune, returning, and then offer-
<br/>ing his hand with his fortune, to Gertrude.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>At this juncture, Trueman pays a visit to his old friend Tiffany!
<br/>and is put at fault in respect to the true state of Gertrude’s heart (and
<br/>indeed of every thing else) by the tattle of Prudence, Mrs. Tiffany’s
<br/>old-maiden sister. She gives the old man to understand that Gertrude
<br/>is in love with T. Tennyson Twinkle, a poet who is in the sad habit
<br/>of reading aloud his own verses, but who has really very respectable
<br/>pretensions, as times go. T. T. T. nevertheless, has no thought of
<br/>Gertrude, but is making desperate love to the imaginary money-bags
<br/>of Seraphina. He is rivalled, however, not only by the Count, but
<br/>by Augustus Fogg, a gentleman of excessive haut ton, who wears
<br/>black and has a general indifference to every thing but hot suppers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Millinette, in the mean time, has followed her deceiver to America,
<br/>and happens to make an engagement as femme de chambre and general
<br/>instructor in Parisian modes, at the very house (of all houses in the
<br/>world) where her Gustave, as Count Jolimaitre, is paying his addres-
<br/>ses to Miss Tiffany. The laundress recognizes the cook, who, at first
<br/>overwhelmed with dismay, fiually recovers his self-possession, and
<br/>whispers to his betrothed a place of appointment at which he prom-
<br/>ises to “ explain all.” This appointment is overheard by Gertrude,
<br/>who for some time has had her suspicions of the Count. She resolves
<br/>to personate Millinette in the interview, and thus obtain means of ex-
<br/>posing the impostor. Contriving therefore to detain the femme de
<br/>chambre from the assignation, she herself (Gertrude) blowing out the
<br/>candles and disguising her voice, meets the Count at the appointed
<br/>room in Tiffany’s house, while the rest of the company (invited to a
<br/>ball) are at supper. In order to accomplish the detention of Milli-
<br/>nette, she has been forced to give some instructions to Zeke (re-bap
<br/>tized Adolph by Mrs. Tiffany) a negro footman in the Tiffany livery.
<br/>These instructions are overheard by Prudence, who mars everything
<br/>by bringing the whole household into the room of appointment before
<br/>any secret has been extracted from the Count. Matters are made
<br/>worse for Gertrude by a futile attempt on the Count’s part to conceal
<br/>himself in a closet. No explanations are listened to. Mrs. Tiffany
<br/>and Seraphina are in a great rage—Howard is in despair—and True-
<br/>man entertains so bad an opinion of his grandaughter that he has an
<br/>idea of suffering her still to remain in ignorance of his relationship.
<br/>The company disperse in much admired disorder, and everything is at
<br/>odds and ends.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Finding that she can get no one to hear her explanations, Gertrude
<br/>writes an account of all to her friends at Geneva. She is interrupted
<br/>by Trueman—shows him the letter—he comprehends all—and hurries
<br/>the lovers into the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Tiffany, the former of
<br/>whom is in despair, and the latter in high glee at information just re-
<br/>ceived that Seraphina has eloped with Count Jolimaitre.</p>
         <p>While Trueman is here avowing his relationship, bestowing Ger-
</p>
         <p>trude upon Howard, and relieving Tiffany from the fangs of Snobson
<br/>by showing that person that he is an accessary to his employer’s for-
<br/>gery, Millinette enters, enraged at the Count’s perfidy to herself, and
<br/>exposes him in full. Scarcely has she made an end when Seraphina
<br/>appears in search of her jewels, which the Count, before committing
<br/>himself by the overt act of matrimony, has insisted upon her securing.
<br/>As she does not return from this errand, however, sufficiently soon,
<br/>her lover approaches on tip-toe to see what has become of her; is
<br/>seen and caught by Millinette ; and finding the game up, confesses
<br/>every thing with exceeding nonchalance. Trueman extricates Tiffany
<br/>from his embarrassments on condition of his sending his wife and
<br/>daughter to the country to get rid of their fashionable notions ; and
<br/>even carries his generosity so far as to establish the Count in a res-
<br/>taurant with the proviso that he, the Count, shall in the character and
<br/>proper habiliments of cook Treadmill, carry around his own adver-
<br/>tisement to all the fashionable acquaintances who had solicited his
<br/>intimacy while performing the role of Count Jolimaitre.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We presume that not even the author of a plot such as this, would
<br/>be disposed to claim for it any thing on the score of originality or in-
<br/>vention. Had it, indeed, been designed as a burlesque upon the ar-
<br/>raut conventionality of stage incidents in general, we should have re-
<br/>garded it as a palpable hit. And, indeed, while on the point of abso-
<br/>lute unoriginality, we may as well include in one category both the
<br/>events and the characters. The testy yet generous old grandfather,
<br/>who talks in a domineering tone, contradicts every body, slaps all
<br/>mankind on the back, thumps his cane on the floor, listens to nothing,
<br/>chastises all the fops, comes to the assistance of all the insulted wo-
<br/>men, and relieves all the dramatis personae from all imaginable dilem-
<br/>mas:—the hen-pecked husband of low origin, led into difficulties by
<br/>his vulgar and extravagant wife :—the die-away daughter aspiring to
<br/>be a Countess :—the villain of a clerk who aims at the daughter’s hand
<br/>through the fears of his master, tome of whose business secrets he
<br/>possesses :—the French grisette metamorphosed into the dispenser of
<br/>the highest Parisian modes and graces :—the intermeddling old maid
<br/>making bare-faced love to every unmarried man the meets :—the stiff
<br/>and stupid man of high fashion who utters only a single set phrase :—
<br/>the mad poet reciting his own verses:—the negro footman in livery
<br/>impressed with a profound sense of his own consequence, and obeying
<br/>with military promptness all orders from every body:—the patient,
<br/>accomplished, and beautiful governess, who proves in the end to be
<br/>the heiress of the testy old gentleman :—the high-spirited officer, in
<br/>love with the governess, and refusing to marry her in the first place
<br/>because he is too poor, and in the second place because she is too rich:
<br/>and, lastly, the foreign impostor with a title, a drawl, an eye-glass,
<br/>and a moustache, who makes love to the supposititious heiress of the
<br/>play in strutting about the stage with his coat-tails thrown open after'
<br/>the fashion of Robert Macaire, and who, in the end, is exposed and
<br/>disgraced through the instrumentality of some wife or mistress w hom
<br/>he has robbed and abandoned:—these things we say, together with
<br/>such incidents as one person supplying another’s place at an assigna-
<br/>tion, and such equivoques as arise from a surprisal in such cases—the
<br/>concealment and discovery of one of the parlies in a closet—and the
<br/>obstinate refusal of all the world to listen to an explanation, are the
<br/>common and well-understood property of the play-wright, and have
<br/>been so, unluckily, time out of mind.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But, for this very reason, they should be abandoned at once. Their
<br/>hackneyism is no longer to be endured. The day has at length ar-
<br/>rived when men demand rationalities in place of conventionalities. It
<br/>will no longer do to copy, even with absolute accuracy, the whole tone
<br/>of even so ingenious and really spirited a thing as the “ School for
<br/>Scandal.” It was comparatively good in its day, but it would be posi-
<br/>tively bad at the present day, and imitations of it are inadmissible at
<br/>any day.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Bearing in mind the spirit of these observations, we may say that
<br/>“ Fashion” is theatrical but not dramatic. It is a pretty well-arranged
<br/>selection from the usual routine of stage characters, and stage ma-
<br/>noeuvres—but there is not one particle of any nature beyond green-
<br/>room nature, about it. No such events ever happened in fact, or ever
<br/>could happen, as happen in“ Fashion.” Nor arc we quarrelling, now,
<br/>with the mere exaggeration of character or incident—were this all,
<br/>the play, although bad as comedy might be good as farce, of which
<br/>the exaggeration of possible incongruities is the chief element.
<br/>Our fault-finding is on the score of deficiency in verisimilitude—In na-
<br/>tural art—that is to say, iu art based in the natural laws of man’s
<br/>heart and understanding.</p>
         <p>When, for example, Mr. Augustus Fogg (whose name by the bye
has little application to his character) says, in reply to Mrs. Tiffany’s
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p>
         <p>invitation to the conservatory, that he is “ indifferent to flowers,” and
<br/>replies in similar terms to every observation addressed to him, neither
<br/>are we affected by any sentiment of the farcical, nor can we feel any
<br/>sympathy in the answer on the ground of its being such as any human
<br/>being would naturally make at all times to all queries—making no
<br/>other answer to any. Were the thing absurd in itself, we should laugh,
<br/>and a legitimate effect would be produced ; but unhappily the only ab-
<br/>surdity we perceive is the absurdity of the author in keeping so point-
<br/>less a phrase in any character’s mouth. The shameless importunities
<br/>of Prudence to Trueman are in the same category—that of a total de-
<br/>ficiency in verisimilitude, without any compensating incongruousness—
<br/>that is to say, farcicalness, or humor. Also in the same category we
<br/>must include the rectangular crossings and recrossings of the dramatis
<br/>personas on the stage ; the coming forward to the foot-lights when any
<br/>thing of interest is to be told; the reading of private letters in a loud
<br/>rhetorical tone ; the preposterous soliloquising; and the even more
<br/>preposterous “asides.” Will our play-wrights never learn, through
<br/>the dictates of common sense, that an audience under no circumstances
<br/>can or will be brought to conceive that what is sonorous in their own
<br/>ears at a distance of fifty feet from the speaker cannot be heard by an
<br/>actor at the distance of one or two?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>No person of common ingenuity will be willing to admit that even
<br/>the most intricate dramatic narrative could not be rendered intelligible
<br/>without these monstrous inartisticalities. They are the relics of a day
<br/>when men were content with but little of that true Art whose nature
<br/>they imperfectly understood, and are now retained solely through that
<br/>supine spirit of imitation which grows out of the drama itself as the
<br/>chief of the imitative arts, and which has had so much to do in degra-
<br/>ding it, in effect, by keeping it stationary while all of its sisters have
<br/>been making rapid progress. The drama has not declined as many
<br/>suppose : it has only been left out of sight by every thing else. We
<br/>must discard all models. The Elizabethan theatre should be aban-
<br/>doned. We need thought of our own—principles of dramatic action
<br/>drawn not from the “ old dramatists” but from the fountain of a Na-
<br/>ture that can never grow old.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It must be understood that we arc not condemning Mrs. Mowatt’s
<br/>comedy in particular, but the modern drama in general. Compara-
<br/>tively, there is much merit in “ Fashion,” and in many respects (and
<br/>those of a telling character) it is superior to any American play. It
<br/>has, in especial, the very high merit of simplicity in plot. What the
<br/>Spanish play-wrights mean by dramas of intrigue are the worst acting
<br/>dramas in the world:—the intellect of an audience can never safely
<br/>be fatigued by complexity. The necessity for verbose explanation on
<br/>the part of Trueman at tne close of “ Fashion” is, however, a serious
<br/>defect. The denouement should in all cases be full of action and nothing
<br/>else. Whatever cannot be explained by such action should be commu-
<br/>nicated at the opening of the play.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The colloquy in Mrs. Mowatt’s comedy is spirited, generally terse,
<br/>and well seasoned at points with sarcasm of much power. The ma-
<br/>nagement throughout shows the fair authoress to be thoroughly conver-
<br/>sant with our ordinary stage effects, and we might say a good deal in
<br/>commendation of some of the “ sentiments” interspersed :—we are
<br/>really ashamed, nevertheless, to record our deliberate opinion that if
<br/>"Fashion” succeed at all (and we think upon the whole that it will)
<br/>it will owe the greater portion of its success to the very carpets, the
<br/>very ottomans, the very chandeliers, and the very conservatories that
<br/>gained so decided a popularity for that most inane and utterly despi-
<br/>cable of all modem comedies—the “ London Assurance” of Bourci-
<br/>cault.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The above remarks were written before the comedy’s representa-
<br/>tion at the Park, and were based on the author’s original MS., in which
<br/>some modifications have been made—and not at all times, we really
<br/>think, for the better. A good point, for example has been omitted,
<br/>at the denouement. In the original, Trueman (as will be seen in our
<br/>digest) pardons the Count, and even establishes him in a restaurant,
<br/>on condition of his carrying around to all his fashionable acquaintances
<br/>his own advertisement as restaurateur. There is a piquant, and dash-
<br/>ing deviation, here, from the ordinary routine of stage “poetic justice,
<br/>which could uot have failed to tell, and which was, perhaps, the one
<br/>original point of the play. We can conceive no good reason for its
<br/>omission. A scene, also, has been introduced, to very little purpose.
<br/>We watched its effect narrowly, and found it null. It narrated no-
<br/>thing; it illustrated nothing; and was absolutely nothing in itself.
<br/>Nevertheless it might have been introduced for the purpose of
<br/>giving time for some other scenic arrangements going on out of
<br/>sight.</p>
         <p>The comedy was thus cast:
Adam Trueman.......................Mr. Chippendale.
Count de Jolimaitre....................W. H. Crisp.
Colonel Howard .	•	•	•	• Dyott.
Mr. Tiffany ................................Barry.
Mr. T. Tennison Twinkle .	. De Walden.
Mr. Augustus Fog .	.	.	.	• Bridges.
Mr. Pnobson ..... Fisher.
Zeke, a colored servant	.	.	• Skerrett
Master of the ceremonies .	.	.	. Gallot.
Mrs. Tiffany.............................Mrs. Barry.
Gertrude ...	. Miss Clara Ellis.
Seraphina Tiffany .	.	. Miss Kate Horn.
Prudence ..... Mrs. Knight.
Millinette..................................Dyott
</p>
         <p>A well written prologue was well delivered by Mr. Crisp, whose ac-
<br/>tion is far better than his reading—although the latter, with one ex-
<br/>ception, is good. It is pure irrationality to recite verse, as if it were
<br/>prose, without distinguishing the lines :—we shall touch this subject
<br/>again. As the Count, Mr. Crisp did every thing that could be done
<br/>his grace of gesture is preeminent. Miss Home looked charmingly as
<br/>Seraphina. Trueman and Tiffany were represented with all possible
<br/>effect by Chippendale and Barry and Mrs. Barry as Mrs. Tiffany
<br/>was the life of the play. Zeke was caricatured. Dyott makes a bad
<br/>colonel—his figure is too diminutive. Prudence was well exaggera-</p>
         <p>ted by Mrs. Knight—and the character in her hands, elicited more ap-
plause than any one other of the dramatis personae.
</p>
         <p>Some of the author’s intended points were lost through the inevita-
<br/>ble inadvertences of a first representation—but upon the whole, every
<br/>thing went off exceedingly well. To Mrs. Barry we would suggest
<br/>that the author’s intention was, perhaps, to have élite pronounced
<br/>ee-light, and bouquet, bokett;—the effect would be more certain. To
<br/>Zeke we would say, bring up the table bodily by all means (as origi-
<br/>nally designed) when the fow tool is called for. The scenery was very
<br/>good indeed—and the carpet, ottomans, chandelier, etc. were also ex-
<br/>cellent of their kind. The entire “ getting up” was admirable.
<br/>“ Fashion,” upon the whole, was well received by a large, fashionable,
<br/>and critical audience ; and will succeed to the extent we have suggest-
<br/>ed above. Compared with the generality of modern dramas, it is a
<br/>good play—compared with most American dramas it if? a very good
<br/>one—estimated by the natural principles of dramatic art, it is altogeth-
<br/>er unworthy of notice.	P.</p>
         <p>THE CONCERT ROOM.
</p>
         <p>Signor Sanquirico’s Concert.—The Opera House was well filled
<br/>on Monday evening, on the occasion of the artist’s benefit. Signora
<br/>Pico, Madame Otto, Mesdames Desjardines and Felicia, Signors An-
<br/>tognini, De Begnis, Meyer, and Messrs. Grœneveldt, Kyle, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
<br/>assisted him in his endeavors.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The two first pieces we were fortunate enough to miss. No. 3, Grand
<br/>Duo, Convcnienze Teatrali, Donizetti, sung by Pico and Sanquirico, is
<br/>a dashing, sparkling, frothy sort of composition, and was executed
<br/>with less spirit than these artists usually display. No. 4 of the first
<br/>act, was, according to the programme, No. 5 of the third act. It was
<br/>a duett for the flute and clarionette by Messrs. Kyle and Grœneveldt.
<br/>It was the best thing of the evening. The composition was very
<br/>pleasing, but somewhat commonplace. The execution generally was
<br/>admirable, although there were some parts which might have gone
<br/>much better. Mr. Kyle has one very great fault—we allude to his
<br/>want of accentuation in his rapid passages, which frequently renders
<br/>his brilliant execution crowded and confused. If Mr. Grœneveldt has
<br/>a fault, it is in the exact opposite of this—viz., too much accentuation ;
<br/>the too great use of which renders the style hard, pedantic, and inele-
<br/>gant. This fault is, however, but rarely observed in Mr. Grœneveldt.
<br/>No. 5, Aria Finale, from Bctley, Se Crudele, by Madame Otto. When-
<br/>ever we hear this lady’s beautiful voice, we feel a regret that her mu-
<br/>sical education has not been more carefully attended to. She always
<br/>reminds us of a lady we knew in Baltimore, who sang just like a bird,
<br/>so freely, so entirely without effort did the rich volume of sound roll
<br/>from her parted lips. Madame Otto’s defects in style, and the imper-
<br/>fectness of her execution, must necessarily preclude the possibility
<br/>that she should do any justice to the higher walks of Italian or Ger-
<br/>man vocal music. In the national Tyrolean ballads, her voice is won-
<br/>derfully effective, and as friends to her and to her talent, we should ad-
<br/>vise her, for the sake of keeping up her popularity, to sing such songs
<br/>only as are within the compass of her execution. In Ocean, thou
<br/>mighty monster ! from Weber’s Oberon, Madam Otto sang out of tune,
<br/>so much so, and so continually out of time, os to distress the orches-
<br/>tra and to ruin the scena. The practice which Madame Otto continu-
<br/>ally exhibits, both in her Italian and English singing, of taking breath
<br/>audibly between the syllables of words, is quite fatal to effect, and its
<br/>correction should occupy her attention most earnestly.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>No. 6 was Rossini's Duo, I Marinari, sang by Signor Antognini and
<br/>executed by Signor Sanquirico. We are not behind the curtain in the
<br/>affairs of Italian artists, but if ever one man evidenced a determination
<br/>to sacrifice another, Sanquirico did on Monday last. This beautiful
<br/>duett is familiar to every one ; it is among the happiest of Rossini’s
<br/>later compositions, and requires to be sung con amore, with vigor and
<br/>with spirit. Signor Sanquirico drawled it out like a country psalm-
<br/>smiter ; and he drawled it out of tune, and the more he was urged on-
<br/>ward by Antognini and the band, the more cool and determined he
<br/>seemed, and the more he would not go. We do not know the reason
<br/>for this conduct, but be it what it may, it was disrespectful in the
<br/>highest degree to the public, and ungenerous, nay, unjust to Antog-
<br/>nini. The duett was of course hissed, although the hissing was meant
<br/>for Sanquirico, and Signor Antognini as soon as he sung the last note
<br/>turned his back upon the company and bounced off the stage, dashing
<br/>his music on the floor. Now the public had done nothing to ofl'end
<br/>the Signor; he might at least have made the usual obeisance, before
<br/>exhibiting his anger. Verily, these Italian artists are models for amia-
<br/>ble temper, brotherly love, good will and charity to all!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The orchestral arrangements of this duett by Signor Milon, were, as
<br/>far as we could judge from the imperfect way in which they were
<br/>played, very clever, clear, effective, and well conceived. The brass</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page206"/>
instruments, particularly, were well treated. We should like to hear
it done justice to.
</p>
         <p>The dancing was dreadful. Md’lle Desjardines has but a very im-
<br/>perfect idea of the meaning of the word grace; her “ toe” is neither
<br/>“ light” nor “ fantastic,” and her “ motion” is the most prosaic we
<br/>ever witnessed.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A poor little girl was discovered in an attitude, to reproduce which
<br/>would make the fortune of a sculptor; so peculiar and so original was
<br/>its character. Children so young should not be brought before the
<br/>public.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The third part consisted chiefly of selections from Il Barbiere. We
<br/>have noticed this opera so frequently that any remark at the present
<br/>time would be superfluous.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Signor De Beguis was the Figaro, and we never were more pleased
<br/>with his performance ; it was subdued and in perfect keeping. Pico
<br/>sang her music charmingly ; her execution was distinct and rapid, and
<br/>her ornaments, generally, in good taste. But her acting is devoid of
<br/>grace or originality, and she is more the country hoyden than the re-
<br/>fined Rosina.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Sanquirico sang his Scena Manca un foglie, with a great deal of
<br/>spirit, but his performance was by no means equal to many of his
<br/>previous performances of the same scena.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. P. Meyer sang Doniz tti’s Ft Raviso. He has a very fine Ba-
<br/>ritone voice, but he does not seem to know much about the art. He
<br/>sings without style, just as one untaught would sing. He appears to
<br/>be perfectly at home before the public, which is a great advantage to
<br/>a young artist. We think that Mr. Meyer would find it worth his
<br/>while to study diligently, for we are sadly in want of such a voice at
<br/>our concerts, and he might reap a rich harvest of professional engage-
<br/>ments during many months of the year.</p>
         <p>The duett between De Begnis and Sanquirico was well acted and
well sung, and gave much satisfaction to the audience.
</p>
         <p>When we left Pico, Sanquirico and De Begnis had been called out.
<br/>and we have every reason to believe, from the severe enthusiasm of the
<br/>audience, that every person concerned in the concert, even the gentle-
<br/>man who so kindly and so gracefully draws up the curtain when the
<br/>bell rings, shared the like honor.</p>
         <p>N. Y. VOCAL SOCIETY.
Mr. Editor:
</p>
         <p>Sir—Being one of the numerous and delighted auditory at this
<br/>Concert last. Saturday evening, I take the liberty of offering a few re-
<br/>marks on the performances thereof.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>	It was a rich repast to the unprejudiced amateur, being strictly
<br/>classical, and at the same time performed by the very “elite” of the
<br/>musical residents in the city, in a manner worthy of, and only to be
<br/>executed by the N. Y. Vocal Society—in a word, this society stands
<br/>in the same relationship to the admirers of the highest class of vocal
<br/>music as the Philharmonic does to the instrumentalists.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first act consisted of a liberal gleaning from the ever beautiful
<br/>opera of “ Semiramide,” in which Mrs. Loder sang to the admiration
<br/>of every one, and proved, (if proof were necessary) that she, being an
<br/>educated vocalist, is as equal to the classical music of one school as
<br/>another. The chorusses went with a precision and an unity of effect
<br/>so indispensable to the proper performing of the chromatic intricacies
<br/>with which Rossini’s concerted music abounds. I would suggest that
<br/>if the pianos and fortes were even more strictly observed than they
<br/>were, the effect would be still nearer to perfection. The rendition of
<br/>the beautiful quartette and chorus “ Di Tanti Regi,” conceived in
<br/>Rossini’s happiest mood, was greatly impaired by Mr. Watson’s sing-
<br/>ing flat almost entirely throughout the quartette—the result I believe
<br/>of severe cold. Miss De Luce gave her cavatina, “ Ah ! quel Giorao”
<br/>in a highly creditable manner. With a fine rich voice, all she has to
<br/>do is to get schooled—or in other words, to gain style and expression,
<br/>by practice and example, without which the finest voice will fail to
<br/>make the artiste. Miss Watson’s quiet and well conceived singing in the
<br/>aria and chorus “ In si barbara,” gives great promise for the future.
<br/>It was a pleasing and very chaste performance, and shows what she
<br/>will do when more experienced. Mr. Timm conducted the first part
<br/>and presided at the Piano as Mr. Timm always docs preside! Mr.
<br/>Kyle performed a solo on the flute with great eclat, although at a con-
<br/>cert of that kind I could have wi hed the subject chosen had been a
<br/>little more of the legitimate order,—the arrangement of the two airs,
<br/>“ Rory O’More” and the “ Angel’s Whisper,” is however exceedingly
<br/>clever. The second part ol the concert was conducted by Mr. G. Lo.
<br/>der in admirable style, an 1 consisted of a feast, to be enjoyed only at
<br/>this society, where the immortal compositions of the fine English wri-
<br/>ters of the “Madrigal” and “Glee” are alone to be heard to the best
<br/>advantage. They were all performed in admirable style, and but for
<br/>the lateness of the hour, and length of the programme, there would
<br/>have been several encores—the satisfaction evinced by the audience,
<br/>consisting of most of our musical connoisseurs and amateurs, and a
<br/>very large portion of the leading professors, gives evidence that the
<br/>N. Y. Vocal Society is looking up.	K.</p>
         <p>MUSICAL REVIEW.
</p>
         <p>“ Avezzana’s Quick Step.” Performed by the American Brass Band
<br/>and dedicated to Captain Avezzana, and the officers and members of
<br/>the New York Italian Guard, by C. Chianei.</p>
         <p>“ My Bark which o’er the tide.” Barcarole, from the new Opera of
the Daughter of St. Mark ; composed by M. W. Balfe.
The above are published by Millett at his Music Saloon, 329 Broad-
way.
</p>
         <p>“ Farewell, farewell, we meet no more below.” Sung by Mrs. E. Loder
<br/>written by Alfred Wheeler, Esq., music arranged and dedicated to
<br/>Mrs. J. S. Bennett of New York, by Austin Philips.</p>
         <p>“ Annerock Polka.” Composed and dedicated to his friend, Ferdi-
nand Graubner,, by Charles Perabeau.
The above are published by Firth, Hall &amp; Pond. 239 Broadway, and
No. 1 Franklin Square.
The Quick Step by Mr. Chianei, is very well adapted to the pur-
pose, and must prove highly effective when played by the band.
</p>
         <p>The song we noticed last week. It is the Barcarole from Balfe’s new
<br/>Opera. It is more expensively got out than the Boston edition, having
<br/>a full title, handsomely engraved.</p>
         <p>We understand that Mr. Millett has several other songs from the
Daughter of St. Mark in advance of the publisher.
</p>
         <p>Mr. Austin Phillips always makes a pretty song. He has a happy
<br/>vein of unfailing thought. Many of his compositions are exquisite in
<br/>their sentiment, and always musicianlike in their arrangement, al-
<br/>though we sometimes discover evidences of carelessness in the accom-
<br/>paniments. The song under notice is a sweet and plaintive melody in
<br/>F, well suited to the melancholy sentiment of the poetry. It is a song
<br/>well adapted for teaching, and doubtless Mr. Loder’s singing will ren-
<br/>der it popular.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Perabeau’s Polka is spirited and melodious. There is only one
<br/>Polka in the world, and that is the first one—every other must per-
<br/>force be a copy, for so peculiar and distinct is its character, that the
<br/>fancy can have but little play. Mr. Perabeau’s Polka is certainly one
<br/>of the best, and one of the most pleasing of the thousand and one
<br/>which have come under our notice of late.</p>
         <p>STODART &amp; DUNHAM’S PIANO FORTE MANUFACTORY.
</p>
         <p>Or the numerous articles of luxury with which our country abounds,
<br/>the Piano Forte is, without doubt, the most interesting in its manufac-
<br/>ture, the most universal in its adoption, and by far the most impor-
<br/>tant in our social arrangements for innocent and refined enjoyment.
<br/>Of its manufacture we shall speak at length below, as we feel assured
<br/>that the subject will prove highly interesting to our readers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As to the universality of its adoption, the fact is well accredited.
<br/>We find it in every country of Europe ,in manyparts of Asia, (the firm
<br/>of Stodart &amp; Co. have sent out many Pianos to China,) in Africa, in
<br/>Australia, throughout the length and breadth of this vast continent—
<br/>nay, even the very face of the ocean is dotted over with Piano Fortes.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Of its social importance every one can speak, for its benefits are
<br/>not confined to one particular class ; it will be often found where the
<br/>grosser luxuries of the palate and the vanities of dress have never in-
<br/>truded; and where it has found its way, it has always brought pleas-
<br/>ure and frequently solace and consolation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It may not be generally known, that in this country, nay, in this
<br/>city, the finest square Piano Fortes in the world are produced. We
<br/>know that it has been the fashion until very lately, for all those who
<br/>could afford such expensive luxury, to import from Europe their in-
<br/>struments, believing no article good, but such as bore the European
<br/>stamp. But experience has fully demonstrated the absurdity of this
<br/>practice, and justice has at length been reluctantly yielded to our own
<br/>manufacturers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Of the many admirable makers in this city, Stodart &amp; Dunham cer-
<br/>tainly rank among the very highest and best. Their name is known
<br/>all over the country, and it is indeed, as natural to expect to see the
<br/>name of Stodart upon a Piano, as that of Erard upon a Harp, for so
<br/>many, many years has the name been associated with the manufac-
<br/>ture of Pianos, both in this, and in the old country.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We will now conduct our readers to the factory of Messrs. Stodart
<br/>and Dunham. It is situated in Thirteenth street, between the Third
<br/>and Fourth avenues, directly opposite the Manhattan Reservoir. The
<br/>length of the building is one hundred and forty feet, and it is four sto-
<br/>ries in height. We shall proceed regularly with the description of
<br/>the manufacture, from the wood in the lumber-yard, to the elegantly
<br/>finished instrument.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Lumber-Yard is the first point which demands attention.
<br/>Around its spacious area, are stacked the various kinds of wood used
<br/>in the manufacture of Pianos, such as pine, oak, ash, rosewood, ma-</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page207"/>
         </p>
         <p>hogany, holly, maple, &amp;c. &amp;c. Many thousand dollars worth of such
<br/>stock will be found here, continually exposed to every change of wea-
<br/>ther—cold, heat, raiu, &amp;c., &amp;c., in order to inure it to all climates. The
<br/>wood remains in this state two or three years; that which is nearest
<br/>the drying-room is used first, the whole mass is then advanced forward
<br/>and the new stock, as it arrives, is placed in the rear of all. So that
<br/>it is all worked down in rotation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Veneer-Room is the next opened for inspection. Here are laid
<br/>the finely cut veneers, pile upon pile, containing thousands of feet of
<br/>the richest, rarest, and most expensive mahogany and rosewood. The
<br/>room itself is perfumed with the luxurious odor from the wood, and it
<br/>is truly a beautiful sight to observe the various and exquisite figures
<br/>in the graining of the different sorts of wood. We can safely say that
<br/>we never beheld more beautiful specimens of veneers, both as regards
<br/>gorgeousness of color, and elegance of figure, than were shown to us by
<br/>our frank and gentlemanly conductor, Mr. Dunham. The art of cut-
<br/>ting up veneers, is that in which Mr. D. excels, and doubtless many
<br/>thousands of dollars have been saved to the establishment by his
<br/>steady hand, and his mathematically correct eye. The difficulty con-
<br/>sists in cutting the figure to match, and at the same time avoiding all
<br/>unnecessary waste. The wood used here is all of the best quality ;
<br/>the finest Spanish mahogany, and the choicest rosewood from the
<br/>Rio Janeiro market. The wood is grown in the interior west of Rio,
<br/>and is brought to that port on the backs of mules, whence it is ship-
<br/>ped to all parts of the world. We can scarcely judge of the value of
<br/>the stock in this room, but we should it think about a thousand or fif-
<br/>teen hundred dollars.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Drying-Room comes next. Here the wood which is taken from
<br/>the yard is piled up in layers, carefully divided, over and around a
<br/>stove, by which the room is heated to an unbearable degree. A long
<br/>hot pipe is carried the entire length of the room, over which the wood
<br/>wanted for immediate use is placed. It is thoroughly dried, then taken
<br/>out, cooled, and dusted, and after having undergone once more the same
<br/>operation, it is conveyed through a trap-door to the case-room.</p>
         <p>We shall resume the notice of this establishment in our next.
MISCELLANY.
</p>
         <p>The recompense or English and American Artists.—The Lon-
<br/>don Art Union in commenting upon a picture by Edwin Landseer, of
<br/>a couple of spaniels, says :—</p>
         <p>“ Our readers will scarcely credit that which we can vouch for as a fact
</p>
         <p>--the picture was begun and finished within two days .' It wilt be readily be-
<br/>lieved that the painter received a very large sum for the work; and it is no-
<br/>torious that his paintings are purchased not only as fast as, but faster than,
<br/>they are produced. It is by no means unjust to infer, therefore, that in the
<br/>nineteenth century an artist might, if he pleased, obtain by the work of bis
<br/>own hands a fortune equal to that of the most fortunate of our “ Merchant
<br/>Princes”— and far beyond that which any predecessor in Art achieved during
<br/>the golden age of Leo X. It is known that one living painter has actually
<br/>amassed a store of wealth that would make a Lombard-street banker stare—
<br/>amassed It entirely by his own unaided labour. Such facts as these may not
<br/>be forgotten by the historian of Art in Britain in the nineteenth century.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If the fortune amassed by a British artist would make a Lombard-
<br/>street banker stare, it would go well nigh to deprive an American ar-
<br/>tist of bis sight. Our artists consider it a privilege to be allowed to
<br/>live at all; but in England, it appears that a great artist lives like a
<br/>merchant prince. During the past year one of the best painters that
<br/>America has yet produced, was forced to leave this city to seek em-
<br/>ployment in a provincial town, and another has been compelled to go
<br/>to England for employment, two, in truth, Inman and Doughty; while
<br/>another has found the patronage in Trance, which he tried after iu
<br/>vain at home. Wilkie lived grandly and died rich, but Alston lived
<br/>poorly and died in debt.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The English artists speak in very high terms of a landscape by
<br/>Doughty, a snow scene in New Hampshire, in the last exhibition of
<br/>the British Institution.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The celebrated Barberini Vase, was broken to pieces in the British
<br/>Museum, by a drunken fellow who was moved by an ambition like that
<br/>°f the incendiary of Ephesus.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The iconoclast was fined three pounds. The Museum possesses,
<br/>however, a copy of the Vase, which was cast from a model produced

         <p>A Mistake. The announcement, in several papers, that Edgar A. Poe
<br/>is to become editor of “ The Aristidean” (the new Democratic five-dol-
<br/>lar Monthly) is a mistake. The Aristidean” will continue to be
<br/>edited, and no doubt well edited, by T. D. English.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Erratum. In our notice last week of a poem by Mrs. Nicholls, we
<br/>spoke of her rhythm as anapœstic. We meant to say dactylic, of
<br/>course.</p>

Many thanks to “ Violet Vane,” and the “ Stranger.”

         <p>BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p>
         <p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<br/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<br/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<br/>otherwise are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<br/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will been
<br/>abled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-</p>
         <p>ians.
</p>
         <p>      This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same lime, and each lesson
<br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same pace.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from pro-
<br/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
<br/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<br/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<br/>names in the principal cities.</p>

</p>
         <p>This is a real book—not a sham. It displays a varied and comprehensive power of mind, and a genuine mastery over the first and strongest of mo-
<br/>dern languages. The author has caught the character and humor of the eastern mind as completely as Anastasius, while in his gorgeous descriptions and
<br/>power of sarcasm, he rivals Vathek. His terseness, vigor, and bold imagery, remind us of the brave old style of Fuller and of South, to which he adds a
<br/>spirit, freshness, and delicacy all his own.”—Quarterly Review.</p>

REPUBLICATION
OF THE
FOREIGN MAGAZINES.
LONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WEST-
 MINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD’S MAGA-
ZINE.
</p>
         <p>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
<br/>arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful dear type, on fine white paper
<br/>and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
<br/>act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
<br/>say much to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of
<br/>any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
<br/>is marked by a dignity, candor, and forbearance not often found in works of
<br/>a party character.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
<br/>and Radical. “ Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly” are Tory ; the
<br/>“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the " Westminster” Radical. The “For-
<br/>eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
<br/>foreign Continental Works.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign
<br/>copies ; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advan-
<br/>tage to the American over the English reader.</p>

<br/>Goldsmith’s Gems or Pennmanship.—The Chirographic art is
<br/>much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, und
<br/>Mr. Goldsmith may well claim to be considered at its head. The

<br/>to be “ more potent than the sword,” we never witnessed before.</p>
