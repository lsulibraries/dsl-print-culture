THE PREMATURE BURIAL.
</p>
         <p>There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorb-
<br/>ing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of le-
<br/>gitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if
<br/>he do not wish to offend, or to disgust. They are with propri-
<br/>ety handled, only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanc-
<br/>tify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most
<br/>intense of “ pleasurable pain,” over the accounts of the Pas-
<br/>sage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the
<br/>Plague at London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of
<br/>the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the
<br/>Black Hole at Calcutta. But, in these accounts, it is the fact
<br/>—it is the reality—it is the history which excites. As inven-
<br/>tions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and au-
<br/>gust calamities on record ; but, in these, it is the extent, not
<br/>less than the character of the calamity, which so vividly im-
<br/>presses the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from
<br/>the long and wierd catalogue of human miseries, I might have
<br/>selected many individual instances more replete with essential
<br/>suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. The 
<br/>true wretchedness, indeed—the ultimate woe—is particular,
<br/>not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured
<br/>by man the unit, and never by man the mass—for this let us
<br/>thank a merciful God !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To be buried while alive, is, beyond question, the most ter-
<br/>rific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere 
<br/>mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen, 
<br/>will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries
<br/>which divide Life from Death, are at best shadowy and vague.
<br/>Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other be- 
<br/>gins ? We know that there are diseases in which occur total
<br/>cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in
<br/>which these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so
<br/>called. They are only temporary pauses in the incomprehen-
<br/>sible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen |
<br/>mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and
<br/>the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not forever loosed,
<br/>nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, mean-
<br/>time, was the soul ?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori,
<br/>that such causes must produce such effects—that the well
<br/>known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must
<br/>naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments—
<br/>apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of
<br/>medical and ordinary experience, to prove that a vast number
<br/>of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer
<br/>at once, if necessary, to a hundred well authenticated instances.
<br/>One of very remarkable character, and of which the circum-
<br/>stances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers,
<br/>occurred, not very long ago, in the neighboring city of Balti- 
<br/>more, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and widely ex- 
<br/>tended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable 
<br/>citizens—a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress— 
<br/>was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which 
<br/>completely baffled the skill of her physicians. After much suf- |</p>
         <p/>
         <p>fering she died, or was supposed to die. No one suspected,
<br/>indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not actually
<br/>dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.
<br/>The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The
<br/>lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustre-
<br/>less. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For
<br/>three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it
<br/>had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short, was
<br/>hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was suppos-
<br/> ed to be decomposition.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three
<br/>subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this
<br/>term, it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus;—but,
<br/> alas! how fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, person-
<br/>ally, threw open the door. As its portals swung outwardly
<br/> back, some white-apparrelled object fell rattling within his arms.
<br/>It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmouldered shroud.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had re-
<br/>vived within two days after her entombment—that her strug-
<br/>gles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or
<br/>shelf, to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her es-
<br/>cape. A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil,
<br/>within the tomb, was found empty ; it might have been ex-
<br/>hausted, however, by evaporation. On the uppermost of the
<br/>steps which led down into the dread chamber, was a large frag-
<br/> ment of the coffin, with which it seemed that she had endea-
<br/>vored to arrest attention, by striking the iron door. While
<br/> thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through
<br/>sheer terror ; and, in falling, her shroud became entangled in
<br/>some iron-work which projected interiorly. Thus she remain-
<br/>ed, and thus she rotted, erect.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in
<br/>France, attended with circumstances which go far to warrant
<br/>the assertion that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The
<br/>heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade,
<br/>a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great per-
<br/> sonal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bos-
<br/>suet, a poor litterateur, or journalist, of Pans. His talents
<br/>and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of
<br/> the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved ;
<br/>but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to
<br/>wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker, and a diplomatist of some
<br/>eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman neglect-
<br/>ed, and. perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having
<br/>passed with him some wretched years, she died,—at least her
<br/>condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one
<br/>who saw her. She was buried—not in a vault—but in an or-
<br/>dinary grave in the village of her nativity. Filled with de-
<br/>spair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attach-
<br/>ment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote pro-
<br/>vince in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disin-
<br/>terring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses.
<br/>He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin,
<br/>opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is ar-
<br/>rested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady
<br/>had been buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed ;</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page370"/>
         </p>
         <p>and she was aroused, by the caresses of her lover, from the le-
<br/>thargy which had been mistaken for death. He bore her fran-
<br/>tically to his lodgings in the village. He employed certain
<br/>powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning.
<br/>In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She re-
<br/>mained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered
<br/>her original health. Her woman’s heart was not adamant, and
<br/>this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it
<br/>upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband, but con-
<br/>cealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to
<br/>America. Twenty years afterwards, the two returned to
<br/>France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the
<br/>lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize
<br/>her. They were mistaken, however; for, at the first meeting,
<br/>Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his
<br/>wife. This claim she resisted; and a judicial tribunal sus-
<br/>tained her in her resistance; deciding that the peculiar cir-
<br/>cumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished,
<br/>not only equitably but legally, the authority of the husband.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The “ Chirurgical Journal ” of Leipsic—a periodical, of
<br/>high authority and merit, which some American bookseller
<br/>would do well to translate and republish—records, in a late
<br/>number, a very distressing event of the character in question.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of ro-
<br/>bust health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, receiv-
<br/>ed a very severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him
<br/>insensible at once ; the skull was slightly fractured ; but no
<br/>immediate danger was apprehended. Trepanning was accom-
<br/>plished successfully. He was bled, and many other of the or-
<br/>dinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he
<br/>fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor ; and, final-
<br/>ly, it was thought that he died.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The weather was warm ; and he was buried, with indecent
<br/>haste, in one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place
<br/>on Thursday. On the Sunday following, the grounds of the 
<br/>cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with visiters; and,
<br/>about noon, an intense excitement was created by the declara- 
<br/>tion of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the offi- 
<br/>cer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the, earth, as if occa-
<br/>sioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little atten-
<br/>tion was paid to the man’s asseveration ; but his evident ter- 
<br/>ror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his 
<br/>story, had, at length, their natural effect upon the crowd.
<br/>Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was
<br/>shamefully shallow, was, in a few minutes, so far thrown open
<br/>that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then, seem-
<br/>ingly, dead ; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of
<br/>which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest Hospital, and
<br/>there pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic
<br/>condition. After some hours he revived, recognized individ-
<br/>uals of his acquaintance, and, in broken sentences, spoke of his
<br/>agonies in the grave.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>From what he related, it was clear that he must have been 
<br/>conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before 
<br/>lapsing into insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely 
<br/>filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was 
<br/>necessarily admitted. He heard the footsteps of the crowd 
<br/>overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. It was
<br/>the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which 
<br/>appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep—but no sooner
<br/>was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors
<br/>of his position.	</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This patient, it is recorded, was doing well, and seemed to 
<br/>be in a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the 
<br/>quackeries of medical experiment. The galvanic battery was </p>
         <p>applied ; and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic par-
oxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.
</p>
         <p>The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to
<br/>my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point,
<br/>where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a
<br/>young attorney of London who had been interred for two days.
<br/>This occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very pro-
<br/>found sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently,
<br/>of typhus fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms
<br/>which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants.
<br/>Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanc-
<br/>tion a post mortem examination, but declined to permit it. As
<br/>often happens when such refusals are made, the practitioners
<br/>resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in pri-
<br/>vate. Arrangements were easily effected with some of the
<br/>numerous corps of body-snatchers with which London abounds;
<br/>and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse
<br/>was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in
<br/>the operating chamber of one of the private hospitals.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>An incision of some extent had been actually made in the
<br/>abdomen, when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the
<br/>subject suggested an application of the battery. One experi-
<br/>ment succeeded another, and the customary effects superven-
<br/>ed, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except,
<br/>upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of
<br/>life-likeliness in the convulsive action.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was
<br/>thought expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissec-
<br/>tion. A student, however, was especially desirous of testing
<br/>a theory of his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to
<br/> one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was made, and a
<br/>wire hastily brought in contact; when the patient, with a
<br/>hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table,
<br/>stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily
<br/>for a few seconds, and then—spoke. What he said was unin-
<br/>telligible ; but words were uttered ; the syllabification was dis-
<br/> tinct. Having spoken, he fell heavily to the floor. </p>
         <p/>
         <p>For some moments all were paralyzed with awe—but the
<br/> urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of
<br/> mind. It was seen that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in
<br/> a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rap-
<br/> idly restored to health, and to the society of his friends—from
<br/>whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was with-
<br/>held, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their
<br/>wonder—their rapturous astonishment—may be conceived.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless,
<br/>is involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that
<br/>at no period was he altogether insensible—that, dully and con-
<br/>fusedly, he was aware of every thing which happened to him,
<br/>from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his
<br/> physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of
<br/> the Hospital. “ I am alive” were the uncomprehended words
<br/> which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room,
<br/> he had endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these
<br/>—but I forbear—for, indeed, we have no need of such to es-
<br/> tablish the fact that premature interments occur. When we
<br/> reflect how very rarely, from the nature of the case, we have
<br/> it in our power to detect them, we must admit that they may
<br/>frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth,
<br/>is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any
<br/>great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which
<br/>suggest the most fearful of suspicions.</p>
         <p>Fearful indeed the suspicion—but more fearful the doom !
It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so ter-
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page371"/>
         </p>
         <p>ribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of
<br/>mental distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable
<br/>oppression of the lungs—the stifling fumes from the damp
<br/>earth—the clinging of the death garments—the rigid embrace
<br/>of the narrow house—the blackness of the absolute Night—
<br/>the silence like a sea that overwhelms—the unseen but palpa-
<br/>ble presence of the Conqueror Worm—these things, with
<br/>thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear
<br/>friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate,
<br/>and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be in-
<br/>formed—that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead—
<br/>these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still
<br/>palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from
<br/>which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of
<br/>nothing so agonizing upon Earth—we can dream of nothing
<br/>half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. And
<br/>thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound ; an
<br/>interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the
<br/>topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon
<br/>our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I
<br/>have now to tell, is of my own actual knowledge—of my own
<br/>positive and personal experience.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For several years I had been subject to attacks of the sin-
<br/>gular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy,
<br/>in default of a more definitive title. Although both the imme-
<br/>diate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis,
<br/>of this disease, are still mysteries, its obvious and apparent
<br/>character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem
<br/>to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day
<br/>only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated
<br/>lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the
<br/>pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible ; some traces
<br/>of warmth remain ; a slight color lingers within the centre of
<br/>the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we
<br/>can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.
<br/>Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even for
<br/>months ; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous
<br/>medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between
<br/>the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute
<br/>death. Very usually, he is saved from premature interment
<br/>solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been pre-
<br/>viously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion ex-
<br/>cited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The
<br/>advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first mani-
<br/>festations, although marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow
<br/>successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for
<br/>a longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal
<br/>security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack
<br/>should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen,
<br/>would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>My own case differed in no important particular from those
<br/>mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any appar-
<br/>ent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of hemi-syn-
<br/>cope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, with-
<br/>out ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a
<br/>dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of
<br/>those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of
<br/>the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At
<br/>other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew
<br/>sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at
<br/>once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent,
<br/>and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could
<br/>be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however,
<br/>with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the
<br/>seisure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and house-
<br/>less beggar who roams the streets throughout the long deso-</p>
         <p>late winter night—just so tardily—just so wearily—just so
cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.
</p>
         <p>Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general
<br/>health appeared to be good ; nor could I perceive that it was
<br/>at all affected by the one prevalent malady—unless, indeed, an
<br/>idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as su-
<br/>perinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain,
<br/>at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always re-
<br/>mained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplex-
<br/>ity ;—the mental faculties in general, but the memory in
<br/>especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In all that I endured there was no physical suffering, but of
<br/>moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnal. I
<br/>talked “ of worms, of tombs and epitaphs.” I was lost in
<br/>reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held con-
<br/>tinual possession of my brain. The ghastly Danger to which
<br/>I was subjected, haunted me day and night. In the former,
<br/>the torture of meditation was excessive—in the latter, su-
<br/>preme. When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then,
<br/>with very horror of thought, I shook—shook as the quiver-
<br/>ing plumes upon the hearse. When Nature could endure
<br/>wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented
<br/>to sleep—for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I
<br/>might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally,
<br/>I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world
<br/>of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing
<br/>wings, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppress-
<br/>ed me in dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision.
<br/>Methought I was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more
<br/>than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly there came an
<br/>icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering
<br/>voice whispered the word “ Arise!” within my ear.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the
<br/>figure of him who had aroused me. I could call to mind nei-
<br/>ther the period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the
<br/>locality in which I then lay. While I remained motionless,
<br/>and busied in endeavors to collect my thoughts, the cold
<br/>hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,
<br/>while the gibbering voice said again :</p>
         <p>“ Arise ! did I not bid thee arise ?”
“ And who,” I demanded, “ art thou ?”
</p>
         <p>“ I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied
<br/>the voice mournfully; “ I was mortal, but am fiend. I was
<br/>merciless, but am pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder.—
<br/>My teeth chatter as l speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of
<br/>the night—of the night without end. But this hideousness
<br/>is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly sleep? I cannot
<br/>rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights are more
<br/>than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer
<br/>Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a
<br/>spectacle of woe ?—Behold !"</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I looked ; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by
<br/>the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all man-
<br/>kind; and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of
<br/>decay ; so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and
<br/>there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slum-
<br/>bers with the worm. But, alas! the real sleepers were fewer,
<br/>by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and
<br/>there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad
<br/>unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there
<br/>came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried.
<br/>And, of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a
<br/>vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the
<br/>rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been
<br/>entombed. And the voice again said to me, as I gazed :</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page372"/>
         </p>
         <p>“ Is it not—oh, is it not a pitiful sight ?”—but, before I
<br/>could find words to reply, the figure bad ceased to grasp my
<br/>wrist, the phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were clos-
<br/>ed with a sudden violence, while from out them arose a tu-
<br/>mult of despairing cries, saying again—“Is it not—oh, God !
<br/>is it not a very pitiful sight ?"</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night,
<br/>extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours.—
<br/>My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to
<br/>perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge
<br/>in any exercise that would carry me from home. In fact I
<br/>no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of
<br/>those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling
<br/>into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real
<br/>condition could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fide-
<br/>lity of my dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of
<br/>mere than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon
<br/>to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear
<br/>that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to con-
<br/>sider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for get-
<br/>ting rid of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to
<br/>reassure me by the most solemn promises. I exacted the
<br/>most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would
<br/>bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as
<br/>to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then,
<br/>my mortal terrors would listen to no reason—would accept no
<br/>consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions.
<br/>Among other things, I had the family fault so remodelled as
<br/>to admit of being readily opened from within. The slightest
<br/>pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb
<br/>would cause the iron portals to fly back. There were ar-
<br/>rangements also for the free admission of air and light, and
<br/>convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate
<br/>reach of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was
<br/>warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fash-
<br/>ioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition
<br/>of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body
<br/>would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there
<br/>was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the
<br/>rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole 
<br/>in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the 
<br/>corpse. But, alas! what avails the vigilance against the Des-
<br/>tiny of man ? Not even these well contrived securities sufficed 
<br/>to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a 
<br/>wretch to these agonies foredoomed !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived
<br/>—in which I found myself emerging from total unconscious-
<br/>ness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence.—
<br/>Slowly—with a tortoise gradation—approached the faint gray
<br/>dawn of the psychal day. A torpid uneasiness. An apathe-
<br/>thetic endurance of dull pain. No care—no hope—no effort.
<br/>Then, after long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after
<br/>a lapse still longer, a pricking or tingling sensation in the ex-
<br/>tremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable
<br/>quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are strug-
<br/>gling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity ;
<br/>then a sudden recovery. At length the slight quivering of an
<br/>eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a
<br/>terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents
<br/>from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive ef-
<br/>fort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And
<br/>now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory 
<br/>has so far regained its dominion that, in some measure, I am
<br/>cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from or-
<br/>dinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalep-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>sy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shud-
<br/>dering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the
<br/>one spectral and ever-prevalent Idea.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained
<br/>without motion. And why ? I could not summon courage
<br/>to move. I dared not make the effort which was to satisfy
<br/>me of my fate—and yet there was something at my heart
<br/>which whispered me it was sure. Despair—such as no other
<br/>species of wretchedness ever calls into being—despair alone
<br/>urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of
<br/>my eyes. I uplifted them. It was dark—all dark. I knew
<br/>that the fit was over. I knew that the crisis of my disorder
<br/>had long passed. I knew that I had now fully recovered the
<br/>use of my visual faculties—and yet it was dark—all dark—
<br/>the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth
<br/>for evermore.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue
<br/>moved convulsively together in the attempt—but no voice is-
<br/>sued from the cavernous lungs, which, oppressed as if by the
<br/>weight of some incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated,
<br/>with the heart, at every elaborate and struggling inspiration.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, show-
<br/>ed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I
<br/>felt, too, that I lay upon some hard substance ; and by some-
<br/>thing similar my sides were, also, closely compressed. So
<br/>far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs—but now I vi-
<br/>olently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length,
<br/>with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden sub-
<br/>stance, which extended above my person at an elevation of not
<br/>more than six inches from my face. I could no longer doubt
<br/>that I reposed within a coffin at last.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the
<br/>cherub Hope—for I thought of my precautions. I writhed,
<br/>and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid : it would
<br/>not move. I felt my wrists for the bell-rope : it was not to be
<br/>found. And now the Comforter fled forever, and a still stern-
<br/>er Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving
<br/>the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared
<br/>—and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong
<br/>peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I was not within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while
<br/>absent from home—while among strangers—when, or how, I
<br/>could not remember—and it was they who had buried me as a
<br/>dog—nailed up in some common coffin—and thrust, deep, deep,
<br/>and forever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the inner-
<br/>most chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud.
<br/>And in this second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and
<br/>continuous shriek, or yell, of agony, resounded through the
<br/>realms of the subterrene Night.</p>
         <p>“ Hillo ! hillo, there !” said a gruff voice in reply.
“ What the devil's the matter now I” said a second.
“ Get out o’ that!” said a third.
</p>
         <p>“ What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style,
<br/>like a cattymount ?” said a fourth ; and hereupon I was seiz-
<br/>ed and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a
<br/>junto of very rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse
<br/>me from my slumber—for I was wide awake when I screamed
<br/>—but they restored me to the full possession of my memory.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Ac-
<br/>companied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expe-
<br/>dition, some miles down the banks of James River. Night
<br/>approached, and we were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of
<br/>a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with
<br/>garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We
<br/>made the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page373"/>
         </p>
         <p>one of the only two berths in the vessel—and the berths of a
<br/>sloop of sixty or seventy tons, need scarcely be described.
<br/>That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind. Its ex-
<br/>treme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its bottom
<br/>from the deck overhead, was precisely the same. I found it a
<br/>matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Never-
<br/>theless, I slept soundly ; and the whole of my vision—for it
<br/>was no dream, and no nightmare—arose naturally from the
<br/>circumstances of my position—from my ordinary bias of thought
<br/>—and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collect-
<br/>ing my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a
<br/>long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook
<br/>me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to
<br/>unload it. From the load itself came the earthy smell. The
<br/>bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had
<br/>bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.</p>
         <p/>
         <p> The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite
<br/>equal, for the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were
<br/>fearfully—they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil
<br/>proceeded Good ; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an
<br/>inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired tone—acquired tem-
<br/>per. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I breathed 
<br/>the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than
<br/>Death. I discarded my medical books. “ Buchan ” I burn-
<br/>ed. I read no “ Night Thoughts ”—no fustian about church-
<br/>yards—no bugaboo tales—such as this. In short, I became a
<br/>new man, and lived a man's life. From that memorable night.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I dismissed forever my charnal apprehensions, and with them
<br/>vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had
<br/>been less the consequence than the cause.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason,
<br/>the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of
<br/>a Hell—but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore
<br/>with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of
<br/>sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful—
<br/>but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his
<br/>voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour</p>
         <p>us—they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.

LETTER TO THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
My Dear Journal,
</p>
         <p>You know my boy Bob? I mean that great double jointed
<br/>fellow whose countenance is concealed in a matting of beard
<br/>and whiskers ; the same of whom somebody- remarked that he
<br/>seemed to place great confidence in capillary attraction. He
<br/>is gone. Like Absalom his own hair has ruined him—and like
<br/>Absalom’s father, I can exclaim, “ my son ! my son !”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The circumstances are these. For a long time he has been
<br/>nursing his beard, and kept a small Dutch looking-glass before
<br/>him, which, when no customer claimed his attention, he was
<br/>ever combing, brushing, and making the most extraordinary
<br/>serio-ludicrous faces that can be imagined. A little drawer
<br/>under the counter was constantly supplied with candle-ends—
<br/>not gathered, as I in my simplicity supposed from motives of
<br/>economy ; but to grease his whiskers withal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>At length, matters began to grow serious. Ho could not be
<br/>induced to give attention to any but the female customers,
<br/>The men bought their wares elsewhere ; and even the women
<br/>seemed to think him dangerous. Miss Sally Jones said he
<br/>was a good likeness of Orson—and Mrs. Gollyhoggin, being
<br/>in an interesting state of health, and entering the shop just as
<br/>Bobby was turning around towards the counter, was so much
<br/>alarmed that the major threatened to sue mo for damages.</p>
         <p>Resolved to bear this no longer, I ordered him to shave.
</p>
         <p>The next morning he did not appear in the shop, and upon in-
<br/>quiry I found that he was gone. In the hope of finding some
<br/>clew to the place of his retreat, I examined his chamber and
<br/>found various books and papers belonging to a set of fellows
<br/>calling themselves Barbati, or some such outlandish name, of
<br/>whom my poor deluded boy was, it seems, the secretary.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It appears by the record of their proceedings, which were
<br/>deemed of sufficient importance to be noted in a journal, that
<br/>they had a Constitution ; and I send you a copy of it, word for
<br/>word.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Since the known paths to distinction have become crowded
<br/>to such a degree that those who toil up the dangerous steep
<br/>are almost all, sooner or later, precipitated into the abyss of
<br/>oblivion, which every where opes its unsatiate jaws for its
<br/>prey ; it is the part of the wise to hew out some new road that
<br/>may lead to glory with less labor and with less hazard.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Moved by these considerations, we have maturely pondered
<br/>the interesting theme. We have considered the great in their
<br/>eminence—we have seen every eye upturned to admire them,
<br/>and every hand eagerly outstretched to catch what might fall
<br/>from them—wc have seen even the intellectual immunditia of
<br/>these demigods garnered as treasures and preserved as holy
<br/>things—wc have seen exhibited as relics of inestimable value,
<br/>the absurdities of Demosthenes—the coxcombry of Alexander
<br/>the truisms of Franklin—and the bloodguiltiness of Draco, the
<br/>more deserving of execration that it was entailed upon pos-
<br/>terity. Nay, we have known even the insane ravings of our own
<br/>most contemptible political Jehus, to be listened to with all the
<br/>reverence formerly paid to the paltering trivialities of a Delphic
<br/>oracle. We are taught to admire the King of Macedon as a
<br/>groom—to read with intense interest that one great man delight-
<br/>ed in crumpets, and another luxuriated on cauliflowers—that one
<br/>was born with teeth, and another had a hitch in his gait.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have considered all these things and determined to be
<br/>great—not, however, by toiling up the rugged steep. We will
<br/>rise to notoriety by an easy, well graduated road. Spencer,
<br/>Petersham, Nash and Brummel have built themselves monu-
<br/>ments of wearing apparel; and Stultz has achieved nobility by
<br/>the same easy path. Mesmer, Dee, Nostradamus, Law, Per-
<br/>kins, Gall, Lavater,* still live as the fathers, grandfathers and
<br/>great grandfathers of quackery—and Sam Patch is not dead—
<br/>he who suggested the startling proposition that “ some things
<br/>can be done as well as other things”—and died to prove it—
<br/>whereby he liveth.</p>
         <p>We too, will become great; and by a simple and easy pro-
cess—we will, by our beards ! Fiat.
We do therefore combine and unite ourselves into a Society
to be intituled
</p>
         <p>Capricornorum Barbatorum SOCIETASt which name is
<br/>never to be known but to the initiate ; the letters C. B. S.
<br/>alone being given to the admiring world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>On public occasions, and at all meetings of the C. B. S.
<br/>each member shall wear a broad ribbon at his left button-hole,
<br/>whereon shall be plainly embroidered the letters S. B. C. S.
<br/>meaning Socius Barbatus Capricornorum Societatis, tt
<br/>which shall be known to the members only.</p>
         <p>The beards of all the members shall be of one length and
fashion, to be fixed by law.
The President, by way of distinction, shall wear no beard.
At the meetings it shall be the duty of the society first to
debate on the subject of beards, their antiquity, history, ex-
* Of course we do not father the opinions of our correspondent.

pression, cultivation, and their influence, physical and moral,
on society in general—2nd. To eat stewed oysters.”
</p>
         <p>“ Resolved that the thanks of this society be presented to
<br/>Athanasius Wollop, Esq. the high-minded honorable Princi-
<br/>pal of Appletree Academy for his unparalleled exertions in pre-
<br/>paring this Constitution, and that the members of this society
<br/>take every means of recommending his school to the public.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It appears by the record of these proceedings, that a warm
<br/>contest arose on that part of the Constitution which relates to
<br/>the President’s beard. The leader of one party alleged that
<br/>to prevent the President from wearing a beard would invest
<br/>him with a power fraught with danger to the permanence of
<br/>the institution. Another objected to the proposed regulation on
<br/>the ground that it was a vested right and therefore unconsti-
<br/>tutional.</p>
         <p>Here five members sprang to their feet, and the chairman
caught the eye of Mr. Wiggles—
</p>
         <p>Mr. Wiggles wished to know what gentlemen meant by a
<br/>vested right. If it meant a right to wear a vest, then all men
<br/>except savages and brutes, were entitled to it. Indeed he
<br/>himself, simple and unpretending as he stood there, had seen
<br/>a monkey wear a vest—yes—and a coat—and even a pair of
<br/>breeches ! He would maintain this right to the utmost of his
<br/>poor abilities. “ What sir,” said Mr. Wiggles, “ deprive a
<br/>man of a right to wear a vest!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Major Peter Perks rose to say that the able and eloquent
<br/>harangue made by the honorable gentleman who spoke last,
<br/>was predicated—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Interrupted by Mr. Wiggles who denied that his remarks
<br/>had been predicated. He would consider it personal if such
<br/>a thing were insinuated in regard to him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Perks would pass over the language used by the gentle-
<br/>man, because it was founded upon a misapprehension. He
<br/>meant to say that a vested right was not a right to wear a vest.
<br/>It was a right which every man had to do what he likes with
<br/>his own property. For example, said Mr. P. if a man chooses
<br/>to invest his money in stocks, or cravats, or collars, has he not
<br/>a right to do so, and then to burn them if he thinks proper ?—
<br/>The first named article is bought and sold ; for people buy and
<br/>sell stocks by thousands of pounds worth at a time ; and who
<br/>will be so bold as to deny their right. Now, sir, though it is
<br/>clear that every man has a right to his vested rights, yet this
<br/>must not be understood as applying to the case of a President.
<br/>It is well known that man is prone to abuse power ; and as so
<br/>high an officer as a President is more obnoxious to this vice
<br/>than any one else, so it should not only be denied to him, but
<br/>he should also be deprived of his rights—nay, more sir, of
<br/>his vested rights. I am, sir, a people’s man—a friend of the
<br/>people—and therefore opposed to giving any power to any
<br/>body—and if it should ever happen that I have the honor to
<br/>be elected President of the United States, I’ll let the people
<br/>see what my views are. If any man should propose to give
<br/>me or any one else any power, I’ll hang him, sir.” [Loud cheers.</p>
         <p>The resolution was finally adopted.
</p>
         <p>Mr. Tips proposed that all beards should be perfumed; but
<br/>it was rejected on the ground that the natural odour was the
<br/>best. Mr. Tiberius Gracchus Riggs—puer emunctae naris—
<br/>rose in behalf of those whose beards had not yet grown. He
<br/>thought it unreasonable that they should be fined for not wear-
<br/>ing a beard ; provided due diligence was shown to be used in
<br/>shaving and oiling.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Tiffy thought that the question “ whether a beard could
<br/>or could not be made to grow on a gentleman’s chin,” was not
<br/>to be discussed here. It would be unjust to make a law that did
<br/>not apply alike to all. Every member must have a beard,
<br/>whether he could or not. It was democratic.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Riggs thought this a very absurd proposition—and said
<br/>that he would not pay the fine ; nor would he withdraw from
<br/>the society. He had as much right to membership as any
<br/>body ; and he would render inoperative (so far as it concerned
<br/>himself,) all laws which did not suit him ; and take the benefit
<br/>of these which were agreeable to him.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>When he (Mr. Riggs joined the society, he did it with the
<br/>purpose and with the expectation of deriving from it the
<br/>greatest possible advantage—but this end would not be at-
<br/>tained if he was to be subjected to any inconveniences. He
<br/>intended to gain—not to lose. If the society were to resolve
<br/>itself into a committee of the whole and attempt to levy the
<br/>fine, he (Mr. R.) would boldly enter into the contest, and do
<br/>such deeds of noble daring, that the raging tempest would
<br/>pause to hear the tale and the whole earth would tremble at his
<br/>name.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>These extracts will suffice to exhibit the character and de-
<br/>signs of the Society. I trust, sir, that you will give them to
<br/>the public, with such observations of your own as may tend to
<br/>bring to their senses the Socii Capricornorum Barbatorum Soc.</p>
         <p>Yours,
PATER HAEDI.
WOMAN—THE HAREEM.
Thus in the ever-closed hareem,
As in the open Western home,
Sheds womanhood her starry gleam
Over our being's busy foam.
Through latitudes of varying faith,
Thus trace we still her mission sure,
To lighten life, to sweeten death,
And all for others to endure.
R. M. Milnes.
</p>
         <p>On entering a strange country, its women are the first objects
<br/>of interest to the moralist as well as to the epicurean; to the
<br/>former, because the education of a people, and the framework
<br/>of its society, depend mainly upon maternal and domestic cha-
<br/>racter: to the latter, because almost every grace and chaim of
<br/>daily life is owing to her influence, or interwoven with her
<br/>being—“ On a dit, qu’il y a de la femme dans tout ce qu’on
<br/>aime.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Among the lower classes of all nations, especially in the
<br/>country, the life and habits of women approximate more or less
<br/>to that of men in an inverse proportion to their civilisation. As
<br/>they share with the ruder sex their labors, hardships, and daily
<br/>occupation, among savage tribes almost the only distinction
<br/>between the sexes is physical. It is of the Moslem woman of
<br/>the middle and upper classes that I am now about to speak,
<br/>and I do so with a diffidence proportioned to such mysterious
<br/>matters.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Difficult a study as woman presents in all countries, that dif-
<br/>ficulty deepens almost into an impossibility in a land where even
<br/>to look upon her is a matter of danger or of death. The seclu-
<br/>sion of the hareem is preserved in the very streets by means
<br/>of an impenetrable veil; the well-bred Egyptian averts his
<br/>eyes as she passes by ; she is ever to remain an object of
<br/>mystery; and the most intimate acquaintance never inquires
<br/>after the wife of his friend, or affects to know of her existence.*
<br/>This very mystery, however, piques the often-baffled inquirer;
<br/>and between Europeans, who have become almost Egyptian,
<br/>and Egyptians who have become almost European, one is able
<br/>to obtain some information even on this delicate subject.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Eastern woman seems as happy in her lot as her Euro-
<br/>pean sister, notwithstanding the plurality of wives in which her
<br/>lord indulges, or ventures upon. In her “ public opinion’s law”
<br/>there is no more disparagement in occupying the second place
<br/>as a wife, than there is in Europe as a daughter. The man-
<br/>ners of patriarchal ages remain in Egypt as unchanged as its
<br/>monuments; and the people of Cairo think as little of object-
<br/>ing to a man's marrying a second wife, as those of Memphis of
<br/>questioning the legitimacy of Joseph. The Koran, following
<br/>the example of the Jewish doctors, only allows four wives to
<br/>each Mussulman, and even of this limited allowance they sel-
<br/>dom avail themselves to its fullest extent. Some hareems</p>
         <p>• If alluded to at all by other lips than those of her proprietor, or writ-
ten to, it is as “ the guarded lady,”—“ the concealed jewel.”—LANE.
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page375"/>
         </p>
         <p>contain two hundred females including wives, mothers-in-law,
<br/>concubines, and the various slaves belonging to each; but
<br/>these feminine barracks seem very different from what such
<br/>establishments would be in Europe. In the hareem there is
<br/>as much order and decorum as in an English quaker’s home :
<br/>it is guarded as the tiger guards his young; but its inmates
<br/>consider this as a compliment, and fancy themselves neglected
<br/>if not closely watched. This cause for complaint seldom oc-
<br/>curs, for the Egyptian has no blind confidence in the strength
<br/>of woman’s character, or woman’s love. He holds to the
<br/>aphorism of Mahomet in this matter, “ if you set butter in
<br/>the sun it will surely melt;” and considers it safer, if not
<br/>more glorious, to keep her out of the reach of temptation, than
<br/>to run the chance of her overcoming it when exposed to its
<br/>encounter.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Born and brought up in the hareem, women never seem to
<br/>pine at its imprisonment: like cage-born birds, they sing among
<br/>their bars, and discover in their aviaries a thousand little plea-
<br/>sures invisible to eyes that have a wider range. To them, in
<br/>their calm seclusion, the strifes of the battling world come
<br/>softened and almost hushed; they only hear the far-off mur-
<br/>mur of life’s stormy sea, and, if their human lot dooms them
<br/>to their cares, they are as transient as those of childhodd.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Passing through the secluded suburbs of Cairo, I once found
<br/>myself near one of the principal hareems; I paused by the dull,
<br/>dark wall, over which the palm-tree waved, and the scent of
<br/>flowers and the bubbling of fountains stole ; and there I listen-
<br/>ed to the sweet laughter of the Odalisques within. This was
<br/>broken by snatches of untaught song, to which the merry un-
<br/>seen band joined chorus, and kept time by clapping hands, on
<br/>which their jewelled bracelets tinkled. It was a music of
<br/>most merry mirth ; and as I pictured to myself the gay group
<br/>within, I wondered whether they deserved all that pity from
<br/>their European sisters which they so little appreciate. An
<br/>English lady, visiting an Odalisque, inquired what pleasure her
<br/>profusion of rich ornaments could afford, as no person except
<br/>her husband was ever to behold them: “ and for whom,” re-
<br/>plied the fair barbarian, “ do you adorn yourself? is it for other
<br/>men?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I have conversed with several European ladies who had
<br/>visited hareems, and they have all confessed their inability to
<br/>convince the Eastern wives of the unhappiness or hardship of
<br/>their state. It is true that the inmate of the hareem knows
<br/>nothing of the advantages of the wild liberty (as it seems to
<br/>her) that the European woman enjoys: she has never witness-
<br/>ed the domestic happiness that crowns a fashionable life, or the
<br/>peace of mind and purity of heart that reward the labors of a
<br/>London season ; and what can she know of the disinterested
<br/>affection and changeless constancy of ball-room belles, in the
<br/>land where woman is all free. Let them laugh on in their hap-
<br/>py ignorance of a better lot, while round them is gathered all
<br/>that their lord can command of luxury and pleasantness : his
<br/>wealth is hoarded for them alone; he permits himself no
<br/>ostentation, except the respectable one of arms and horses;
<br/>and the time is weary that he passes apart from his home and
<br/>his hareem. The sternest tyrants are gentle there; Mehemet
<br/>Ali never refused a woman’s prayer; and even Ali Pasha was
<br/>partly humanized by his love for Emineh. In the time of the
<br/>Mamelukes, criminals were led to execution blindfolded, be-
<br/>cause if they had met a woman and could touch her garment,
<br/>they were saved, whatever was their crime. Thus idolized,
<br/>watched, and guarded, the Egyptian woman’s life is, neverthe-
<br/>less, entirely in the power of her lord, and her death is the in-
<br/>evitable penalty of his dishonor. No piquant case of crim. con.
<br/>ever amuses the Egyptian public: the injured husband is his
<br/>own judge and jury; his only “ gentlemen of the long robe”
<br/>are his eunucbs; and the dagger or the Nile the only damages.
<br/>The law never interferes in these little domestic arrange-</p>
         <p>ments.
</p>
         <p>Poor Fatima! shrined as she was in the palace of a tyrant,
<br/>the fame of her beauty stole abroad through Cairo. She was
<br/>one amongst a hundred in the hareem of Abbas Pasha, a man
<br/>stained with every foul and loathsome vice; and who can won-
<br/>der, though many may condemn, if she listened to a daring
<br/>young Albanian, who risked his life to obtain but a sight of her?
<br/>Whether she did listen or not, none can ever know, but the
<br/>eunuchs saw the glitter o the Arnaut’s arms, as he leapt from
<br/>her terrace into the Nile and vanished in the darkness. The
<br/>following night, a merry English party dined together on board</p>
         <p>of Lord E-----’s boat, as it lay moored off the Isle of Rhoda ;
conversation had sunk into silence, as the calm night came on;
a faint breeze floated perfumes from the gardens over the star-
</p>
         <p>lit Nile, and scarcely moved the clouds that rose from the
<br/>chibouque; a dreamy languor seemed to pervade all nature,
<br/>and even the city lay hushed in deep repose—when suddenly
<br/>a boat, crowded with dark figures among which arms gleamed,
<br/>shot out from one of the arches of the palace ; it paused un-
<br/>der the opposite bank, where the water rushed deep and
<br/>gloomily along, and for a moment a white figure glimmered
<br/>amongst the boat’s dark crew; there was a slight movement,
<br/>and a faint splash—and then the river flowed on as merrily as
<br/>if poor Fatima still sang her Georgian song to the murmur of
<br/> its waters.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I was riding one evening along the banks of the Mareotis;
<br/>the lowland, half swamp, half desert, was level as the lake;
<br/>there was no sound except the ripple of the waves along the
<br/>far extended shore, and the heavy flapping of the pelican’s wings,
<br/>as she rose from the water’s edge. Not a palm-tree raised its
<br/>plumy head; not a shrub crept along the ground ; the sun was
<br/>low, but there was nothing to cast a shadow over the mono-
<br/>tonous waste, except a few Moslem tombs with their sculptur-
<br/>ed turbans : these stood apart from every sign of life, and even
<br/>of their kindred dead, like those upon the Lido at Venice. As
<br/>I paused to contemplate this scene of desolation, an Egyptian
<br/>hurried past me wiih a bloody knife in his hand; his dress was
<br/>mean and ragged, but his countenance was one that the father
<br/>of Don Carlos might have worn; he never raised his eyes as
<br/>he rushed by; and my groom, who just then came up, told me
<br/>he had slain his wife, and was going to her father’s village to
<br/>denounce her.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>My boat was moored in the little harbor of Assouan, the old
<br/>Syene, the boundary between Egypt and Ethiopia; opposite,
<br/>lies Elephantina, the “ isle of flowers,” strewed with ruins,
<br/>and shaded by magnificent palm-trees; the last eddies of the
<br/>cataract of the Nile foam round dark red granite cliffs, which
<br/>rise precipitously from the river, and are piled into a mountain
<br/>crowned by a ruined Saracenic castle. A forest of palm-trees
<br/>divides the village from the quiet shore on whose silvery sands
<br/>my tent was pitched. A man in an Egyptian dress saluted me
<br/>in Italian, and in a few moments was smoking my chibouque,
<br/>and sipping coffee by my side : he was very handsome; but
<br/>his faded cheek and sunken eye showed hardship and suffer-
<br/>ing, and he spoke in a low and humble voice. In reply to my
<br/>question, as to how a person of his appearance came into this
<br/>remote region, he told me that he had been lately practising
<br/>as a surgeon in Alexandria; he had married a Levantine girl,
<br/>whose beauty was to him as “ la faccia del cielo:"he had
<br/>been absent from his home, and she had betrayed him. On
<br/>his return, he met her with a smiling countenance; in the
<br/>evening he accompanied her to a deep well, whither she went
<br/>to draw water, and, as she leant over it, he threw her in. As
<br/>he said this, he paused, and placed his hands upon his ears, as
<br/>if he still heard her dying shriek. He then continued : “ I
<br/>have fled from Alexandria till the affair is blown over : I was
<br/>robbed near Siout, and have supported myself miserably ever
<br/>since, by giving medical advice to the poor country people : I
<br/>shall soon return, and all will be forgotten. If I had not
<br/>avenged myself, her own family, you know, must have done
<br/>so.” And so this woman-murderer smoked on, and continued
<br/>talking in a low and gentle voice till the moon was high; then
<br/>he went his way, and I saw him no more.</p>
         <p>From the Crescent and the Cross.

         <p>Niblo’s Garden—This favorite and delightful place of amuse-
<br/>ment opened last week. The performances are of a light and
<br/>pleasing character, in admirable accordance with the genius of the
<br/>place. The company is good, numbering among its members
<br/>Messrs. Chippendale, Sefton, &amp;c., &amp;c.—Miss Taylor, Miss Math-
<br/>ews, Mrs. Watts and others. In the dancing department, Miss
<br/>Partington and Celeste are well known and highly popular, while
<br/>too young debutantes, Misses Deloriel and Nathalie are striving for
<br/>popular favor. They are singularly pretty, light, graceful and well-
<br/>formed ; they dress beautifully, and give promise in their style of
<br/>dancing, of much future excellence. The band is excellent; Mr.
<br/>Marks wielding the baton with his accustomed firmness and grace.
<br/>The house has been well filled every night, and if novelties are
<br/>produced, we feel sure that this will prove a profitable season to
<br/>Mr. Niblo.	_______</p>

REVIEWS.
An Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy, No. 4: Harper &amp;
Brothers.
</p>
         <p>Though the present number of this excellent work is less
<br/>profusely illustrated with cuts than those that have preceded it.
<br/>it is the most valuable of all, being occupied chiefly with the
<br/>subject of food, of which it treats very fully and discreetly.
<br/>Something like thirty pages of the two last numbers are occu-
<br/>pied by matter relating to domestic servants, which is mainly
<br/>calculated to produce more harm than good in this country.
<br/>The author of this department of the Encyclopaedia has entered
<br/>into the ethics and aesthetics of servitude with great gravity,
<br/>and a marvellously elevated tone of thought. He begins his
<br/>essay, paragraph 1432, in this impressive manner:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Domestic servants are a class in society no less essential to its
<br/>welfare and convenience than the equivalent in subsistence and
<br/>money which, for service done, that class receives, is essential
<br/>to the well-being of each individual belonging to it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We doubt whether this has been written by a gentleman who
<br/>has ever had the honor, personally, to officiate as a domestic
<br/>servant of any kind, although in his description of what a ser-
<br/>vant should be, he manifests a very minute acquaintance with
<br/>the duties of a foot-boy, scullion, &amp;c. His picture of a nurse
<br/>is particularly edifying; he has drawn the character of a more
<br/>perfect monster than can be found in any novel:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In person a nurse should have no striking peculiarity or de-
<br/>formity ; no habitual tricks with the features, such as squint-
<br/>ing or grimaces; no defect in the articulation, such as lisping
<br/>and stammering; no singularity or vulgarity in the tone or ac-
<br/>cent ; for such peculiarities always brings into exercise the imi-
<br/>tative propensities of childhood. In stature the middle size is, for
<br/>a nurse, preferable to either extreme of tall or short; the one
<br/>often causing deficiency in activity, the other in muscular power.
<br/>The constitution of a nurse maid should be sound. Tendencies
<br/>to humors of any kind, to consumption, to rheumatism, or even
<br/>being liable to frequent headaches, would detract from the per-
<br/>sonal fitness of an individual for the duties of the nursery. In
<br/>age the nurse should be neither very old, nor very young ; were
<br/>she old, she might possibly be very deficient in activity and
<br/>temper; were she too young, she might want consideration and
<br/>judgment. In disposition, she should be cheerful even to liveli-
<br/>ness, yet, withal, gentle. Boisterous gayety in the nurse would
<br/>be almost as injurious to her infant charges as a temper of irri-
<br/>tability and violence. In the situation and duties of a nurse
<br/>there is much to try the temper; and it is not reasonable to ex-
<br/>pect that it should be always unruffled : still, no one is fit for
<br/>the charge of children who cannot control in herself any violent
<br/>expression of irritation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Inpersonal habits the nurse should be scrupulously correct.
<br/>Cleanliness and neatness are not to be dispensed with in the
<br/>individual who is to lay the foundation of good habits in the
<br/>objects of her superintendence. Deficiency in such habits can,
<br/>in her, only arise from indolence ; and if this defect be inculca-
<br/>ted in childhood, by the force of her example, it may, being the 
<br/>parent of so many other vices, blight the promise given in the 
<br/>first years of life of the exercise of future mental vigor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But, after all, no personal nor acquired qualification in the
<br/>nurse can be put in competition with the all-important requisite
<br/>of vigorous, effective, and virtuous principles.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Here is a greater amount of high qualities required in a
<br/>nurse than would be exacted from a Prime Minister, or a Chief 
<br/>Justice. Turning to the table of wages, we find that the pay 
<br/>of such an angel as is described above, varies from twenty to
<br/>thirty pounds per annum, while the dress required for such an
<br/>admirable form, every article of which is particularly named,
<br/>(petticoats 12s, body linen 6s, &amp;c.&amp;c.,) amounts to £7.8.0 sterl-
<br/>ing per annum.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The duties of each servant are very fully detailed ; we select
<br/>the article on a “ footman,” as a sample, from which it will be
<br/>seen that his office is by no means a sinecure.</p>
         <p>He must rise early, and endeavor to get some of the roughest
part of his work done before his breakfast, and before he is re-
</p>
         <p>quired to appear in the breakfast-room. In order to preserve
<br/>the cleanliness of his clothes, he should be provided with a com-
<br/>plete overall suit, made of materials that will easily brush clean
<br/>or bear washing. Covered over with these, he brushes the
<br/>clothes of the gentlemen of the family, then cleans and polish-
<br/>es their boots and shoes, which the night before, if wet or damp,
<br/>he had placed at a proper distance from the fire, to dry them
<br/>gradually: an attention which enables him afterwards to give
<br/>them a finer polish. These done and set ready to convey to
<br/>their owners, he then cleans the knives and forks, wipes them,
<br/>and puts them away till wanted. After this he washes and
<br/>cleans himself previously to the preparations for the family
<br/>breakfast table. After laying the cloth and placing the required
<br/>number of cups, saucers, plates, &amp;c., he puts the heater into the
<br/>kitchen fire, sees that water is boiling, and the supplies of
<br/>bread, butter, &amp;c. ready, and then is prepared for the summons
<br/>for the urn. His own breakfast time is regulated by that of the
<br/>family, the footman in some houses taking breakfast with the
<br/>other servants, and in others in his own pantry on the remains
<br/>of the family breakfast.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After the footman has himself breakfasted,washed and replaced
<br/>in the china closet whatever has been used of china at the break-
<br/>fast table, together with the plate, waiters and trays, he must di-
<br/>rect his attention to the cleaning of candlesticks (see “ Clean-
<br/> ing”), trimming of lamps, (see “ Artificial Illumination,”), put-
<br/> ting them in right places in his pantry till they are wanted.—
<br/>The mahogany furniture in the dining-room or library he must
<br/> rub daily , and twice weekly he ought to wash away any spots
<br/> it may have acquired, restoring afterward the polish it may have
<br/> lost, by any of the means mentioned under “ Cleaning.” Some
<br/> of the windows he should clean weekly, availing himself of
<br/> periods of the day when the occupants of the rooms are absent
<br/> from them. Afterward returning to the pantry, he should set
<br/>himself to prepare something or other for the dinner table ;
<br/>either to rub the plate, to wipe the glass, &amp;c., until it be time to
<br/>prepare for the luncheon. During this part of the day he should
<br/>be in such a dress as is not inconsistent with his employments,
<br/>nor yet unfit for him to appear in if summoned by bells to the
<br/>parlor or to the hall door. A colored cotton or plain cloth jack-
<br/>et and white linen apron are usually worn by footmen while en-
<br/>gaged as above described. The parlor luncheon being general-
<br/>ly called for about one o’clock, he must have the tray set ready;
<br/>when carried into the parlor, and properly arranged, he will
<br/>usually be at liberty to get his own dinner, which is generally
<br/>ready at this period of the day. When his mistress requires it,
<br/>the footman should be ready to attend her, either with the car-
<br/>riage, or to follow her if she walks out. For this latter part of
<br/>his morning’s duty, he should be neatly dressed ; his clothes and
<br/>hat should be well brushed ; his shoes and stockings and gloves
<br/>clean. A dirty looking footman is a disgrace rather than a
<br/>credit to a family. In giving directions to the coachman he
<br/>should be quick and accurate; nor is it altogether needless to
<br/>remark that, even in his announcing rap at the doors of the
<br/>parties on whom his lady calls, there is a propriety to be observ-
<br/>ed as to its measure and degree; if too loud and long, it disturbs
<br/>a whole neighborhood; if too insignificant, it may be deficient
<br/>in respect to his lady. In following her during her walks, he
<br/>should preserve a steady decorum of manner, and be observant
<br/>and ready in case any emergency should make his aid necessary
<br/>to her.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Waiting at table is one of the most important parts of his em-
<br/>ployments, and requires more skill and attention from him, if
<br/>unaided by others, than when he is one among many attendants.
<br/>Here, any neglect of his other duties will be apparent, and the
<br/>censure must fall on him alone. Knives, forks, plate, and
<br/>glass will all tell of his industry or of his negligence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The general deportment of a footman, while waiting at din-
<br/>ner, should bo quiet and quick, but not hurried or bustling : he
<br/>should tread lightly, change plates, knives,, &amp;.c. without clatter,
<br/>and should speak as little as possible, and never in a raised tone
<br/>of voice, unless it be necessary in answering questions. He
<br/>should hand everything with the left hand, and to the left of the
<br/>person he is assisting to anything. The tablecloth, in remov-
<br/>ing, should have each side and ends lightly thrown together, and
<br/>be carried out of the room, and laid aside until a convenient
<br/>opportunity for shaking it and folding it up. On formal occa-
<br/>sions, the tablecloth is left, and long slips down each side art
<br/>used, and removed when dinner is over. It should be wrapt up
<br/>in the folds previously made, and placed carefully in the table-
<br/>linen press. Dinner over, and the dessert and wine properly
<br/>placed on the table, the footman retires to his own pantry to
<br/>wash glasses, &amp;c.., and to put everything once more in its right</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page377"/>
         </p>
         <p>place. Then he prepared for taking up coffee and tea; puts the
<br/>urn heater into the fire; places teacups, &amp;c., on the board; and
<br/>sets cakes, bread and butter, milk, &amp;c. on his waiter, ready to
<br/>carry to the drawing-room when required. At night he closes
<br/>all window-shutters and locks up doors ; carries up bed candles;
<br/>takes the slippers to his master; and, lastly, collects, as far as
<br/>he can, all small articles of plate, such as teaspoons, which are
<br/>in constant dispersion during the day in most houses ; counts
<br/>all over ; locks it up or places it in security—and thus closes
<br/>his daily business.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To place candles properly in the candlesticks, though not
<br/>strictly a branch of cleaning generally, completes this part of
<br/>the footman’s work. Candles should be placed perfectly straight
<br/>in the candlestick ; any inclination from the perpendicular being
<br/>not only disagreeable to the eye, but causing the tallow or wax
<br/>to run wastefully down the sides, because the heat of the flame
<br/>acts more powerfully on one side of the candle than on the oth-
<br/>er. The same effect is produced by dirt or soil on the surface
<br/>of the candle, as also causing an irregular action of the heat.
<br/>If the nozzle of the candlestick be too large for the candle, a
<br/>small fold of paper must be put round the candle, not so wide
<br/>as to be visible when the candle is placed in it. The wick of
<br/>the candles, if they have not been previously lighted, should 
<br/>be just set fire to and blown out. For this, when they are 
<br/>wanted, they will light the more easily.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In trimming candles which have been previously in use, it is 
<br/>desirable to pare off the top, so far as to form again the conical 
<br/>shape into which they had been originally moulded. The object
<br/>of this is to prevent that surplus of melted tallow, caused by
<br/>the heating of so large a circumference of tallow, and which
<br/>the wick cannot at first consume, from flowing down the sides
<br/>of candles, wasting as well as disfiguring them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Candle ends, mould as well as wax, ought to be used upon
<br/>save-alls by the servants, and not put into the box of scrapings,
<br/>to add to the perquisites of those whose office it is to clean the
<br/>candlesticks.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For these trifling services and every day accomplishments,
<br/>the footman receives from 10 to 25 pounds per annum, which 
<br/>will not be considered too much when it is seen that he must
<br/>have the nanners of a perfect gentleman, and the gallantry of
<br/>an old chevalier, besides being six feet in his stockings, and the
<br/>owner of good teeth and broad shoulders.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But the most interesting of all to a great part of American
<br/>readers, will be the description and list of duties assigned to a 
<br/>“ maid of all work,” that kind of servant being the most com-
<br/>mon in American families.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>First, she must be an early riser; before her mistress gets
<br/>up, her kitchen, parlor, and hall should be properly cleaned (see
<br/>art. “ Cleaning,”), and she herself washed and neatly dressed,
<br/>ready to attend on her mistress and prepare her breakfast, taking
<br/>her own also about the same time. After breakfast, and after 
<br/>washing and putting away the breakfast things, and receiving
<br/>her mistress’s orders for the day, she should repair to the bed-
<br/>rooms, and proceed to clean and arrange them, as described
<br/>above (see “ Household Duties”) From these employments it
<br/>is probable that she may be oacasionally called away to answer
<br/>bells; and, on such occasions, she should look to her kitchen
<br/>fire now and then, to keep it in readiness for the cooking, to
<br/>which she will, in a short time, have to attend. When up-stairs
<br/>work is done, she must return to her kitchen, and set about
<br/>preparing the dinner. In some cases, the mistress may, per-
<br/>haps, assist her. It will be an advantage to the servant to have
<br/>such an assistant and instructress who may be clever in the
<br/>art of cooking.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Before dinner is served she should again wash her hands and
<br/>change her apron, making her dress as seemly as the nature of
<br/>her employments permit. In a service such as the one now de- 
<br/>scribed, the family usually dine first, and the servant afterward,
<br/>on the remains of the dinner. As she brings it from table she 
<br/>should put it near the fire to keep it warm until she has time to 
<br/>sit down to it. If she does her duty to her employer, she may
<br/>conscientiously attend to any little circumstances that may pro-
<br/>mote her own comfort.	</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Her dinner over, the clearing away, scouring saucepans, 
<br/>washing dishes, with every other necessary act of cleanliness, 
<br/>will occupy some part of the afternoon, in the course of which 
<br/>she must find time to make up the kitchen fire, set on the tea-
<br/>kettle, and sweep up the kitchen hearth. Her work completed, 
<br/>she again washes herself and changes her dress; she is then </p>
         <p>ready to wait upon her mistress at tea, and to attend in any oth-
er way to her comfort.
The evening is occupied with closing doors and windows,
and arranging the bedrooms for the night.
</p>
         <p>Besides the daily routine, she must contrive to bring into each
<br/>day some portion of the weekly cleaning. Her kitchen should
<br/>be scoured twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday; the par-
<br/>lour swept every other morning; the hall washed; bedrooms
<br/>swept, and carpets taken up and shaken on Tuesday and Fri-
<br/>day ; plate cleaned on Wednesday and Saturday; block tin kitch-
<br/>en utensils, plated candlesticks, and brass work on Thursday
<br/>(see “ Cleaning".) Once a fortnight or once in three weeks,
<br/>the floors of bedrooms should be scoured (see “Scouring”.) marks
<br/>on painted wainscots washed off, windows cleaned, &amp;c.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If the washing be done in the house, the above routine will be
<br/>occasionally broken into for a few days, though probably she
<br/>will be allowed some assistance at the washtub, and will find
<br/>her mistress ready to take on herself some portion of the light-
<br/>er business of starching and getting up the fine linen.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The young lady who performs these duties well, and is more-
<br/>over virtuous, cheerful and good looking, may hope for seven
<br/>pounds per annum, and tea and sugar.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The whole of the article on domestic servants is very pleas-
<br/>ant reading, if not very profitable on this side of the Atlantic,
<br/>and the description of a gentleman’s household reads like a
<br/>chapter from a fashionable novel.</p>

<br/>ly exhibited. Walker’s Sheridan has been long objectionable,
<br/>of course ; for during the last fifty years the advance of litera-
<br/>ture, and more especially of science, has introduced into the
<br/>language a vast number of words which had no existence at
<br/>the period of the compilation of that work. It contains only
<br/>about 33,000 words, and the Dictionary now before us includes
<br/>no less than 85,000—“ 20,000 more than were ever offered to
<br/>the American public in any one work”—this, too, exclusive of
<br/>more than 20,000, Greek, Latin, Scripture, Christian, and
<br/>Geographical proper names. Walker’s volume, moreover,
<br/>was essentially defective in its pronunciation, from a similar
<br/>reason—that is to say, from the lapse of time since its com-
<br/>position, and the important changes sanctioned by usage during
<br/>the interval. The 100,000 words furnished by Mr. Bolles,
<br/>are divided into syllables, with the pronunciation of each given
<br/>phonographically according to Sheridan’s rules, but with an
<br/>absolutely rigorous application of them. Where the usage is
<br/>settled, it has been scrupulously followed: where not, resort
<br/>has been had to analogy and classical authority.</p>
         <p>Sheridan's rules were as follows :
</p>
         <p>No character should be set down in any word which is not
<br/>pronounced. Every distinct simple sound should have a dis-
<br/>tinct character to mark it, for which it should uniformly stand.
<br/>The same character should never be set down as the repre-
<br/>sentative of two different sounds. All compound sounds should
<br/>be marked only by such characters as will naturally and ne-
<br/>cessarily produce those sounds, upon their being pronounced
<br/>according to their names in the alphabet.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>These rules are theoretically perfect, but the pronouncing
<br/>dictionaries in use have invariably failed in carrying them into
<br/>practice. Sheridan and Walker make no scruple, for example,
<br/>of presenting to the eye letters for which no sound is heard.
<br/>Mr. Bolles, in his Preface, furnishes us with some specimens
<br/>of this error. The pronunciation of the word courteous, is, in
<br/>Sheridan, kur'-tshus—inWalker, kur'-tshe-us—and in Bolles,</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page378"/>
         </p>
         <p>kort-yus. The last is indisputably the truest both as regards
<br/>the phonographical distinctness with which the intended
<br/>sounds are conveyed, and the more modern and polished pro-
<br/>nunciation of the word itself.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The orthography of Dr. Johnson has been followed, in our
<br/>opinion very properly, throughout; except “ in cases where
<br/>custom has decidedly sanctioned a change for the better, as in
<br/>the omission of u in the termination our and of final k, pre-
<br/>ceded by c, in words derived from the learned languages, etc.
<br/>etc.” We quote this last passage from Mr. Bolles, because
<br/>we fully agree with him that custom has sufficiently establish-
<br/>ed the orthographies in question, however much we may be
<br/>inclined to dispute, in many cases, the justice or propriety of
<br/>the custom.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Bolles has admitted obsolete words when they are to
<br/>be found in authors not obsolete, “ or when they have any form
<br/>or beauty that may deserve revival." His reason for admitting
<br/>them when found in authors not obsolete is, with some modi-
<br/>fication, unanswerable. “ Indeed,” he says, “ the vocabulary
<br/>of an explanatory English Dictionary would be exceedingly
<br/>defective, in which one should look in vain for words occurring
<br/>in such authors as Bacon, Boyle, Shakspeare, Milton, &amp;c.,
<br/>while their works constitute a portion of the standard litera-
<br/>ture of the language.” It should be observed, however, that
<br/>it is only in the case of such as Bacon, Boyle, Shakspeare and
<br/>Milton, that the lexicographist is justifiable in applying this
<br/>rule. Innumerable obsolete words may be found “ in authors
<br/>not obsolete,” which words, nevertheless, it would be folly
<br/>to attempt resuscitating. We mean to say that Mr.
<br/>Bolles’ proposition is, in his Preface, too loosely or too gene-
<br/>rally stated. In fact, that is to say in the body of his work,
<br/>we perceive that he has confined his revivals within the pro-
<br/>per limits—confined them to such authors as are emphatically
<br/>standard. He has included, however, a vast number of words
<br/>now regarded as obsolete—although we by no means think he
<br/>has improperly included them. He promises an abridgment
<br/>in which they will be omitted.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In regard to rules of pronunciation, we cannot do better than
<br/>quote the author’s own words, with which in the main, we
<br/>heartily agree.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ These rules are so multitudinous, and the exceptions to
<br/>almost all of them so numerous, that it is believed that in a
<br/>work of this nature they tend more to embarrass than to aid
<br/>the inquirer, and that however useful these troublesome ap-
<br/>pendages may be in works where the pronunciation is omitted
<br/>or loosely given, they are rendered useless by the plan of this
<br/>dictionary, in which the pronunciation of any word can be
<br/>much more readily and certainly ascertained by a bare in-
<br/>spection than by a reference to rules almost smothered amid
<br/>their own anomalies.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>With these judicious views Mr. Bolles has contented him-
<br/>self with an introductory exposition of the principles on which
<br/>Human Speech is founded—(a well written and altogether
<br/>valuable paper)—some Directions to Foreigners (particularly
<br/>the French)—and a few rules to be observed by the natives of
<br/>Ireland and Wales, in order to attain a just pronunciation of
<br/>English.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If, upon the whole, we cannot regard this work as the most
<br/>profoundly vague word often vaguely applied) we are at least
<br/>disposed to consider it the most comprehensive, the most ac-
<br/>curate, and by far the most practical—that is to say the most
<br/>useful of its class.</p>
         <p>Its typographical execution is excellent. It is for sale, we
understand, at the exceedingly moderate price of three dollars.

         <p>We are informed that Mr. Cornelius Matthews is not the author
<br/>of the article in the North American Review which recently ap-
<br/>peared in Simms' Magazine. It was signed with the initials of
<br/>Mr. M., but Simms was himself the author.</p>
         <p>The Dramatic Authors of America. By James Rees. Phila-
delphia: G. B. Tilber &amp; Co., 1845.
</p>
         <p>This is a very curious and a highly profitable little work for
<br/>the student of American literature. It is probable that no
<br/>other man in the country has sufficient love for the Drama to
<br/>enable him to gather together so many forgotten facts in re-
<br/>lation to this subject as Mr. Rees has done in this little book.
<br/>The Dramatic Authors of America ! How many could the
<br/>most learned man among us enumerate ? Perhaps a dozen.
<br/>Very many American scholars would doubtless have to think
<br/>a while before naming even one. Yet Mr. Rees has mustered
<br/>a regiment here of no less than one hundred and eighty-eight,
<br/>thirty-four of them being anonymous. Some of these authors
<br/>have produced as many plays as Shakspeare, while a good
<br/>many have produced but one. And yet, among the whole
<br/>of their Dramas, there are not more than three or four that
<br/>keep their place upon the stage. A literary gentleman remark-
<br/>ed the other day that he did not know any body who had not
<br/>written a word; after looking over Mr. Rees’s catalogue of
<br/>Dramatists we could not readily remember any body who had
<br/>not written a play. Mr. Rees evidently undertook his task
<br/>con amore, and doubtless made his list as complete as he could,
<br/>but he has made four omissions within our knowledge, and
<br/>doubtless many beyond it. So that we may safely estimate
<br/>the Dramatic Authors of the United States, or of Alleghania,
<br/>at two hundred, and giving them three plays a piece, which
<br/>must be within the mark, the Alleghanish Drama must amount
<br/>to at least six hundred plays. John Neal is the anthor of a
<br/>five act tragedy called Otheo. Mr. Edward S. Gould is the
<br/>author of a tragedy founded on the history of Richard Cour
<br/>de Lyon, which was successfully represented at the Park theatre
<br/>about fifteen years since, and Cornelius Matthews is the au-
<br/>thor of a five act comedy called the Politicians, which we be-
<br/>lieve has never been produced at any theatre. Mr. Rees has
<br/>not included either of these dramatic authors in his catalogue.
<br/>Probably Mr. Griswold will include these and many more of
<br/>whom the country has never heard, in his forth-coming book
<br/>on American prose writers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Notwithstanding the complaints that we hear continually
<br/>from the denizens of the theatre, about the decline of the le-
<br/>gitimate drama, there seems to be a very decided love for
<br/>dramatic compositions among our educated men as well as
<br/>among the lower classes, from whom the theatre derives its
<br/>principal support.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The wife of a popular tragedian in New York says, that
<br/>they always tremble when the door bell rings; expecting the
<br/>apparition of a dramatic author with a manuscript tragedy to
<br/>follow as a matter of course. She says that they have had a
<br/>large chest constructed in their garret for the express purpose
<br/>of keeping manuscript tragedies. Where there is so much
<br/>smoke it would not be unreasonable to expect some fire;
<br/>but the American Drama does not appear to promise sufficient
<br/>heat to produce combustion. Mrs. Mowatt has recently “fired
<br/>up,” to a certain extent; but whether she has produced a real
<br/>flame or only an ignis fatuus remains to be seen. One thing is
<br/>very certain, that no art can flourish in a country when it is
<br/>not countenanced by the better classes of society, and it can-,
<br/>not be denied that the theatre derives no aid, with us, from
<br/>the learned, the wealthy, or the professedly religious. All
<br/>classes of society read the Wandering Jew, and everything
<br/>that comes from Dickens; doctors of low, divinity and medi-
<br/>cine read such works and place them in their libraries; but
<br/>these people never visit the theatre let the attraction be what it
<br/>may. Let half-a-dozen D. Ds be seen in the pit of the Park
<br/>Theatre, and we should not only see their congregations fol-
<br/>lowing them, but we should see our men and women of genius</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page379"/>
         </p>
         <p>exerting their talents for the amusement and instruction of
<br/>such fit audiences. One of the last things that we could ever
<br/>do would be to recommend, or countenance idle and vicious
<br/>amusements, but no amusement which requires so great a va-
<br/>riety of artistic excellence as the drama, ever could be vicious
<br/>or injurious if it were countenanced by those who assume the
<br/>office of public teachers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Whether the theatre be a disreputable place, as conduct-
<br/>ed at present, is not a point which we need debate about; the
<br/>theatre exists and is likely to exist, and to exert an exten-
<br/>sive influence of some kind in the commnnity, and the only
<br/>consideration should be, with good men, whether it would be
<br/>better to leave it to grow in its enormities, or by giving it their
<br/>countenance, convert it into a blessing instead of a curse to the
<br/>people. There is no objection among good people to pictures,
<br/>none to music, none to wit and humor, none to rhetoric; but
<br/>the drama is nothing more than these united. Instead of going
<br/>on separate nights to witness each department of art by itself,
<br/>in the theatre they may see them happily assembled to produce
<br/>an effect. The fault of the false position which the drama
<br/>holds does not lie so much with the better classes of society, as
<br/>with the managers of theatres themselves; if these will make
<br/>brothels and drinking houses of their theatres they have no
<br/>right to complain when respectable people refuse to patronise
<br/>them. The reform must begin in the theatre, and when that
<br/>has been effected, we have no doubt that it will extend to those
<br/>without. The appearance of so respectable a person as Mrs.
<br/>Mowatt on the stage, we trust, will not be without a purifying
<br/>effect upon the atmosphere of the play-house.</p>
         <p>NEW WORKS LATELY RECEIVED.
</p>
         <p>Vathek. With a Biographical Sketch of the Author. No. 1 of the
<br/>New Series of the Mirror Library. Published by Morris, Willis
<br/>&amp; Fuller, pp. 50. Price 25 cents.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We are very glad to see a new series of the Mirror Library,
<br/>and to weleome Vathek in No. 1. The “biographical sketch
<br/>of the author” however, is a misnomer: the gossiping recollec-
<br/>tions of Mr. Redding by no means form a biography, and we
<br/>would be glad to see some of the productions of Beckford sub-
<br/>stituted in their place; the Memoirs of the Old Painters for
<br/>instance. The biography of Beckford is a good subject for a
<br/>philosophical or a fanciful writer, and it is a matter of surprise
<br/>that none of his countrymen have yet made an attempt on
<br/>his “life.” Mr. Redding’s recollections are very agreeable
<br/>reading for hot weather, but he was too much impressed by
<br/>the externals which surrounded Vathek to be able to form a
<br/>cool judgment of his character. The book is neatly got up,
<br/>of a size to correspond with the first series of the Mirror Li-
<br/>brary.</p>
         <p>Self. By the Author of “Cecil." New York: Harper Sc
Brothers.
</p>
         <p>“ Cecil" was one of the most popular novels ever published
<br/>in England, and produced, on its first appearance, scarcely
<br/>less sensation than “ Vivian Grey," or “ Pelham,” to both
<br/>which, however, it has a strong family resemblance. It has
<br/>more spirit—more dash—more abandon—and infinitely more
<br/>impudence than either: taking qualities, all of these, with the
<br/>public. Its learning, too, was seemingly prodigious, and it was
<br/>difficult (for this and other reasons) to believe it the work of a
<br/>woman. Mrs. Gore was, nevertheless, well understood to be
<br/>the author—although it has been asserted that she received aid,
<br/>in the bespicing of the book with scraps of pedantry, from a
<br/>well-known scholar and litterateur of London. This we do</p>
         <p/>
         <p>not believe—nor is there any sufficient reason for believing it.
<br/>In the first place, had any such aid been given, it must have
<br/>been given after the composition by Mrs. Gore, and traces of
<br/>interpolation would have inevitably remained:—none such
<br/>are apparent. In the second place, all the former productions
<br/>of the authoress evince the same species of apparent erudi-
<br/>tion—an erudition which is only apparent, and carefully intro-
<br/>duced to serve a purpose. True erudition is only certainly
<br/>discoverable in its entire results. There is nothing in any-
<br/>thing written by Mrs. Gore, which is not within the reach of
<br/>any decently educated person of ingenuity, having access to
<br/>the large libraries of London. The same thing may be said
<br/>even of that remarkable work, “ The Doctor,” and of a great
<br/>many other similar publications.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Self” has all the principal traits of “ Cecil,” and is, per-
<br/>haps, a more entertaining book upon the whole—although its
<br/>subject does not offer so many facilities. We recommend it
<br/>heartily to all persons troubled with ennui.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Waverly Novels, by Sir Walter Scott: with the author’s
<br/>latest corrections and additions. Complete in five volumes
<br/>(3340 pages) for two dollars and fifty cents. Philadelphia:
<br/>Carey &amp; Hart.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The general title of this work, as we give it above, includes
<br/>all necessary information respecting it. A greater amount of
<br/>valuable and interesting reading was never furnished for the
<br/>same money. The contents of the second volume (just
<br/>issued) are The Heart of Mid-Lothian ; The Bride of Lam-
<br/>mermoor; The Legend of Montrose ; Ivanhoe; The Mon-
<br/>astery ; and The Abbott. The New York agents are Burgess,
<br/>Stringer &amp; Co., W. H. Graham, aud Saxton Sc Miles.</p>
         <p>Veronica; or The Free Court of Aarau. Translated from the
German of Zschokke, by the Author of Giafar Al Barmeki.
</p>
         <p>This is number 51 of Harper’s “ Library of Select Novels.”
<br/>Zschokke, of late, has become popular in America, to an ex-
<br/>tent which neither his intrinsic merit nor his foreign reputa-
<br/>tion would appear to justify. We would not undervalue his
<br/>genius, (if genius it can be called,) but we mean to say that
<br/>there are numerous Germans whose works might be trans-
<br/>lated to better purpose. “ Veronica” is not the least interest-
<br/>ing of his novels—but the author of “Giafar Al Barmeki”
<br/>has himself written a far better original thing, and we would
<br/>urgently advise him to leave the task of translation to those
<br/>who have no capacity for anything else.</p>
         <p>TRANSLATION OF AN ODE OF SAPPHO.
Blest as the immortal gods is he
On whom each day thy glances shine;
Who hears thy voice of melody.
And meets thy smile so all divine.
Oh, when I list thine accents low
How thrills my breast with tender pain—
Fire seems through every vein to glow,
And strange confusion whelms my brain.
My sight grows dim beneath the glance
Whose ardent rays I may not meet,
While swift and wild my pulses dance.
Then cease all suddenly to beat.
And o’er my cheek with rapid gush,
I feel the burning life-tide dart;
Then backward like a torrent rush
All icy cold upon my heart.
And I am motionless and pale,
And silent as an unstrung lyre;
And feel, while thus each sense doth fail,
Doomed in thy presence to expire.

THE NEW OPERA AT PHILADELPHIA.
</p>
         <p>According to our expressed intention we visited Philadel-
<br/>phia for the purpose of being present at the performance of
<br/>Mr. Fry’s “ Leonora.” The production of a grand Opera,
<br/>composed by a resident American, was an event which, we be-
<br/>lieve, fully warranted some extraordinary outlay upon our
<br/>part, in order to present to our readers a faithful account of the
<br/>character of the work. Fully aware of all the difficulties at-
<br/>tendant upon the production of a new Opera by a new hand,
<br/>we went prepared for all the annoyances on the stage and in
<br/>the orchestra, consequent upon a first performance, or rather a
<br/>last dress rehearsal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Chesnut Theatre was crowded in every part; the boxes
<br/>presented an array of beauty and fashion but rarely congregat-
<br/>ed together at one time ; and if the fair ladies of our sister city-
<br/>are to be judged by the various specimens then before us, we
<br/>should say that a feeling of “ brotherly love ” towards them
<br/>would prove a dangerous experiment.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The plot of the Opera is no other than Bulwer’s Lady of
<br/>Lyons. Most of our readers are familiar with the action of
<br/>that play. One or two characters are omitted, and Claude's
<br/>mother in the play, is changed to Julia’s sister in the Opera.
<br/>No other material alteration is made, if we except the change
<br/>in the locality and the time, which are transferred from Lyons
<br/>to Spain—from the eighteenth to the sixteenth century. The
<br/>reader will, however, bear the first of these changes in mind,
<br/>as the entire truthfulness and fitness of the music turns upon it.
<br/>The characters are as follows : Leonova, daughter of Valdor,
<br/>Mrs. Seguin ; Mariana, sister of Julio, Miss F. Ince ; Julio,
<br/>a peasant, Mr. Frazer; Montalao, a gentleman of rank, Mr.
<br/>Seguin ; Valdor, a rich merchant, Mr. Richings; Alferez, a
<br/>gentleman, Mr. Brunton. The overture consists of a maesto-
<br/>so movement, an agitato, and we believe, an andante move-
<br/>ment with the usual repetitions. No one portion of the over-
<br/>ture was striking either for its originality or its beauty. We
<br/>listened in vain for some phrase which should develope a
<br/>thought or suggest an idea ; it was simply a succession of mo-
<br/>tivi, as applicable to one thing as to another. Much blame
<br/>must be laid to the very defective instrumentation ; no one
<br/>subject came out clearly ; the brass and wood instruments
<br/>were used injudiciously; effects were sought after by violent
<br/>and repeated contrasts, by phrases given to the full brass and
<br/>echoed by the wood, headed by the piccolo-flute—now the whole
<br/>subject would be full to repletion, and now thin to attenuation.
<br/>We did not hear a single point in which the character of one
<br/>of the orchestral instruments was developed. The violincelli
<br/>were used as common basses ; the violas as common fiddles ;
<br/>and the fagotti did only general work. Such is the general
<br/>character of the instrumentation throughout the Opera.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The opening chorus is a bold and spirited melody and will
<br/>in all probability, from its familiar character, be whistled about
<br/>the streets. Montalao’s first song is “ King Death was a rar -
<br/>old fallow." This song as composed by Chevalier Newkomn
<br/>is universally known, and what could have induced Mr. Fry
<br/>to introduce it into his Opera, unless to suggest comparison,
<br/>we are at a loss to conceive. Comparisons will be drawn and
<br/>to his disadvantage, for the first phrases of his version prove,
<br/>beyond a doubt, that Newkom’s fine song was fresh in his
<br/>memory, and suggested, if not supplied, the thought. The in-
<br/>troduction of the chorus is, however, cleverly managed and ex-
<br/>ceedingly effective The air “ No Haughty Maiden,” has a
<br/>most charming florid accompaniment, and is without doubt, the
<br/>most pleasingly instrumented piece in the Opera.</p>
         <p>In the second scene, the first scena is chiefly remarkable for
the very bad effect produced by the accompaniments of the
stringed instruments with mutes (con Sordini.) The air “ Grant
me one only hour ” is nothing, if not Bellini.
</p>
         <p>The Recitative and Air, “ Ah canst thou bid me smother,”
<br/>is certainly a very charming composition. The melody par-
<br/>takes somewhat of the Spanish character and is sad and im-
<br/>passioned. This air is thc most natural burst of genuine feel-
<br/>ing in the opera. It was chastely and expressively sung by
<br/>Mr. Frazer. The oboe solo which preceded the song was
<br/>played in a most masterly and exquisite manner by Mr. Kellner.
<br/>We must compliment this gentlemen upon his performance
<br/>throughout; it was the only thing worthy to he remembered
<br/>amidst the vast orchestral chaos. Mr. Kellner would do credit
<br/>to any orchestra.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The next point of consequence we arrive at, is the chorus—
<br/>“ Who can be this youthful stranger ?” The subject is deci-
<br/>dedly clever, but it is elaborated to an absurd extent, and the
<br/>changes towards the close are vexatious and unmeaning—a
<br/>striving hard for something, and nothing thereby achieved.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Julio’s following recitative is good and the aria is pleasing,
<br/>but it is spun out to a ridiculous extent—the subject being re-
<br/>peated, with intervening symphonies, three times. This is ex-
<br/>ceeding his Italian model with a vengeance.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The finale to the first act “ Oh ! moment too enchanting”
<br/>is marked Bolero, to which it bears as much resemblance as a
<br/>Tyrolean movement can bear to a Spanish Bolero. It is very
<br/>florid, and afforded Mrs. Seguin every opportunity for a lull
<br/>display of her executive power.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The bridesmaid's chorus which opens the second act is a
<br/>very pretty Tyrolean. The melody is flowing, and seemed to
<br/>catch the ear of the audience for it was warmly applauded.
<br/>The duett between Julio and Leonora is so long, and consists
<br/>of so many movements, that it is impossible to speak as posi-
<br/>tively of it as we could wish. The first movement we noted
<br/>as exceedingly good—a succeeding movement as borrowed
<br/>without reserve, and another as clever in the extreme. The
<br/>remainder of the scene presents but little worthy of particular
<br/>notice, if we except the voluntary upon the Seraphine which
<br/>was remarkable only for its utter want of thought and ingenuity,
<br/>and for the pumping effects with the pedal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The ballad by Mariana which opens the second scene is a
<br/>very pleasing little trifle and was very well received. Miss
<br/>Ince, though lacking a musical education, possesses a pleasing
<br/>voice and natural simplicity of manner, which take well with
<br/>the public.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are several pleasing melodies, and one or two credit-
<br/>able concerted pieces, in the remainder of this act, and in the
<br/>last act, but, though we would willingly notice them separate-
<br/>ly, want of space compels us to draw this notice to a
<br/>close.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To bring our remarks into a small compass we should say
<br/>that although there are some very pleasing morceaux in the
<br/>Opera, it is, beyond a doubt, wanting in originality of thought,
<br/>is deficient in profundity, and possesses very little, if any, dra-
<br/>matic action. As a Spanish Opera it must be considered an
<br/>irredeemable failure, as the composer never knew, or entirely
<br/>mistook the characteristics of the Spanish school. We wish
<br/>to be correctly understood. It is generally conceded that the
<br/>great emotions which agitate the human heart—love, hatred,
<br/>jealousy and revenge, demand no conventional mode of ex-
<br/>pression—they owe to no rule their intensity of feeling ; they
<br/>speak in a language which is universal, and whether it be the
<br/>Spaniard or the Englishman, the Italian or the German, these
<br/>emotions spring right up from the heart and are dependent for
<br/>the truthfulness of expression upon the genius or inspira-
<br/>tion of the composer. John Barnett, to be sure, in the Moun-
<br/>tain Sylph and Boildieu, in La Dame Blanche, have succeeded</p>

         </p>
         <p>in imparting to ths larger portion of the music of these operas, 
<br/>the distinctive characteristics of the music of the land in which
<br/>the action of the libretto is laid. But the rule is not absolute.
<br/>There is a rule, however, which is never departed from by
<br/>composers of any talent—a rule so natural that it must suggest
<br/>itself to every reflecting mind. It is, that all ballads, dances
<br/>and simple chorusses, should be purely and entirely national.
<br/>The national music of every country is faithfully portrayed in 
<br/>its ballads and dances, and if these do not partake of the na-
<br/>tional character, the scene might as well be laid in Russia as
<br/>in France, or in China as in Spain. Mr. Fry has, therefore,
<br/>in this important feature, entirely failed. The music of Lea-</p>
         <p>nora has, indeed, no distinctive character—no idiosyncracy—it
</p>
         <p>is simply music without relevancy to time or place. There is
<br/>another and a fatal fault to be noticed ; a fault which Mr.
<br/>Fry, knowing the voices he had to write for, should not have
<br/>fallen into.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The music is too high both for the soprano and tenor. Both
<br/>Mrs. Seguin and Mr. Frazer are taxed beyond their power
<br/>and compass, and the effect throughout is strained and painful.
<br/>The music, if published as written, would be beyond the com-
<br/>pass of all but operatic singers. The Instrumentation is still
<br/>the weakest part of the composition. We should have judged
<br/>it to have been a very early attempt of a young writer. Want
<br/>of clearness in design, outre effects and injudicious combina-
<br/>tions, with a general poverty of conception, are the leading
<br/>characteristics presented by the partition. We feel certain
<br/>that the composer never imagined such effects as came out in
<br/>the orchestra. A man may be an admirable theorist in the
<br/>art of scoring, but if he has not had years of practical expe-
<br/>rience, his theories are not worth a jot—he may write a score
<br/>that will look well, but looks go for nothing when it comes
<br/>into the orchestra. A man never feels so childlike and help-
<br/>less as when he hears his first important score performed, and
<br/>finds bis beauties upon paper, different in every way from what
<br/>he expected. In short, books are worthless except for gen-
<br/>eral principles, and though Mr. Fry may have written a thou-
<br/>sand scores which he has never heard, we are sure that the
<br/>fact of hearing one of these, would have done more for his
<br/>improvement than years of blind labor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In conclusion, while commending the perseverance which
<br/>he has exhibited, we can only regret that he has so misapplied 
<br/>his labors. If, instead of following a hackneyed model which
<br/>has laid him open—and justly, too—to the charge of wholesale
<br/>plagiarism, he had bestowed the same amount of time in
<br/>working out a style of his own, something worthy of the labor
<br/>might have resulted therefrom ; but now, even allowing that
<br/>Leonora becomes popular, the composer will owe at least one
<br/>half to the school which he adopts, for in the servile imitations
<br/>of any school, striking similarities are entirely unavoidable,
<br/>and these similarities are almost certain to recall the promi-
<br/>nent and popular beauties of the school or composer followed,
<br/>and the public willingly receive the counterfeit for the sake of
<br/>the real.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We hoped that Leonora would have been the foundation of
<br/>an American school, but it is simply a weak copy of an origin-
<br/>al which is itself too weak to bear diluting. If Mr. Fry is
<br/>to become anything in the future, he must look with doubt upon
<br/>those who say, that this work ranks him with the greatest
<br/>composers of Europe. It is ignorant flattery or something
<br/>worse. We thought it injudicious in Mr. Fry, to say the least
<br/>of it, to inform the audience that the same amount of mental
<br/>labor, study, &amp;c., &amp;c., was given to the production of Leono-
<br/>ra, as the greatest composers of Europe usually bestowed up-
<br/>on their productions. Mr. Fry doubtless worked hard, and all
<br/>the credit due him should be awarded ; it should, however, be</p>
         <p>remembered that the dwarf labors, in proportion, as hard as the

</p>
         <p>giant, but the result of that labor is also in proportion. Of the
<br/>performance it would not be fair to judge hardly, for the re-
<br/>hearsals were altogether inadequate. Mrs. Seguin was, how-
<br/>ever, quite perfect, and her promptitude and steadiness fre-
<br/>quently retrieved the music from inextricable confusion. Mr.
<br/>Frazer has been harshly spoken of. This is unjust, as he en-
<br/>deavored to delay the performance of the Opera that he might
<br/>perfect himself in his part. The only wonder is, how he got
<br/>on as well as he did. His music was of immense length and
<br/>great difficulty ;—a man cannot study by steam, and therefore
<br/>the errors of Mr. Frazer should fall upon those who hurried
<br/>the Opera out.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The performance of the orchestra was bad beyond belief;
<br/>it would have been bad even, for sight playing, but for a per-
<br/>formance after having rehearsed the music, we cannot con-
<br/>demn it too severely.</p>
         <p>The getting up, scenery, dresses, &amp;c., &amp;c., was highly cred-
itable to the liberality of the managers.
We shall recur to this Opera again, probably in our next, as
we are now compelled to close abruptly from want of space.
MISCELLANIES.
</p>
         <p>The old Masters in England.—There were imported
<br/>into England, in the last five years, seventy thousand ancient
<br/>paintings. The sales at auction average over one thousand
<br/>a month of undoubted originals. During the months of April
<br/>and May, 2920 old masters were sold at the regular auction
<br/>marts. From these facts it is very evident that all the old
<br/>masters do not find their way, as some people suppose, into
<br/>the auction room of Mr. Levy.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A Passionate Lover of Flowers.—“ We want no better
<br/>evidence of a good heart than the passionate love of flowers,”
<br/>says the good-hearted Major Noah in his last Messenger; hut
<br/>we do. In passing a very beautiful flower-garden in the
<br/>neighborhood of New York, a week or two since, we made
<br/>a similar remark to a lady, who replied, “ it’s all stuff; I was
<br/>passing by this garden a few days since, and seeing the owner
<br/>of it trimming her flowers, I asked her to give me a pink out
<br/>of her border of carnations. ' I never give away my flowers,’
<br/>was the ' good-hearted’ response of this passionate lover of
<br/>flowers."</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We stated last week, on the authority of the Knickerbocker’s
<br/>correspondent at Constantinople, that the author of Eothen was
<br/>a gentleman named White: we had previously stated on the
<br/>authority of a London newspaper that his name was Trevi-
<br/>lian, we now learn from the author of the “ Crescent and the
<br/>Cross,” that the author of Eothen is a gentleman bearing the
<br/>handsome name of Kinglake. It is a new name and a good
<br/>one, and we shall not contend with it until the arrival of the
<br/>next steamer, when we shall probably hear of another one.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Profits of Novels.—During the last few years the
<br/>Parisian daily press had run down so low in circulation that
<br/>the plan of giving a novel in the feuilleton was adopted to
<br/>attract purchasers; when the united energies of political
<br/> writers and critics failed to interest the Parisian public, the
<br/>aid of the novelist was invoked, and successfully, to save them
<br/>from bankruptcy. In 1828, Lafitte bought one of the fifteen
<br/>shares of the Constitutionnel, for Messrs. Cauchoir, Lemaire
<br/>and Thiers, for which he paid one hundred thousand francs,
<br/>and three years ago the whole paper was sold for five thousand
<br/>pounds sterling, to Veron, a compeer of Thiers. The
<br/>" Presse” adopted the plan of giving a novel, which succeeded,</p>
         <p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page382"/>
         </p>
         <p>and then the “ Constitutionnel” engaged Eugene Sue, at the
<br/>enormous price of one hundred thousand francs. Le Juif
<br/>Errant was begun, and the sales of the paper rose to ten
<br/>thousand copies daily at once.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Improvements in Broadway.—There is considerable
<br/>tearing down and building up going on in our beautiful
<br/>thoroughfare, but the only alterations that we notice likely
<br/>to prove an improvement, are extensive excavations for the
<br/>foundation of a hotel next to Wiley &amp; Putnam’s, to be kept
<br/>by the famous Rathbone, of Buffalo, and the beginning of a
<br/>club-house and racketts-court, building by Mr. Carman,
<br/>opposite to St. Thomas’ Church, or. the shady side of Broad-
<br/>way. This novel building will extend through to Crosby-
<br/>street in the rear. The entrance to the Rev. Mr. Bellows’
<br/>church will be a handsome addition in that part of the street.
<br/>It is of red sand-stone, of the fashionable Gothic order.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Among the places worth visiting in Broadway, is the shop
<br/>of George Chester, at 392, who has some of the most
<br/>beautiful specimens of stained glass that we have seen in any
<br/>of our decorative warehouses.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Poetry or Europe.—By Longfellow.—The first
<br/>volume of this collection of poetry has just been issued. It is
<br/>a very large book, neatly printed, with a portrait of Schiller,
<br/>and a very indifferent ornamental title page. It includes
<br/>none of the poetry of England, and but little of the poetry
<br/>of France. The translations are from a great variety of
<br/>sources, British and American. We hear that the professor
<br/>receives three thousand dollars for editing the work.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Spread of Alleghanianism.—A new sign has re-
<br/>cently been hung out in the upper part of Broadway, bearing
<br/>this startling inscription :—“ The Alleghanian. Best of
<br/>Liquors 3 cents per glass.” This is the most encouraging
<br/>sign for the Alleghanians that we have met with. An Alle-
<br/>ghanian “smasher” for 3 cents is cheap enough. The pro-
<br/>prietor will reckon, as a matter of eourse, on the entire patron-
<br/>age of the amateurs in national nomenclature.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The French Company also open at the Park next week. It is
<br/>unusually strong in every respect. The opening Opera will be La
<br/>Juive, by Helevy.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>M Huber, a violincellist of reputation, recently from Paris, is at
<br/>present in the city, and will give a concert as soon as the weather
<br/>moderates its colidity.</p>
         <p>Mr. Tryon opens the New Bowery Theatre on Monday, with a
vaudeville company.
OBITUARY.
J. R. BLEECKER.
</p>
         <p>We are pained to record the death of this promising young
<br/>painter, at the early age of 26. He died on the 5th inst., sifter a
<br/>protracted illness, of consumption. His loss is mourned by a large
<br/>circle of friends, who admired his genius, and loved him for his
<br/>generous and manly qualities. A kinder hearted man or a warmer
<br/>friend never lived. Most sincerely do we sympathize with his af-
<br/>flicted family in their bereavement. Mr. Bleecker was an amateur,
<br/>but he has left works of a high order of merit, which give evidence
<br/>of talents that would have placed his name among the first of
<br/>American painters. His paintings are admirable for great delicacy
<br/>of color, and beauty of conception, and for bold and original treat-
<br/>ment. He had a true perception of the picturesque and humorous
<br/>in character, and some of his efforts at their delineation were ex-
<br/>ceedingly happy. One of his last pictures, a very beautiful touch
<br/>of melancholy nature, representing a scene in October, when the
<br/>sky is growing cold, the clouds heavy, and the earth bare, is hung</p>
         <p>
</p>
         <p>in the exhibition of the National Academy. He was a true lover
<br/>of nature, and we shall look at his modest sketches with melan-
<br/>choly interest, now that his hand is cold in death.	r.</p>

         <p>“Eliot Warburton, who is known to be the author of these brilliantly
<br/>sparkling papers, the “ Episodes of Eastern Travel,” which lit up our
<br/>last November. His book (The Crescent and the Cross) must and will
<br/>be capital.”—Vide “ Eothen,” page 179.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“This delightful work is, from first to last, a splendid panorama of
<br/>Eastern scenery, in the full blaze of its magnificence. The crowning
<br/>merit of the book is, that it is evidently the production of a gentleman,
<br/>and a man of the world, who has lived in the best society, and been an
<br/>attentive observer of the scenes and characters which have passed before
<br/>him during his restless and joyous existence. To a keen sense of the
<br/>ludicrous, he joins a power of sketching and grouping which are happily
<br/>demonstrated.”—Morning Post.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ We could not recommend a better book as a travelling companion
<br/>than Mr. Warburton’s. Admirably written as is the work, and eminent-
<br/>ly graphic as are its descriptions, it possesses a yet more exalted merit
<br/>in the biblical and philosophical illustrations of the writer.”—United

         <p/>
         <p>“Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The
<br/>Realities’ of ‘ Eastern Travel’ are described with a vividness which in-
<br/>vest them with deep and abiding interest; while the ‘ Romantic’ ad-
<br/>ventures which the enterprising tourist met with in his course are
<br/>narrated with a spirit which shows how much he enjoyed these reliefs
<br/>from the ennui of every-day life.”—Globe.</p>

         <p>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he
<br/>has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old estab-
<br/>lishment in Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS
<br/>published on the continent without the heavy expense attending their 
<br/>transmission through England. Each of these establishments will be
<br/>conducted by one of his sons, under his own general superintendence.—
<br/>This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage to his
<br/>correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
<br/>on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and
<br/>small sums payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp;. Co. of New-York. Two and a
<br/>half percent will be allowed to all those who make a remittance with
<br/>their orders.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years,
<br/>possesses a knowledge of books and editions not often to be met with,
<br/>and will be happy to give any advice and information respecting the for-
<br/>mation of Libraries or Collections of Books in any particular branch of
<br/>literature or science. For information in regard to his efficiency, he
<br/>begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other lit-
<br/>erary characters in the United States, to whom he is known. Intending
<br/>to devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits, his greatest plea-
<br/>sure will arise from sending rare and valuable books to his own country;
<br/>and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States a Library
<br/>which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
<br/>he can live to say, “ I also assisted in its formation,” his most ar-
<br/>dent wishes will be gratified.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Rich has in press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova: a Cata-
<br/>logue of Books relating to America, including Voyages to the South
<br/>Seas and round the World : Part III. from 1831 to 1845, with supplement
<br/>and index completing the work.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He has also ready for the press, Bibliotheca Americana Vitus : a
<br/>Catalogue of Books relating to America from the discovery to the year
<br/>1700 ; with notes and observations: in one vol. 8 vo., of about 400 pages.</p>
         <p>Mr Rich has also ready a reprint from Thevenot’s Collection of Fath-

<br/>ject of the editor to combine science with practice, a knowledge
<br/>of principles with the ordinary details and daily recurring duties
<br/>of domestic life. In some departments of the work Mr. Webster
<br/>has been assisted by a lady whose qualifications are beyond dis-
<br/>pute, and the result of their united labors is the production of a
<br/>volume which exhausts the subject, and defies all competition.
<br/>The work is richly illustrated with woodcuts, adding greatly to
<br/>its value. We strongly recommend every lady, and all others who
<br/>are concerned in the management of domestic affairs, to make
<br/>themselves familiar with a work, which must speedily be regarded</p>
         <p>as an indispensable book of reference to every housekeeper.”—
Eclectic Review.
</p>
         <p>“ It is a perfect repository of all that homely knowledge which
<br/>is so difficult to obtain except in the hard school of experience, and
<br/>yet so needful for getting on in this matter-of-fact world. It would
<br/>be time and money admirably economized for housekeepers to pro-
<br/>vide themselves with this thesaurus of the way of living at the
<br/>outset.”—Churchman.</p>
         <p>	“ We consider it one of the most useful works ever issued from
 the American press, and strongly recommend it to all heads of
families.”—Rover.
	“ This is decidedly a book for the million; it contains all that
kind of precise information adapted to the use of families, and
which one may seek a long time for in vain elsewhere.”—N. Y.
Evening Gazette.
“ It contains a mass of information upon a thousand points, re-
specting which, most people find themselves sadly at fault, at
times. It is a work which cannot fail to prove highly useful.”—
Buffalo Advertiser.

         <p/>
         <p>“ The price of the whole book may be saved by the superior
<br/>information one may get from this very number, (the second,) and
<br/>the economy one may practise in consequence in buying a new
<br/>arm-chair or a pattent lamp.” -Morning Next.</p>

</p>
         <p>the public against a set of imposters who are calling upon our cus-
<br/>tomers, asserting that they are engaged by us in the capacity of agents.
<br/>In several instances they have succeeded in obtaining orders. But when
<br/>the goods are delivered great dissatisfaction has been given by the infa-
<br/>mous and utterly base imitations. But still persisting that the cards
<br/>are our manufacture, they too often succeed in foisting them upon the

<br/>that, should they persist after this notice, we will try what effect a State

BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p>
         <p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this
<br/>method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<br/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises,
<br/>scules and studies are given in such progressive order, that they enlist
<br/>the interests of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those
<br/>mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often made irksome in
<br/>other instruction books. The time has arrived when a superficial know-
<br/>ledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of
<br/>such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be enabled to Read music
<br/>with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
<br/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
<br/>lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from
<br/>professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s
<br/>Method overall others yet published in this country, most of them
<br/>having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to
<br/>give a few of the names in the principal cities.</p>
