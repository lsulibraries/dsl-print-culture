editor and proprietor.
NEW-YORK, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1845.
Sonnet.
ON SEEING THE IVORY STATUS OF CHRIST.
The enthusiast brooding in his cell apart
O’er the sad image of the Crucified,
The drooping head, closed lips and pierced side,
A holy vision fills his raptured heart;
With heavenly power inspired, his unskilled arm
Shapes the rude block to this transcendant form.
Oh Son of God! thus, ever thus, would I
Dwell on the loveliness enshrined in Thee,
The lofty faith, the sweet humility,
The boundless love, the love that could not die.
And as the sculptor with thy glory warm
Gives to this chiselled ivory thy fair form,
So would my spirit in thy Thought divine
Grow to a semblance, fair as this of Thine.
ANNE C. LYNCH.
A New Mode of Collecting a Library.
</p>
         <p>The Knickerbocker Magazine has received a severe re-
<br/>buke from the city press, during the last week, for some
<br/>peculiarities in its general conduct, and especially for the
<br/>spirit and letter of an article in the last number, upon
<br/>Mr. Mathews. The inquiry has arisen in many quarters,
<br/>what has Mr. Mathews done to subject himself to this
<br/>extraordinary annoyance and detraction? Of what lite-
<br/>rary or social offences has he been guilty, that he should
<br/>be pilloried in the small print and pelted with the pleas-
<br/>ant missives of the “ Editor's Table ?” Better dine with
<br/>Duke Humphrey than sit down to the scraps and cheese-
<br/>parings of such a table. “What is this?” says an old
<br/>gentleman, a merchant, a subscriber to the Knickerbocker
<br/>Magazine. “ John, get me a copy of Big Abel. I must
<br/>look into it; always my practice. There’s that fellow,
<br/>Pipkins, comes to my store, passes the best hour of the
<br/>day in abusing Jenkins, drones over cotton, sighs at real
<br/>estate, shudders at stocks. Memorandum: Make it a
<br/>rule, when he is gone out to give Jenkins unlimited cre-
<br/>dit, buy up cotton, hold on to real estate, and invest in
<br/>Wall Street. So much advice is never gratuitous ; goes
<br/>by contraries. Always make it a rule to buy the books
<br/>upon which the most malice is expended. Malice is too
<br/>valuable a quality to throw away upon mere emptiness.
<br/>Never knew it to fail. In consequence have got one of
<br/>the best libraries in town. Vastly indebted to the Knick-
<br/>erbocker in this respect. Remember reading once in the
<br/>small type, something to the effect that Coleridge was a
<br/>bore—stole all his ideas, and didn’t understand himself
<br/>after all. Became the purchaser of a copy of Coleridge’s
<br/>Works. Submitted to six months intellectual discipline,
<br/>and passed the wisest hours of my life. Very great dif-
<br/>ference between Coleridge and Clark. Impossible to
<br/>measure the ocean with a thimble. In the same way
<br/>saw John Neal called " crazy Neal.” Had never paid</p>
         <p/>
         <p>much attention to American Literature. Was induced
<br/>to look for his works. Found them out of print. Very
<br/>extraordinary circumstance, for a trashy author. Got a
<br/>copy of “ Seventy-Six” at last. Read it, holding my
<br/>breath all the while. Full of life, passion, and patriot-
<br/>ism, with an intense earnestness. Same thing with
<br/>Simms. The small type called him a “naughty man.”
<br/>Found him, on investigation, a frank, manly Southron;
<br/>carving his own way to fame, brushing off the musqui-
<br/>tos with a sturdy right arm as he went An extremely
<br/>“naughty man,” in the way of demolishing shabbiness;
<br/>but probably with some virtues of his own, or the Harpers
<br/>would not have published for him, or his chivalric coun-
<br/>trymen sent him to the Legislature :—added his forty vol-
<br/>umes to the shelf. A lecturer came here, by the name of
<br/>Hudson. Was tired and exhausted with lectures of all
<br/>sorts—had made up my mind never to attend another lec-
<br/>ture in my life. One day, the small type began to spirt
<br/>and spatter. The Angel was evidently troubling the wa-
<br/>ters. Took tickets for the course of lectures for wife and
<br/>family, and attended with them all through. That Hud-
<br/>son had a muzzle which closed upon a truth like a bull dog
<br/>upon a bone. What compressed force and sinewy intel-
<br/>lect ! A tremendous fellow at crushing a falsehood.—
<br/>The bones and cartilage of Error crunched in his “ bear’s
<br/>paw.” Trembled once for the “ small type.” “Ah ! John,
<br/>you have come. What kept you so long?” “Please,
<br/>sir, the first edition was exhausted, and had to scramble
<br/>about among the retailers for a copy.” “ Strange again;
<br/>very like 'crazy Neal.’ Can the public read the small
<br/>type? Doubtful. Read us a passage.” John reads the
<br/>vindication of a suspected criminal:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Another officer came in from a bye-way. That was a wicked
<br/>devil he had in charge—make up your mind that. A murderer?
<br/>Why, no. A wronger of orphans in their pale and tender youth?
<br/>Not that either. A cutter to the quick of honest fame? I can’t
<br/>say that. Suspected—that’s all. A wicked devil, you see. His
<br/>coat shows that, by its thin, shivering way of sitting about the
<br/>shoulders. His spindle limbs that just keep him up; his face
<br/>covered with no memory of a sufficient meal, even a long way off.
<br/>Suspected? Who better or more than he? Of all the men that
<br/>run or wa1k or ride within the city bounds, he is the guiltiest-sus-
<br/>pected wretch. Thrust him in a cell: the ground must be damp:
<br/>on bread and water ; where rats, if any are to be had thereabout,
<br/>may have free resort to him ; and in a few days—a very few days—
<br/>Suspicion, at a touch almost, will become a fearful certainty. He
<br/>will be dead! Lawgivers and magistrates—you know—he will
<br/>be dead !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Something honest and feelingly spoken in that.—
<br/>Take another dip.” Reads the Indian’s reflections during
<br/>the night of that day which was devoted to the “ City at
<br/>its Crimes.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And now to-bed ; up-stairs, with candles, one to lead and one to
<br/>follow, they wait on Lankey and Big Abel. Tidy chambers, and in
<br/>half a minute Big Abel sound asleep. But still the rain kept pat-
<br/>tering down, and stirred poor Lankey's Indian heart with strange
<br/>effect. In this humor, as he laid awake, he heard in a far-off street</p>
         <p>284	THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p>
         <p>the dolefully of some late-tarrying man,—“Oysters' —on a wet
<br/>drizzly summer’s night the melancholies! sound — delivered to him
<br/>as though it was sung in a far-off world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Then, as Lankey thought of turbulent rivers, swelled by this
<br/>heavy fall of rain, and the roar of the angry Bay stretching far out
<br/>to sea, there sprung upon the air, from down the dreary hollow they
<br/>had rambled through that day, a quick, sharp cry for life; a wo-
<br/>man’s voice; a fearful cry for dead midnight ! Lankey was
<br/>troubled. He could not sleep ; and going to the window, he bent
<br/>himself upon his hands, and looked abroad. While yet his eyes
<br/>glowed strangely upon the dark, there came gliding along a woman’s
<br/>shape, with hair streaming back with the light that was abroad
<br/>from lamps about, and eyes glistening-wet with sadness or joy too
<br/>great to keep its fountain in the heart. Ah, what a cry shot up just
<br/>then against the sky  She spread her hands. There was no one
<br/>near to see her, save Lankey, none besides, nor far away ; all the
<br/>wide city’s eyes were shut; and she possessed the night alone, with
<br/>sorrow, for another night, within her breast. For ever so! The
<br/>keenest hurts, the deadliest wrongs life lays on human souls, have
<br/>none, save God and  the poor heart, to know of them!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Following this dim figure through the perilous night along the
<br/>winding way, the Little Manhattan called to mind how once an
<br/>ancient path that led into the hills ran there before it, and how in
<br/>sadness deep as this the dusky maiden took her way, so long ago,
<br/>up towards the calm blue heaven, and sought to soothe her spirit
<br/>with the silence of the woods, the sight of stars, and whispering of
<br/>the winds of night.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>When he sought sleep again, he had a troubled dream in which,
<br/>by some strange magic in his thoughts, the city passed back out
<br/>of all its squares and streets and stony flats into his fresh, fair,
<br/>lovely island-youth ; of hill, stream, valley, wood. Ah, how he
<br/>pined to have them by the hand, kinsmen, as he saw them now,
<br/>silent in the lodge, or swift at chase, or shining from the ruddy
<br/>fight! But morning came, and took them all away</p>
         <p>Ah, sad and gentle. A true vein in that ! Once more
the scene changes to the Battery.
</p>
         <p>And how bore the old Battery this far-and-wide repose? Set-
<br/>tled in the midst of it like a smooth-backed duck in the water ! He
<br/>held his breath and listened for the Bay to speak, and the ships, and
<br/>the islands. The great trees ; not a whisper from them ! The
<br/>grass ; not the rustling of a blade! And up and down the paths
<br/>there moved stout old gentlemen, and thin young gentlemen with
<br/>canes under their arms, and masters, and ’prentices, and shop-
<br/>keepers and shop-boys, throngs of them ; and, the very Spirit of the
<br/>whole thing, there went along, close to the railing, as near the wa-
<br/>ter as he could, an old sea-dog of a grizzled captain, who snuffed
<br/>hes alt air and caught a flavor of the oakum and the tar that lin-
<br/>gers round about, and seemed to hush within himself the thousand
<br/>storms he knew of, off Bahamas and the Capes, and down the hot
<br/>Gulf Stream. There was a packet captain for you! Not a word
<br/>of the sea, nor of fine company on ship-board, nor wrecks, nor
<br/>great northwesterners, nor strange appearances far from the shore,
<br/>nor spouting whales, cutting voyages, men overboard. But all
<br/>about a little plot of ground, he mentioned, in Westchester : a few
<br/>acres only: the soil was good, the plough went always twenty inches
<br/>in the mould ; sufficient for a horse and cow. So much for land.
<br/>The house (this was his vision of a house) red-roofed, one-storied,
<br/>with a dainty balcony before (for smokers in long summer after-
<br/>noons) ; a grassy green ; some sea-thought there, no doubt! and
<br/>then, roving there, as easy and as kind and soft in glossy beauty
<br/>for the eye to dwell on as the summer’s day itself, a smooth, snug,
<br/>cobby horse. Not far off, a gig ; at rest now ; but out upon the
<br/>road once with that cobby horse, they'll play the mischief all the
<br/>country round ! And, as for drivers, where’s to match the grizzled
<br/>seaman with his cunning hand ! Climbing far away the winding
<br/>roads ; there arc such roads there ; they get, a truth to tell, a look
<br/>out to the sea. Ah, there it is again, old sea-dog; all the salt is in
<br/>you still, and keeps fresh that stormy heart, though beating in the
<br/>very bloom of silent fields !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Lay that book on the centre table where my friends
<br/>may see it, and now read that passage in the small type
<br/>of the Knickerbocker. John reads:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ A bald inventory of everything that strikes the eye of the writer,
<br/>(who you cannot help thinking, has ‘a screw loose’ somewhere in
<br/>his mental machinery). To us the book seems about as 'deep' as
<br/>a thimble. It requires no thought from those who road it, for the
<br/>simple reason that it made no such demand upon the author who
<br/>wrote it. We cannot help giving it as our settled conviction, after
<br/>a careful perusal, that 'Big Abel’ is a dreadful failure', that in
<br/>short 'to compare it with a bottle of small beer, would be greatly to
<br/>belie that fluid.’ ”</p>
         <p>“So Dogberry ‘could not help giving it as his settled
conviction-’ with due reiteration that he was an—!
</p>
         <p>John, you may go to-morrow and 'stop’ the Knickerbocker;
<br/>but stay, I’ll lose my guide to the authors of the country.
<br/>You may read me the critical passages first and take it
<br/>away afterwards.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Old Gentleman was a logical man in his way.
<br/>We have given up our space to his conversation though
<br/>we have much else to say, “ if not toothsome yet whole-
<br/>some,” according to an old writer, which we reserve for
<br/>our leisure and convenience.</p>
         <p>THE AMERICAN PIONEER.
How bravely moves the warrior, in panoply arrayed,
As marching on to battle, he draws his shining blade!
His enemies he scatters, like chaff before we wind,
And drives Despair Before him, while Ruin stalks behind,
And gains, perchance a province, to ruthless pillage given,
And from the wretched curses that will drive his soul from heaven!
But never rose a warrior among the sons of men—
Not Cœur de Leon when he marched against the Saracen,
</p>
         <p>More brave than Peace has nurtured, and Freedom’s host sent forth,
<br/>With neither sword nor trappings, to the conquest of the earth.
<br/>Behold the young American, how cheerily he moves,</p>
         <p>And proudly as a Paladin protecting those he loves—
His sinewy hands shall wrestle with Nature for her spoil,
The giant trees shall feel his axe, his plough subdue the soil,
</p>
         <p>And now he eyes his waggon, with its snow-white curtain veil’d,
<br/>And his steeds that like Bucephalus their master never fail’d,—
<br/>But pride is merged in gladness, and his heart is beating high,
<br/>When through the snowy curtains, like stars in June’s soft sky,</p>
         <p>The laughing eyes of childhood peer upon his way of toil.
And she, his gentle wife looks forth, to cheer him with her smile.
She smiles, that gentle woman, and yet a sigh will come,
When rises on her reverie the cherished scenes of home,
</p>
         <p>—The clear and calm Connecticut, the schoolhouse in the glade,
<br/>The Church upon the village green, the old elm’s chequered shade;
<br/>The seat beneath the hawthorn, when summer days were long,</p>
         <p>The seat beside the hearth-stone, when autumn winds were strong,
The friends—but here she pauses and forces back the tear—
Her husband is beside her, and, shall she grieve or fear
Her husband is beside her, their children at her knee,
They go with blessings dowered to gain the triumph of the Free;
A sovereignty unchallenged by earthly king or lord—
A home of peace and plenty, brave Labor's just reward:—
The Starry Banner o’er them, what foe will dare molest?
And in God’s forest Temple how sweet the Sabbath Rest!—
And so, in faith, in hope, and love, those pioneeers move on,
As though an Angel led the way toward the setting sun.
Sarah J. Hale.
Fancies
</p>
         <p>The Past—the Present—the Future. The shadowy
<br/>phantom that broodeth over the by-gone—the stern spi-
<br/>rit of the things that be—the dread spectre of the to-
<br/>come.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Lo! where roll the waters of Oblivion adown that
<br/>vale dimmed by the pail of sumless ages. Onward they
<br/>sweep ; on—forever on—and no pauses, nor back-turnings</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p285"/>
         </p>
         <p>be theirs. Terrible they sweep—for in their depths exist-
<br/>ence is annihilated. Noiseless they sweep; for, high upon
<br/>e livid wave, his stony finger planted on his compressed
<br/>p, triumphant floats grim Silence. And ever, as, out-
<br/>gushing from the unfathomable bosom of Eternity, they
<br/>have flowed forth on their awful way, stilled have been
<br/>the voices of submerged cities and states all glorious, and
<br/>only not omnipotent. Stilled have been the tones of ca-
<br/>vernous India, and proud Assyria, and sepulchral Egypt,
<br/>and hallowed Greece, and mighty Rome—aye, Rome,
<br/>within whose Coliseum even yet shall ye see, by the mid-
<br/>night watch, the ghost of the gladiator dim flitting across
<br/>the vacant area, or the mailed spirit of the stern centu-
<br/>rion lone stalking within that towering Palladium of his
<br/>world. A hundred—a thousand—all nations ! Gaze into
<br/>that tide, and ye shall see no sight. List by that black-
<br/>ened shore, and ye shall hear no sound. As well might
<br/>ye there linger for the sweetest dream-murmurs of the in-
<br/>fant as for the thunder-shouts of congregated myriads. Yes,
<br/>there be kings and their people—lords and their serfs—
<br/>heroes and cravens—patriots and recreants—glorious in-
<br/>telligences, that have lightened over a wondering world,
<br/>and those in whose breasts the foul emissaries of Hell
<br/>once revelled. There be joys, and sorrows, and hopes
<br/>whose stars have gone down, and memories whose wand
<br/>of power hath been dashed to pieces, and high ambition
<br/>quenched—materiality and immateriality—all lost, ever-
<br/>lastingly lost! And where, too, are so many of our own
<br/>old joys and griefs and hopes ? Often, oh ! often an inef-
<br/>fable ecstasy, wildly moving across the heart’s strings
<br/>like the gathering breath of the west across the chords
<br/>f the unfingered wind-harp, hath beaten its unmeasured
<br/>music in the throbbing pulse ; and often hath the soul
<br/>been shaded by the dark flapping wing of agony. But
<br/>they are gone—the glory of exultation and the gloom of
<br/>anguish ; transient as the Day-god’s effulgence, or as the
<br/>shattered cloud that dims it, when the storm-shroud is
<br/>fitfully passing from before the face of Heaven. They
<br/>have all gone down in that rolling tide. Awe for the
<br/>mighty Past!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Present—bridge from the Past to the Future, ever
<br/>frail, ever changing. Entity, nonenity. Link in the in-
<br/>finite chain ! At the dawn of creation, when Chaos was
<br/>transfused into forms of perfect beauty, and primeval
<br/>Night first rolled away before the fiat of the Almighty,
<br/>wide over the earth shone God’s high power and good-
<br/>ness, in characters of living splendor, and were sublimely
<br/>hymned through infinity of space, in the undying paeans
<br/>of the stars of Heaven ! And yet as wondrously are they
<br/>graven upon the front of Nature, yet as marvellously
<br/>pealed by those far-rolling orbs of fire. Still, in mystic
<br/>regularity, revolves the rapid year ; still comes the holy
<br/>sunshine still the storm ; still comes the glorious day-
<br/>spring, noun and eve, and night in her deep halls unrolls
<br/>her starry robe. And yet do the Fates unravel and weave
<br/>and cut the threads of human life. There be births,
<br/>there be deaths ; there be ripenings and strengthenings
<br/>and uprisings in proud integrity—and wastings and sink-
<br/>ings and a down-sending of earth to earth, and a rotting,
<br/>and crawling of the gorged grave-worm—and then, when
<br/>ye dig, ye find but cold, damp mould. And oh ! in the
<br/>march of time, how little changed is man ! We are ; and
<br/>around us, in countless breasts, are glowing the self-same
<br/>emotions that glowed in those of old. Joys are ela-
<br/>ting, sorrows subduing, hopes shedding their evanescent
<br/>smiles; ambition is pluming her insubstantial wings, re-
<br/>morse is corroding, revenge is at his fearful labors. And</p>
         <p/>
         <p>kingdoms are rising, and kingdoms are tottering, and
<br/>kingdoms are falling; and monarchs and slaves—the
<br/>great and the lowly—the good and the evil—the demi-
<br/>god and the moonling—were not, and are ; are, and shall
<br/>not be. And as of that strange and deep-sounding an-
<br/>them of life that goeth incessantly up, one strain riseth,
<br/>its usherer-in, slow floating back, dieth away forever and
<br/>forever. We are, and lor that we are, joy for the Pre-
<br/>sent !</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Future—twin sister of the Past—as dark, as dread,
<br/>and oh! how vacant ! Through its undiscovered ways
<br/>are yet to travel what multitudes of Earth’s own chil-
<br/>dren, what myriads of vet uncreated things! How is its
<br/>silence to be broken by the shrill cry of youth, the deep
<br/>tone of manhood, the bitter murmurings of age; the voice
<br/>of rejoicing, the moan of anguish; the hum of the
<br/>peaceful traffickers, the giant roar of contending nations,
<br/>the crash of falling monarchies! There shall intermin-
<br/>gle, and rise to that thunder-pavillioned throne of eter-
<br/>nity, the vaunt of the blood-reeking conqueror, and the
<br/>cracking of the strings of the poor human heart. There
<br/>shall go up the meek prayer of helplessness and inno-
<br/>cence, and the high blasphemy of the strong boaster. As
<br/>it hath been, so it shall be. Still shall scythed Saturn,
<br/>(oh solemn and truthful myth!) devour his progeny, the
<br/>bright and golden hours, who ever, as they die. shall be-
<br/>queath their awful burthen to their young sisters. Still,
<br/>over old earth—her womb one vast charnel house—shall
<br/>spread the gorgeous vale, shall rise the cloud-heaving
<br/>mount, shall stretch the sombre forest, shall heave the
<br/>tide of ocean, shall rush the swelling river, shall dance
<br/>the sparkling brooklet. And who may tell how long?
<br/>aye, who how long the earth shall roll, the sun shall
<br/>blaze, and yet how long shall peal those paeans of the
<br/>circling hosts? Mystery for the Future! Joy for the
<br/>Present ; and Awe for the mighty Past.</p>
         <p>R. S. Rowley.
The Autumnal Leaf
</p>
         <p>Thou faded leaf! it seems to be
<br/>But as of yesterday
<br/>When thou didst flourish on the tree
<br/>In all the pride of May.</p>
         <p>Then ’twas the merry hour of spring—
Of Nature’s fairest blossoming.
</p>
         <p>On field, on flower, on spray
<br/>It promised fair; how changed the scene
<br/>To what is now, from what hath been!</p>
         <p>So fares it with lire’s early Spring ;
Hope gilds each coming day,
And sweetly does the Syren sing
Her fond delusive la,
</p>
         <p>Then the young fervent heart beats high
<br/>Whilst passion kindles in the eye
<br/>With bright unceasing play
<br/>Fair are thy tints, thou genial Hour,</p>
         <p>Yet transient as the autumn flower.
Thou faded leaf! how like to thee
Is beauty in her morning pride,
When life is but a summer sea
And hope illumes its placid tide:
Alas! for beauty’s autumn hour,
Alas! for beauty’s blighted flower!
When hope and bliss have died,
Her pallid brow, her cheek of grief
Have thy sad hue, thou faded leaf
<a href="#p286"/>
Autumnal leaf! there is a stern
And warning tone in thy decay:
Like thee must man to death return
With his trail tenement of clay.
Thy warning is of death and doom
Of genius blighted in its bloom,
Of joy’s o’erclouded ray;
Life, rapture, hope,|ye are as brief
And fleeting as the Autumn leaf.
O. H. Mildeberger.
Critical Notices.
The Artist, the Merchant, and the Statesman. By C.
Edwards Lester. Vol. 1. New-York: Paine &amp; Bur-
gess, 62 John-street.
</p>
         <p>This book opens with a commentary on the chief por-
<br/>tion of its contents, in a likeness of Mr. Powers. The
<br/>Sculptor, whose name has recently grown into a world-
<br/>wide one, by the success of his Greek Slave, has a square,
<br/>firm head, un-ideal in its outline, but indicating quick ob-
<br/>servation, and great depth of purpose ; deficient in pro-
<br/>portion and geniality in the lower features, with a broad
<br/>brow, and an eye rather steady than kindling in its glance.
<br/>The countenance is a criticism on the autobiography of
<br/>Mr. Powers, of which the book mainly consists. His
<br/>discourse in these conversations with Mr. Lester, in
<br/>which the autobiography is disclosed, is plain, sensible,
<br/>in a judicious spirit of praise and censure, showing the
<br/>practised and the practical eye, at times glancing off,
<br/>Yankee-like, sharply to the main chance; independent,
<br/>as is, or should be characteristic of an American, of old
<br/>usage and authority, and leaving altogether on the read-
<br/>er’s mind an opinion honorable to the sense and intellect
<br/>of the artist.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The language of the Conversations is generally clear
<br/>and simple, and such as a sculptor, used to a clear,
<br/>round outline, might be expected to employ. Throughout
<br/>there are dropped, from time to time, hints and sugges-
<br/>tions likely to be of decided service to art, and to art, par-
<br/>ticularly, in the United States. The zeal of Mr. Powers
<br/>for the embellishment of the country by fountain-pieces,
<br/>statues and monuments, agrees with our own long-enter-
<br/>tained sentiments entirely ; and in his utter repudiation
<br/>of the mongrel in monumental architecture, like the pro-
<br/>posed Washington Memorial, with its subsidiary library,
<br/>reading-room, &amp;c., we heartily concur. The most sus-
<br/>tained speculation in the Conversations, is that upon a
<br/>proper monument of Washington; and, although we
<br/>doubt whether at all points the ground is properly laid
<br/>out by the artist, we give it at length :</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A very laudable effort is now making, not by the Government,
<br/>which ought to have done it long ago, but by some generous indi-
<br/>viduals in America, to erect a monument to Washington; and I
<br/>hope it will be a monument. But a Public Edifice they propose to
<br/>call a monument, which would have answered their purpose just
<br/>as well, might have been had without the trouble and expense of
<br/>building one. I should be sorry to see so great a name as Wash-
<br/>ington’s associated in a monument with Institutions, Libraries,
<br/>Rooms for Art, Debating Societies, &amp;c.; all dignified by the name
<br/>of a monument to our great Hero and Father. Almost as soon
<br/>would I think of changing money in a church, or profaning the
<br/>altars of God with traffic, as to convert Washington’s monument
<br/>into such a business-like place.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Monuments to the dead should never be made the habitations of
<br/>the living; they should be resorted to, to teach us how to live and
<br/>how to die, and an eternal Sabbath should be kept around their
<br/>graves. Let some imposing but solemn structure be raised over
<br/>the dust of Washington—single in its purpose and single in its</p>
         <p/>
         <p>form. Let it be made of the most durable and massive materials;
<br/>and let it rise as high as a grateful nation can carry it—without
<br/>spires, or turrets, or windows, or any other littleness to disturb the
<br/>grandeur and solemnity of its design. Let it, in a word be in har-
<br/>mony with the character of the man.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The most appropriate monument is that which, as far as the na-
<br/>ture of such a thing can do, illustrates this character. It should
<br/>be something analogous. If a man of taste and literary pursuits,
<br/>his tomb should be embellished with ornaments, and all its pro-
<br/>portions should present a classic appearance; if a military hero,
<br/>his monument should be in keeping with the spirit of loftiness, and
<br/>breathe the soul of daring and glory, so that his character might
<br/>be clearly known without reading the inscription. And such is
<br/>the richness and fertility of the genius of the fine arts, as under-
<br/>stood by great artists, their language is even more expressive in
<br/>the hands of the master, than any other language in the world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But a monument to such a man as Washington, who is not con-
<br/>sidered as a scholar, nor even so much as a military hero, or
<br/>statesman, as one of those exalted characters that stand far above
<br/>all other men, embracing all that is noble known to humanity, and
<br/>even something we may almost regard as divine; one who never
<br/>lived before, nor is likely ever to live again;—his monument
<br/>should be as distinct from all others, as he was from all other men.
<br/>A classic monument would not do for him, nor a military monu-
<br/>ment, nor any other peculiar style; for none of them can reach
<br/>him. No little thing should be introduced in it; no petty parts or
<br/>decorations; it should be distinct and unbroken, and rise in solemn
<br/>grandeur, a simple mass of vast bulk and height, so that it might
<br/>be seen across a plain fifty miles off, surmounted by his statue of
<br/>such colossal proportions, it might be recognized, if possible, even
<br/>at that distance as the statue of Washington. And this would not
<br/>be so difficult as might appear; for such were his form and gen-
<br/>eral proportions, so different from all other men, and so expressive
<br/>of himself, that the most feeble attempt at his likeness never fails
<br/>to be recognized. His person was as distinct from other men as
<br/>was his character.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But of what form should be this monument, to express the dura-
<br/>bility of his fame, and at the same lime embody and illustrate that
<br/>solemnity of character so peculiarly his own? Before answering
<br/>this question, we should look for guidance, and enquire what hu-
<br/>man structures have stood the longest, and will probably descend
<br/>farthest into coming ages. And at the same time what are the
<br/>most expressive, and excite the greatest wonder over successive
<br/>races of men.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Are they solemn temples or sumptuous palaces, or lofty towers,
<br/>or massive obelisks, or solid columns, or colossal statutes? The
<br/>learned have spent ages in disputing about the site of Babylon,
<br/>with her gorgeous temples, and Thebes, with her hundred brazen
<br/>gates. The ruins even of Roman structures, reared less than two
<br/>thousand years ago, have long been preserved with sacred venera-
<br/>tion ; and the temples of Greece are mournful heaps. But the
<br/>Pyramids of Egypt still lift their awful forms over the desert, and
<br/>have watched the rise and the fall of a long succession of Empires.
<br/>Human knowledge gropes back through dim ages to find the era
<br/>of their beginning, and still time strives in vain to overwhelm
<br/>them. The obelisks lie scattered around the deserts, or have been
<br/>carried away by distant travellers; and the Memnon lies prostrate
<br/>in the dust.. The great cities that once Mood upon the banks of
<br/>the Nile, are levelled with the ocean of sand around them; and
<br/>almost every vestige of the work of man has passed away in the
<br/>flowing tide of ages. But the Pyramids still stand, and still rear
<br/>themselves as vast as ever; stupendous beacons to the traveller
<br/>from distant countries; piercing the clouds, where they catch the
<br/>first blush of morning that flames on their summits, as fair as in
<br/>the morning of Creation; defying the barbarous hand of the spoiler
<br/>and the sweeping desolation of ages.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Why were they made? This question we may answer with
<br/>certainty—they were raised for monuments. They contained the
<br/>ashes of the dead, and a platform was left on their tops, we have
<br/>good reason to infer, to receive colossal statues or figures in illus-
<br/>tration of the dead beneath them. This would seem to be certain,
<br/>for the science which built them never would have left them in-
<br/>complete without an object.</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p287"/>
         </p>
         <p>And where is there anything in the universe human like them
<br/>but the character of Washington, and what monument could we
<br/>raise so appropriate to the Father of his Country?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Washington’s fame we well know can never die—it would out-
<br/>live the Pyramids, without a monument and without a line or
<br/>eulogy. But a long line of generations is to follow us ; and when
<br/>they come upon the stage for their brief hour in the sweep of ages,
<br/>each one to ask that distant Republic whose history will then have
<br/>grown dim, what monument of gratitude she left to her Glorious
<br/>Deliverer, let them turn to some pyramidal structure surmounted
<br/>by a vast statue of Washington, of everlasting bronze:</p>
         <p>" Like some tall cliff that lids its awful form,
Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm :
Though round its base the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.”
</p>
         <p>As connected with another eminent American, of an-
<br/>other day and an entirely different cast of character, the
<br/>artist’s interview with General Jackson is worthy of par-
<br/>ticular mention.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The general arrangement and spirit of the book are ex-
<br/>tremely creditable to Mr. Lester, although there are cer-
<br/>tain defects and blemishes which we regret to find mar-
<br/>ring the volume. One of these is the inharmonious and
<br/>inartistical union, in the same volume, of two subjects
<br/>with so little to connect them, (although they are brought
<br/>together in the general title of the work,) as an autobi-
<br/>ography of Hiram Powers, the Sculptor, and a Treatise
<br/>on the Consular System. Of this the editor is acquitted
<br/>by the modest requirement of the Sculptor, that he should
<br/>not be left to stand alone, in his autobiogaphical disclo-
<br/>sures, in a book by himself. To the style of the work,
<br/>in Mr. Lester’s portion of it, we might take some ex-
<br/>ception, in an extreme colloquialism which, although
<br/>not offensive in the eagerness of a first reading, will
<br/>injure it as a permanent record. There are great spirit
<br/>and naturalness in Mr. Lester’s use of this style ; and we
<br/>prefer it infinitely to the stilted assumption of a scholastic
<br/>manner. We would have been glad to have found some-
<br/>where in the volume, or in Mr. Powers’ discourse, a re-
<br/>cognition of his young contemporary, Crawford, who,
<br/>though of an entirely different school and faith from Pow-
<br/>ers, has labored too long and too truly, to be out of mind
<br/>when the talk is of American Sculptors, who have hon-
<br/>ored their country in their labors. It is possible that Mr.
<br/>Lester intends to supply this, and other omissions, in his
<br/>second volume, which is to include, we are told, sketches
<br/>of various American artists. On the whole, we are
<br/>pleased with this work, in the part we have given our
<br/>attention to, (of the other portion of it we may speak
<br/>at length hereafter) and believe it will be of service in
<br/>its province.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Powers we have been in the habit of regarding
<br/>as one of the few representative Americans, ranking in
<br/>art with Webster, Jackson, Forrest, and other strong-
<br/>minded and sturdy-working men in other departments.
<br/>He has in him the true indigenous sinew and straight-
<br/>forwardness of the place—the freedom from petty liga-
<br/>tures of schools, and fashions, and tastes, with which
<br/>old-world people are apt to be oppressed. He has had a
<br/>long and hard fight with fortune, such as every original
<br/>and un-conventional man may lay his account in sus-
<br/>taining ; and he has come out of it, as every such man
<br/>will, with a bright renown and an honor untouched
<br/>through all its trials. We, for one, do not regret the
<br/>learning of short-hand by Mr. Lester, as that seems to
<br/>have enabled him to give us these excellent and judicious
<br/>Conversations, and we shall look for his concluding vol-
<br/>ume of the Artist, Merchant and Statesman, with a good
<br/>hope of profitable entertainment.</p>
         <p>In paper, typography, and general appearance, the vol-
ume is neatly presented by the spirited publishers.
Specimens of English Dramatic Poets, who lived about
the time of Shakspeare. With Notes: By Charles
Lamb. In two Volumes. Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library
of Choice Reading, Nos. XXIX—XXX.
</p>
         <p>If the Cheap Era in Literature had began with the first
<br/>settlement of America, the improved Power Press been
<br/>set in motion, throwing off its thousand sheets per hour,
<br/>and steamboats and railroads been ready to blaze its issues
<br/>through the country,—and it had happened that these
<br/>Specimens had been the first work to engage their services,
<br/>the whole face of its Literature would, according to all
<br/>ordinary modes of calculation, have been changed, and
<br/>would now present the aspect of a Jupiter rather than
<br/>an Adonis. As it is, we set out in our career at the period
<br/>of the predominance of the French school, and the school of
<br/>Pope ; and it is only within a very recent period, that we
<br/>have given any indications of a desire to escape from it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have tinkled in the minor key, jingling our ten
<br/>feet and keeping close to our regular measures, with the
<br/>painful pertinacity of the droning minstrel of the streets.
<br/>So deeply has the infection struck that, although England
<br/>(our model and guide in these matters heretofore) has more
<br/>than once in that time been swept by manlier lyres and
<br/>braver singers, we have gone on in the old tune, assuaging
<br/>and mollifying, even in our copies of these better spirits,
<br/>strength and manhood and manly earnestness down to a
<br/>poor, piping treble. The restoration and triumph of the
<br/>Old Masters of English verse, in their own country, has
<br/>been no triumph nor restoration to us. We have gone on
<br/>in the old way in spite of new editions of Ben Jonson,
<br/>and Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Decker, Massinger,
<br/>and all the others of that hardy brood. Once in a long
<br/>while a voice has been raised in a comer, in behalf of this
<br/>noble peerage of elder poets—but without any obvious
<br/>change in the popular sentiment. Now however the
<br/>change has fairly come ! The country after undergoing the
<br/>weariness of droning poetasters for half a century and
<br/>more, has at length discovered that there is a kind of
<br/>Literature more in harmony with its circumstances, and
<br/>much truer to the breadth and grandeur of its national
<br/>developements. The publication of these Specimens, is
<br/>but the effervessence, of a spirit, long, quietly and patiently
<br/>at work, under the surface. And their reception will be
<br/>full of good omens to the future literary history of the
<br/>country.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have conveyed our general opinion of this work
<br/>in what we have already said: a word or two as to
<br/>its peculiar merits. No where in the whole compass of
<br/>its Literature, are the resources of the English tongue in
<br/>power, in sweetness, terror, pathos, in description and dia-
<br/>logue, so well displayed. These two volumes are by the</p>
         <p>best hearts of England of their day and generation.—
</p>
         <p>They speak the sorrow and the belief, the joy and the
<br/>agitation of their times, like men. They dip their pens
<br/>in the very life-blood of humanity, and write so as to stir
<br/>the life-blood. Their fear is real fear, their joy is real
<br/>joy, their grief, grief indeed, and no make believe. They
<br/>therefore speak to all men of all times. These genuine
<br/>words of theirs cutting their way through all of war,
<br/>and darkness and discordant history that stands between,
<br/>reach the present day, and with a vital fire come home to
<br/>our hearts, as they did to the hearts of their contemporaries.
<br/>See with what fire, and eagerness and inspired annimation
<br/>they address themselves to the loves and griefs and
<br/>passions of men and women !</p>

The forest deer being struck,
Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds;
But when the imperial lion’s flesh is gor’d,
He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw,
And highly scorning that the lowly earth
Should drink his blood, mounts up to th’ air.
Sometimes like Women or unwedded Maids,
Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love
Now comes my Lover tripping like the Roe,
And brings my longings tangled in her hair.
To joy her love I’ll build a kingly bower,
Seated in hearing of a hundred streams.
</p>
         <p>Then, as in Arden I have seen an oak
<br/>Long shook With tempests, and his lolly top
<br/>Bent to his root, which being at length made loose
<br/>(Even groaning with his weight) he ’gan to nod
<br/>This way and that, as loth his curled brows
<br/>(Which he had oft wrapt in the sky with storm)</p>
         <p>Should stoop; and yet, his radical fibres burst,
Storm-like he fell, and hid the fear-cold earth;
</p>
         <p>So fell stout Barrisor, that had stood the shocks
<br/>Of ten set battles in your highness’ war
<br/>Gainst the sole soldier of the world Navarre.</p>
         <p>Ferd. Is she dead?
Bos. She is what you would have her.
Fix your eye here.
Ferd Constantly.
Bos. Do you not weep?
Other sins only speak; murder shrieks out.
The element of water moistens the earth,
But blood flies upward and bedews the heavens.
Ferd. Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died so young.
Bos. I think not so: her infelicity
Seem’d to have years too many.
Ferd. She and I were twins;
And should I die this instant, I had lived
Her time to a minute.
</p>
         <p>The whole brood of modern bards bend before them,
<br/>like the slender woodland before the majestic breath of
<br/>God. To Charles Lamb, who by wise and delicious pains-
<br/>taking makes us masters and friends of these noble spir-
<br/>its, thanks indeed. What he says, descriptively, of his
<br/>plan in introducing them is well put.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The kind of extracts which I have sought after have been, not so
<br/>much passages of wit, though the old plays are rich in such,
<br/>as scenes of passion, sometimes of the deepest quality, interesting
<br/>situations, serious descriptions, that which is more nearly allied to
<br/>poetry than to wit, and to tragic rather than comic poetry</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And what be says, here and throughout these choice
<br/>volnmes in explanation or praise of his authors, is in ad-
<br/>mirable harmony with their own noble verse. One or
<br/>two of these masterly notes will satisfy the reader into
<br/>whose hands he entrusts himself.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*To move a horror skilfully, to touch a soul to the quick, to lay
<br/>upon fear as much as it can bear, to wean and weary a life till it is
<br/>ready to drop, and then step in with mortal instruments to take its
<br/>last forfeit: this only a Webster can do. Writers of an interior
<br/>genius may “upon horror's head horrors accumulate," but they
<br/>cannot do this. They mistake quantity for quality; they "terrify
<br/>babes with painted devils,” but they know not how a soul is capa-
<br/>ble of being moved; their terrors want dignity, their affrightments
<br/>are without decorum.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This tragedy, Marlowe’s Edward II , is in a very different style
<br/>from “ mighty Tamburlaine.” The reluctant pangs of abdicating
<br/>Royalty in Edward furnished hints which Shakespeare scarce im-
<br/>proved in his Richard the Second; and the death-scene of Mar-</p>
         <p>lowe’s king moves pity and terror beyond any scene, ancient, or
modern, with which I am acquainted.
</p>
         <p>Marlowe is said to have been tainted with atheistical positions,
<br/>to have denied God and the Trinity. To such a genius the history
<br/>of Faustus mast have been delectable food: to wander in fields
<br/>where curiosity is forbidden to go, to approach the dark gulf near
<br/>enough to look in, to be busied in speculations which are the rotten-
<br/>est part of the core of the fruit that fell from the tree of knowledge.
<br/>Barabas the Jew, and Faustus the conjuror, are offsprings of a
<br/>mind which at least delighted to dally with interdicted subjects.
<br/>They both talk a language which a believer would have been ten-
<br/>der of putting into the month of a character though but in fiction.
<br/>But the holiest minds have sometimes not thought it blameable to
<br/>counterfeit impiety in the person of another, to bring Vice in upon
<br/>the stage speaking her own dialect, and, themselves being armed
<br/>with an Unction of self-confident impunity, have not scrupled to
<br/>handle and touch that familiarly which would be death to others.
<br/>Milton, in the presence of Satan, has started speculations hardier
<br/>than any which the feeble armory of the atheist ever furnished:
<br/>anil the precise, strait-laced Richardson has strengthened Vice,
<br/>from the mouth of Lovelace, with entangling sophistries and ab-
<br/>struse pleas against her adversary Virtue; which Sedley, Villiers,
<br/>and Rochester wanted depth of libertinism sufficient to have in-
<br/>vented.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This scene in the Merry Devil of Edmonton has much of Shaks-
<br/>peare's manner in the sweetness and goodnaturedness of it. It
<br/>seems written to make the reader happy. Few of our dramatists
<br/>or novelists have attended enough to this. They torture and
<br/>wound us abundantly. They are economists only in delight.
<br/>Nothing can be finer, more gentlemanlike, and noble, than the con-
<br/>versation and compliments of these young men. How delicious is
<br/>Raymond Mounchensey's forgetting, in his tears, that Jerningham
<br/>has a “ Saint in Essex;” and how sweetly his friend reminds him!
<br/>—I wish it could be ascertained that Michael Drayton was the au-
<br/>thor of this piece; it would add a worthy appendage to the renowm
<br/>of that Panegyrist of my native Earth; who has gone over tier soil
<br/>(in his Polyolbion) with the fidelity of a herald, and the painful
<br/>love ot a son; who has not left a rivulet (so narrow that it may be
<br/>slept over) without honorable mention; and has animated Hills
<br/>and Streams with life and passion above the dreams of old my-
<br/>thology.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After all, Love’s Sectaries are a “ reason unto themselves.” We
<br/>have gone retrograde in the noble Heresy since the days when Sid-
<br/>ney proselyted our nation to this mixed health and disease; the
<br/>kindliest symptom yet the most alarming crisis in the ticklish state
<br/>of youth; the nourisher and the destroyed of hopeful wits; the
<br/>mother of twin-birds, wisdom and folly, valor and weakness; the
<br/>servitude above freedom; the gentle mind's religion; the liberal
<br/>superstition.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>No one will doubt, who reads Marston’s Satires, that the author
<br/>in some part of liis life must have been something mote than a the-
<br/>orist in vice. Have we never heard an old preacher in the pulpit
<br/>display such ati insight into the mystery of ungodliness, as
<br/>made us wonder with reason how a good man came by it?
<br/>When Cervantes with such proficiency of loudness dwells upon the
<br/>Don’s library, who sees not that he has been a great leader of books
<br/>of Knight-Errantry? perhaps was at some lime of his life in dan-
<br/>ger of tailing into those very extravagances which he ridicules so
<br/>happily in his Hero?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The blank uniformity to which all professional distinctions in ap-
<br/>parel have been long hastening, is one instance of the Decay of
<br/>Symbols among us, which, whether it has contributed or not to make
<br/>us a more intellectual, has certainly made us a less imaginative
<br/>people. Shakapeare knew the force of signs;—“a malignant and
<br/>turban'd Turk.” “This meal-cap Miller," says the Author of
<br/>God's Revenge against Murder, to express his indignation at an at-
<br/>trocious outrage committed by the miller Pierot upon the person of
<br/>the fair Marieta.</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p289"/>
         </p>
         <p>The insipid levelling morality to which the modern stage is tied
<br/>down would not admit of such terrible passions as these scenes
<br/>are tilled with. A puritanical obtuseness of sentiment, a stupid in-
<br/>fantile goodness, is creeping among us, instead of the vigorous pas-
<br/>sions, and virtues clad in flesh and blood, with which the old dra-
<br/>matists present us. These noble and liberal casuists could discern
<br/>in the differences, the quarrels, the animosities of man, a beauty
<br/>and truth of moral feeling, no less than in the iterately inculca-
<br/>ted duties of forgiveness and atonement. With us all is hypocriti-
<br/>cal meekness. A reconciliation scene (let the occasion be never so
<br/>absurd or unnatural) is always sure of applause. Our audiences
<br/>come to the theatre to be complimented on their goodness. They
<br/>compare notes with the amiable characters in the play, and find a
<br/>wonderful similarity of disposition between them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Of all the English Play-writers, Chapman perhaps approaches
<br/>nearest to Shakspeare in the descriptive and didactic, in passages
<br/>which are less purely dramatic. Dramatic imitation was not his
<br/>talent. He could not go out of himself, as Shakspeare could shift
<br/>at pleasure, to inform and animate other existences, but in himself
<br/>he had an eye to perceive and a soul to embrace all other forms.
<br/>He would have made a great epic poet, if, indeed, he has not abun-
<br/>dantly shown himself to be one; for his Homer is not so properly
<br/>a Translation as the Stories of Achilles and Ulysses re-written.
<br/>The earnestness and passion which he has put into every part of
<br/>these poems would be incredible to a reader of mere modern trans-
<br/>lations. His almost Greek zeal for the honor of his heroes is only
<br/>paralleled by that fierce spirit of Hebrew bigotry, with which Mil-
<br/>ton, as if personating one of the Zealots of the old law, clothed him-
<br/>self when he sat down to paint the acts of Sampson against the un-
<br/>circumcised.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We repine, we confess, at the taking down of this book
<br/>from our shelf, (it has been the dear companion of many
<br/>joyful years,) and leading it out into the market place.
<br/>But as we hope for many sharers, through it, in our old
<br/>and long-time enthusiasm for the Elders—we submit that
<br/>our fell-grief be made common, and that all mankind be
<br/>let in to ‘joy in our joy, and sadden in our sadness.’
<br/>Farewell, old Friends!—The million spread their hands to take you.</p>

<br/>Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini. Written by Himself.
<br/>Translated by Thomas Roscoe, Esq..</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We made but scant mention last week of this interest-
<br/>ing work ; but we may supply the omission of words of
<br/>our own by the following well written remarks from the
<br/>Evening Post:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A better book than the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini
<br/>could hardly have been chosen for the first number of the Foreign
<br/>Library. The old adage “ ce n’ est que le premier pas qui coute!"  must
<br/>have been in the minds of the publishers in the selection. It is a very
<br/>happy one, and if it is to be taken as an indication of the works
<br/>which are to follow, augurs well for their success.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In the original, this book is a classic. Its reputation among
<br/>Italian critics is very great, and by scholars, all the world over, it
<br/>has always been regarded as giving Cellini high rank as an au-
<br/>thor. To American readers it is comparatively unknown. The
<br/>present translation has never before been published in this coun-
<br/>try ; it is extremely felicitous and spirited; one forgets entirely
<br/>that he is not leading the author's own words in his own tongue,
<br/>so admirably are the difficulties of translation overcome. The
<br/>notes and observations of the Italian editor are included in this
<br/>edition, and form an instructive and interesting addition to the
<br/>text.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Benvenuto Cellini was born at Florence, in the year 1500.—
<br/>There and at Rome he spent the greater part of his life. He died
<br/>in 1570. His eminence as an artist, or rather, artisan in gold, sil-
<br/>ver and precious stones, and his exploits in the service of the
<br/>state, and in the course of his personal adventures, made him
<br/>famous in Italy and throughout Europe. The shop in which he
<br/>worked is pointed out on one of the bridges at Florence, and spe-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>cimens of his handicraft are carefully preserved as heir-looms in
<br/>ancient families, and exhibited as curiosities of note in the cabi-
<br/>nets of virtuosi, and in royal museums.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>At the age of fifty-eight he wrote his autobiography. Thus the
<br/>narrative embraces the first half of the sixteenth century, a brilliant
<br/>and eventful era. During the time, the fine arts reached the cul-
<br/>minating point in Italy, under the patronage of the Medici, in the
<br/>works of Michael Angelo, Raffael, and Titian.—These great mas-
<br/>ters, and others of almost equal eminence, were contemporaries
<br/>and intimates of Cellini, and figure in his pages. Besides these,
<br/>the circle of his acquaintance and friendship included many of the
<br/>first men of his times; he was the favorite and confidant of two
<br/>popes, of a king, and of cardinals and dukes royal without num-
<br/>ber. The pictures he gives of the habits and manners, the ways of
<br/>thinking, speaking and acting of the men with whom he came in
<br/>contact, especially the more illustrious, are vivid and life-like, and
<br/>doubtless more correct from the fact of their being incidental and
<br/>unstudied, and no part of the author’s main design.—The great ob-
<br/>ject of Cellini's book is his own glorification. He is his own hero.
<br/>He reaches the very acme of egotism. Not even his “Holiness”
<br/>himself can stand on the same level—it is "ego et pontifex meus”
<br/>throughout, and the same disrespect of persons marks his inter-
<br/>course with the whole tribe of dignitaries. Never was genius more
<br/>conscious of itself and its divine prerogatives; never was a man
<br/>predestined to immortality with a fuller acquiescence on his own
<br/>part. This spirit pervades the book, and is hall the secret of its
<br/>excellence. It is an egotism that forces our admiration. One can-
<br/>not help sympathising with the complete self-satisfaction of the au-
<br/>thor. A man so perfectly at ease with himself is invulnerable to
<br/>censure, he disarms prejudice and forestals criticism by asserting
<br/>the infallibility of his own judgment. He is always in the right—
<br/>his opinion invariably correct; his taste never at fault; his quarrel
<br/>never unjust. He maintains himself in all sons of controversies
<br/>with a firmness which would pass current anywhere for obstinacy ;
<br/>suffers daily contradiction from “fools,” “simpletons" and “ block-
<br/>heads,” unmoved; receives as matters of course the flatteries of
<br/>princes; and executes summary vengeance on his foes, as though
<br/>he were the appointed arbiter of fate. All this, while it would be
<br/>disgusting in most autobiographies, gives to this one of its highest
<br/>charms. It is impossible to find fault with Cellini for his egotism;
<br/>one might as well quarrel with Swift for his humor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>So with regard to his exaggerations. Some of his stories are
<br/>exceedingly marvellous, and far more creditable to his imagination
<br/>than his veracity. As an artist he was famous for giving rare
<br/>tints to diamonds and other precious stones—his facility as an au-
<br/>thor in imparting a happy gloss of the fanciful to a rough narra-
<br/>tive of facts is no less admirable. The Preface attributes most of
<br/>his exaggeration to his “ confined education, his susceptible nerves,
<br/>his superlative credulity and superstition, and his wild imagina-
<br/>tion.” To this fair apology it may be added, that a “strict adhe-
<br/>rence to truth,'' and a rigid “ abstinence from fiction,” was by no
<br/>means the characteristic of the writers of his time, especially where
<br/>their own exploits formed the subject matter of their narrations.—
<br/>Cellini’s book is a running commentary on the era in which he
<br/>lived—it reflects with wonderful accuracy and minuteness the very
<br/>form and spirit of the age; but it partakes of it itself. The incre-
<br/>dibility of his stories, his sublime indifference to dates and circum-
<br/>stances, his neglect of historic order or precision, while they unfit
<br/>the book to be what it does not pretend to be, a work of historical
<br/>accuracy, make it more faithful to the lime in which it was writ-
<br/>ten. We are almost driven to make as anomalous an assertion as
<br/>this, that if the book had been more reliable it would have been
<br/>less authentic.</p>

Song.
I.
Farewell! 'Twere vain to bid thee wear
Mine image in thy breast,—
Thou at another shrine wilt breathe
The vows that made me blest.
Yet I know when thou art lonely,
When a cloud lies on thy heart,
O'er thy memory, like a sunbeam,
Some thought of me will dart.
II.
And when low words of melody
Shall chain thy raptured ear —
When beauty’s cheek beneath thy glance
Its quick, pure blush shall wear —
Though I languish all forsaken,
Yet I know those tones, in thee,
And that kindling brow will waken
Some memory of me.
III.
And when soft fingers clasp thy hand,
When fond arms thee entwine;
When thou seest thyself reflected
In brighter eyes than mine,
Oh, then from out the Past my face,
Though prized no more it be,
Will beam upon thy memory,
As once it beamed on thee. Mary E. Hewitt.
The Drama.
</p>
         <p>By a certain fluttering in the Press, we can discern as
<br/>clearly as by the spreading of its wings, that the bird
<br/>would take under them the warmth of the rising sun, that
<br/>a new spirit is abroad in the Drama. The advent of this
<br/>better feeling we predicted long since. Among its earli-
<br/>est indications was the reception of the new comedy
<br/> Fashion’ (to which we cannot altogether give our criti-
<br/>cal approval, but which, as from the hand of a well-liked
<br/>woman, was a fortunate pioneer,) and of its authoress as
<br/>a performer on the same boards where her play had been
<br/>successfully produced. To these, are to be added, the
<br/>interest excited in Mr. Hudson’s admirable Lectures, ap-
<br/>pealing to the higher standards ; the general attention
<br/>called to the peculiar reception of Mr. Forrest, and Miss
<br/>Cushman, an American actor and actress in England.
<br/>Accumulating in the same direction we have another
<br/>comedy, from the pen of Mr. Epes Sargent, the offer of a
<br/>handsome (but inadequate) sum for a new play of Amer-
<br/>ican Life and Manners, by Mr. Manager Burton; a small
<br/>offer for a shorter piece of a similar complexion, by Mar-
<br/>ble, the Comedian—and, to crown all, the appearance of
<br/>an American actor upon the stage, in the person of
<br/>Mr. Murdoch, who at a bound has passed his English rivals
<br/>who were making a handsome figure in the country, or are
<br/>on their way to do so, and satisfied the American Public
<br/>once for all, that if they will be at the pains to look at
<br/>home when they arc in want of actors, they may possibly
<br/>find them. That a great change has come over the Amer-
<br/>ican Dramatic world within a very recent period—would
<br/>be manifest at once, if we should ask what chance of
<br/>success Mr. Murdoch might have entertained as an Amer-
<br/>ican Actor, if he had presented himself a couple of years
<br/>ago! We believe that the universal answer would be
<br/>that in spite of his great acknowledged talents, he must
<br/>have come near failing altogether, or at least that he would
<br/>have sorely felt the want of that popular and journalistic
<br/>support which has, lately, been so liberally accorded to
<br/>him. As we were among the first to stake our faith on
<br/>this young American performer, we feel bound to accom-
<br/>pany him in the future stages of his success. In Phila-
<br/>delphia where he played the week ending on the 8th No-
<br/>vember, he has had a great reception ; his first house at
<br/>the Walnut St. Theatre, being according to the corres-
<br/>pondent of the N. Y. Spirit of the Times, the largest au-
<br/>dience ever within its walls. The press and the people
<br/>have appeared with greater unanimity and enthusiasm,
<br/>if possible, in his behalf than even in New York. We
<br/>give the account of two or three of the most judicious and
<br/>sagacious of our Philadelphia contemporaries.</p>
         <p>From Neal's Saturday Gazette.
</p>
         <p>Quite a sensation has been created during the week, at the Wal-
<br/>nut street Theatre, by the return to the stage of our townsman and
<br/>long-established favorite, Mr. Murdoch, who after years of retire-
<br/>ment and careful study, once more presents himself as a candidate,
<br/>not, as heretofore, for a second place, but for a station in the front
<br/>rank of theatrical merit; and it was a source of much pleasure to
<br/>observe how cheerily the call to such an ordeal, on the part of an
<br/>American actor, was responded to by the public, who, knowing
<br/>that no crude attempt was to be offered to their consideration, and
<br/>that all necessary preliminary training had been encountered, came
<br/>in crowds to form opinion and to record their judgment. At once
<br/>grappling with the utmost difficulty, Mr. Murdoch first presented
<br/>himself as Hamlet; and a more arduous selection could not
<br/>have been made, both as regards the part itself and the prestige of
<br/>many “ illustrious predecessors,” several of whom have so identified
<br/>themselves with Hamlet, that it is cot easy to have an idea of the</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p291"/>
         </p>
         <p>character which is not incorporated, as it were, with them. But
<br/>Mr. Murdoch’s personation was triumphantly received—rarely, if
<br/>ever, have we heard such bursts of enthusiastic applause within the
<br/>walls of a theatre, as greeted him throughout, and as followed the
<br/>fall of the curtain. So has it been also, on every night of his ap-
<br/>pearance, the house being crowded by brilliant audiences on each
<br/>occasion; and the experiment may, therefore, be regarded as one of
<br/>the most successful on record.</p>
         <p>And this from the Saturday Courier :
</p>
         <p>The success of this gentleman, since his return to the stage, has
<br/>been most gratifying to his friends, and a source, we doubt not, of
<br/>great felicitation to himself. From our too settled servility hitherto
<br/>to foreign dictation in theatrical affairs, it was to be feared that na-
<br/>tive genius, however eminent, would not excite sufficient interest to
<br/>insure a fair hearing. But in the case of Mr. Murdoch, that fear
<br/>has been entirely dissippated, especially in this, his native city.,
<br/>where his houses have been thus far crowded from pit to dome, with
<br/>most intelligent and attentive audiences. To say that Mr. Mur-
<br/>doch who was ever a favorite, has greatly improved since he has
<br/>left the stage, would be but a faint expression, in regard to one who
<br/>has grasped with a nervous arm, an unfaltering foot, an indomita-
<br/>ble resolution, the very highest range of his profession. His read-
<br/>ings, points, and bearings evince the close and hearty study he has
<br/>accorded to their perfection, and his audiences appear keenly alive
<br/>to their many beauties.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Murdoch has performed, during the present week,
<br/>another brilliant and triumphant engagement in this same
<br/>city. In our notices of the Theatre, we shall always have
<br/>an eye to its reform and elevation. We are, in this re-
<br/>spect, on the eve of a great dramatic Revolution.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Miss Cushman, the Actress.—We notice that some of the
<br/>American papers say Miss Cushman has not been doing well at
<br/>the English provincial theatres. There are few, if any, of our own
<br/>celebrated actresses who have pocketed so many English sovereigns
<br/>as our fair American friend, who has so lately left her home and
<br/>country to seek fame and fortune in a foreign land.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Miss Cushman has just completed an engagement of twelve
<br/>nights at Manchester, for which she received 2000 dollars. Her
<br/>engagements at Bristol, Bath, Sheffield, and other places, have been
<br/>excellent and most profitable.—English paper.</p>

</p>
         <p>Another leaf has again been added to Leopold De Mey-
<br/>er’s wreath of laurels, and another two or three thousand
<br/>dollars haye wandered into the pockets of the artist, on
<br/>the occasion of his first Concert, last Friday evening.—
<br/>The Tabernacle was crammed; but this was no more
<br/>than we expected.</p>
         <p>The performance consisted of
</p>
         <p>1.	Duett from Don Giovanni, Mozart, by Madame Ad-
<br/>ler and Signor Ph. Mater. It was rather indifferently
<br/>performed, and the introduction Mr. Perabeau played,
<br/>was altogether out of place ; for, though he behaved like
<br/>a madman, he could not make the audience believe that he
<br/>was a great performer on the Piano. The piece itself
<br/>would have been of more effect in the middle of the per-
<br/>formance.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>2.	Russian Airs, Second Set, composed and performed
<br/>by L. De Meyer. If we never knew what Piano-forte mu-
<br/>sic is, or can be, we might have learned it that evening.
<br/>The most beautiful harmonies, the most delicate passa-
<br/>ges, the most brilliant arpeggios, each one by itself, and
<br/>all combined—this was what the artist offered to an en-
<br/>raptured audience. He was encored, but declined play-
<br/>ing, fearing, perhaps, to be too much fatigued at the end
<br/>of the performance, to do justice to himself.</p>
         <p>3.	Casta Diva, from Norma, Bellini, by Madame Ad-
ler. Perhaps Pico’s Casta Diva, which incessantly
</p>
         <p>haunted our ears that evening, prevented our appreciating
<br/>Madame Adler’s singing. We shall, therefore, wait for
<br/>another opportunity to speak of her style and voice.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>4.	Carnival de Venice arranged and performed by Leo-
<br/>pold De Meyer, was rapturously encored, and Mr. De
<br/>Meyer kindly repeated it, with a different introduction.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>5.	Aria from Lucia di Lammermoor, Donizetti, by
<br/>Signor Ph. Mayer. A little hoarseness which prevailed
<br/>in the beginning, wore off soon, and Mr. Mayer acquitted
<br/>himself exceedingly well.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>6.	Overture to William Tell, arranged and performed
<br/>by L. De Meyer. We have in vain ransacked the dic-
<br/>tionaries of Webster, Walker, and others—no words could
<br/>be found to express the effect produced by this composi-
<br/>tion. We will leave it, therefore, to our readers to ima-
<br/>gine to themselves something so beautiful as to be indes-
<br/>cribable, and they will have something like Mr. De Mey-
<br/>er’s performance of Rossini’s Overture.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>7.	Recitative and Grand Aria, from Massaniello, by
<br/>Madame Adler. Much better sung than the former pie-
<br/>ces of this lady. It would have gained her at once the
<br/>good-will of the audience, if the brilliant roulades and
<br/>coleratures at the end had not spoiled all the effect.—
<br/>More scale singing we would recommend to this lady.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>8.	Grand March, Marocaine, by Leopold De Meyer.
<br/>That the house did not break down under the thunder of
<br/>applause is the only thing we wonder at, and we would
<br/>advise all artists, who think of producing such a sensa-
<br/>tion as Mr. De Meyer, to secure the Tabernacle, if they
<br/>will not risk the lives of their audience. After being en-
<br/>cored, Mr. De Meyer gave us a fantasie on Yankee Doo-
<br/>dle, improvised or not, we cannot say ; but it is so short,
<br/>was the last word of thousands, as they left the Taber-
<br/>nacle, highly delighted with the evening’s entertainment.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Huber, the Violoncellist, the Composer, the Pianist—lor all
<br/>of these is he, although the violoncello is the instrument of his
<br/>heart, and his choice shows the earnestness of his musical feeling
<br/>and the purity of his taste,—is attracting more and more the atten-
<br/>tion of the musical connoisseurs and the public. It is only from
<br/>his unaffected simplicity and freedom from all display, that he has
<br/>not created as great an excitement among the public generally.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Upon this, the most expressive of all instruments, his power is
<br/>very great The most touching, the most passionate strains, notes
<br/>of flute-like delicacy and arpeggio passages, whose full tone fills
<br/>the saloon like the swell of an organ, come from his magic bow
<br/>with the same facility.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>His compositions are replete with passages of great feeling and
<br/>power, and though in a style peculiar to himself, have much of
<br/>that passionate earnestness and abandon which is found in the
<br/>compositions of Schubert.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To the above remarks, from the Evening Gazette, we
<br/>only add, that he is a Piano manufacturer at the same
<br/>time. We have tried an instrument of his make, and in
<br/>many points find it superior to those of Erard. It is a
<br/>great deal lower in price. We understand the chief ob-
<br/>ject of Mr. H. is to establish a manufactory of grand
<br/>pianos in this city.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>U. C. Hill's Festival Concert.—Between three and
<br/>four thousand people made the walls of the Tabernacle
<br/>resound with their bravos and encores during the evening.
<br/>It was a Festival Concert in the true meaning of the
<br/>word. Chorists and Solists all tried their utmost; the
<br/>orchestra was never better than on this occasion. Be-
<br/>sides Leopold De Meyer, who drew down thunders of
<br/>applause, no one astonished the audience more than Mr.
<br/>Boucher. For the last four years he had not played in pub-
<br/>lic,and here he comes out with a beautiful composition of
<br/>his own, the performance of which would have given
<br/>credit to a Servais, Franchomme, or Knoop.</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p292"/>
         </p>
         <p>We hope Mr. Boucher will no longer withhold from
<br/>the public his talent and genius. Nothing serves more
<br/>to make the violincello popular than such playing.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Miss Northall sang the Duett of Eliza el Claudio in
<br/>good style; in fact, better than on former occasions. This
<br/>young lady is destined, if she keeps on, to adorn all our
<br/>public concerts and musical festivals. Mr. Meyer sup-
<br/>ported her well.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Madame Otto, has, it seems, improved in voice and
<br/>style during her late absence from this country. In questo
<br/>semplice could not have been sung better. Her higher
<br/>notes are clear as silver bells.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Messrs. Kyle and Aupick did their part well, and only
<br/>want of space prevents our going more into detail. We
<br/>hope we shall have another opportunity to speak of the
<br/>merits of these two eminent musicians.</p>
         <p>Now, Mr. Hill, the sooner you get up another Festival
Concert, the better for the public and yourself.
Miss Bramson gives a Concert to-night (Tuesday even-
ing) at Niblo’s, which we shall notice in our next.
</p>
         <p>Mr. Wollenhaupt, a young pianist, lately arrived
<br/>from Leipzig, makes quite a sensation amongst musicians.
<br/>He is a pupil of the Leipzig Conservatoire.</p>
         <p>Ole Bull plays again on Thursday evening in Phila-
delphia.
Lucia di Lammermoor will be brought out next week
at the Park, with Miss Delcy as Prima Donna.
</p>
         <p>L. De Meyer has announced his second Concert for
<br/>Friday next. He will be assisted by Miss Northall, Ma-
<br/>dame Lazare and Mr. P. Mayer.</p>

</p>
         <p>The Churchman and Dr. Cheever.—The Churchman
<br/>is no friend to Dr. Cheever, his theology and his opin-
<br/>ions, and from our own reflections, we can easily under-
<br/>stand how a difference may arise in the premises. But
<br/>we can see nothing in the case to justify the spirit of an
<br/>article, in the last number of that organ, on the “Wander-
<br/>ings of a Pilgrim.” In the first place the price is printed
<br/>wrong, apparently with design, for the sake of a joke long
<br/>since discarded by penny-a-liners. Price 3s. 6d. In the
<br/>first place this is not the price of the book, which is le-
<br/>gibly printed on the cover thirty-seven and a half cents.
<br/>Supposing it were forty-four cents—what joke can there
<br/>be in British shillings and pence that there is not in Ame-
<br/>rican currency ? Yet such is the fact to the theological
<br/>critic (not the editor) of the Churchman. The reading
<br/>of that man must have been miserably confined even
<br/>among the book shelves of his own creed. The spirits
<br/>of Old Latimer and of South and of Fuller and of Cor-
<br/>bet and of Sterne and of Swift, should rise up and thrust
<br/>such a witling as that from even the outer court of the
<br/>sanctuary ! He is a disgrace to a church renowned
<br/>for wit and humor and the soul of the gentleman.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>What follows is of a piece for candor—a passage be-
<br/>ing isolated and battered with dirty adjectives till we
<br/>confound the innocent words with the shabbiness thrown
<br/>upon it. With a foul mouth you may thus mar the white-
<br/>ness of the Parian marble. If a dirty fellow will brush
<br/>against a gentleman, the gentleman will be mistaken for
<br/>a dirty fellow, and in this way vulgar and malevolent
<br/>critics vilify pure authors.</p>
         <p>Just censure is one thing, and this wholesale abuse is
another. It is very possible that a practised knight of
</p>
         <p>the quill might prick Dr. Cheever gracefully, and the
<br/>public might be gratified at the spectacle, for the public
<br/>loves to see an author tickled; but the public requires
<br/>this spiriting to be done “gently”, and has no affection
<br/>for the weapons of fish-women or scavengers, clerical or
<br/>otherwise.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Upcott, the great collector of Autographs, re-
<br/>cently died at his residence near London. His house
<br/>has been often visited by American tourists to whom he
<br/>was uniformly courteous, showing them the unique treas-
<br/>ures of his house, literally lined with books, and being
<br/>led by them too often to anticipate the sale of a portion
<br/>of his collections in this country. When we saw him
<br/>some years since, he was daily expecting letters from
<br/>the United States respecting such a purchase for some
<br/>twenty thousand dollars! He was anxious that his col-
<br/>lections should be unbroken. He would choose a par-
<br/>ticular topic, and cm up books and magazines and news-
<br/>papers till he had exhausted the subject. He had such
<br/>a collection of cuttings from newspapers contempora-
<br/>ry with the American Revolution and relating to that
<br/>struggle, which Mr. Brodhead purchased and presented

         <p>Picture of New-York.—We have seen some exceed-
<br/>ingly beautiful wood cuts, forming a part of a pictorial
<br/>description of New-York city. Among the designs
<br/>furnished are views of ten Episcopal, two Unitari-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>an, three Presbyterian, and several other Churches; the
<br/>Deaf and Dumb Asylum, Society Library, Bloomingdale
<br/>Asylum, Blind Asylum, &amp;c., together with several Brook-
<br/>lyn buildings, viz: First Unitarian Church, Church of
<br/>the Pilgrims, the Long Island Tunnel.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This volume, we are informed, will comprise about
<br/>200 pages, including forty illustrations by the best wood
<br/>engravers of New-York, and will be published by Messrs.
<br/>Homans &amp; Ellis early next month. Our city has long
<br/>wanted a pictorial guide book for the use of strangers
<br/>and citizens ; and the specimens before us lead us to think
<br/>that justice will be done to some of our noble institutions,
<br/>especially those of a charitable order.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Messrs. Humans A Ellis have also in hand, preparing
<br/>by a resident clergyman, a brief account of all the
<br/>Churches in Brooklyn and New-York, with numerous il-
<br/>lustrations.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It is to be hoped that every facility will be afforded by
<br/>clergymen to the publishers to enable them to furnish a
<br/>work whose details may be relied upon. One fact is al-</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p293"/>
         </p>
         <p>ready elicited by the enquiries instituted, viz: that there
<br/>are forty-two churches erected in the city of Brooklyn,
<br/>and forty-five congregations, three of whom worship in
<br/>temporary rooms. This is probably a larger number of
<br/>Churches than are contained in any city with a similar
<br/>number of inhabitants, say 60,000.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The drawing we now give is of St. Thomas’ Church,
<br/>in Broadway, at the corner of Houston. It is one of the
<br/>most beautiful structures of which our city may boast. Its
<br/>dimensions are 62 feet in width, 113 feet in depth ; built
<br/>of dark stone, in the Gothic order, with two towers, each
<br/>80 feet high.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Biographical, Ancestrical and Romantic Items from
<br/>late European Journals.—The daily papers give but a
<br/>brief abstract of the foreign intelligence on the arrival of
<br/>the Steamers, chiefly confined to a few dry political facts,
<br/>the price current, with a stray anecdote or two of a dwarf
<br/>or a calf with two heads. It is singular how uniformly
<br/>a few passages of the latter description come up, on such
<br/>occasions, in the papers. A man snatches at an ‘extra’
<br/>in great haste and, ten to one, his eye first alights upon
<br/>some such important item as the delivery of five children
<br/>at a birth in one of the Orkney Islands. The finest por-
<br/>tions, the gems of the literary, scientific and artistical
<br/>world, are scantily given, if not altogether neglected. We
<br/>have thought the endeavor to supply this defect might
<br/>meet with favor, from our readers, and have gleaned the
<br/>following paragraphs, none of which are likely to be met
<br/>with in the newspapers of the day. If the plan meets
<br/>with favor we shall continue it. For our own part, we
<br/>think we are supplying a deficiency, and that our columns
<br/>could not be better employed.</p>
         <p>Item i. A new work by Ariosto !
</p>
         <p>From Florence, we heard of a discovery ot great interest which
<br/>has just been made by Signor Zampieri conservator of the Grand
<br/>Ducal Library. Amongst the manuscripts in that establishment he
<br/>has found one containing the greater part of an epic poem by
<br/>Ariosto, of which hitherto the existence was unknown—and whose
<br/>title is Rinaldo l' Ardito ('Rinaldo the Bold’). The work has been
<br/>originally composed of 244 octave verses, divided into twelve can-
<br/>tos; of which the first, the beginning of the second, and the sixth
<br/>are wanting in the manuscript in question. The Grand Duke has
<br/>ordered its publication, at the government expense; and directed
<br/>that a copy shall be sent to each of the great libraries of Europe, in
<br/>the hope that a search will br made in those various institutions for
<br/>the absent portions of the poem.</p>
         <p>Item ii. News of Tycho Brahe.
</p>
         <p>From Copenhagen, too, we have accounts of a discovery of in-
<br/>terest—which we report as we find it, though we think it probable
<br/>there is some mistake in the terms. They state that professor
<br/>Heiberg, who is occupied in collecting materials for a History of
<br/>the Lite and Labors of the Illustrious Swedish Astronomer Tycho
<br/>Brahe,—which he purposes publishing in the course of next year,;
<br/>wherein will fall the 300th anniversary of the birth of the great
<br/>savant—lately caused searches and excavations to be made amongst
<br/>the ruins of the Chateau and Observatory of Tycho, in the little,
<br/>Swedish Isle of Hvcen, situate in the Sound, which was the pro-
<br/>perly of the latter. These researches have, it is said, produced some
<br/>curious results. A number of the tools used by the philosopher for
<br/>the construction of his astronomical instruments have been found,
<br/>—many of the completed instruments themselves, and some in an
<br/>unfinished state—and several manuscripts in the Latin language,
<br/>bearing the signature of Tycho Brahe, and containing astronomi-
<br/>cal observations, reflections on the events of his day, and occasion-
<br/>al poetry.</p>
         <p>Item III. A Jewel-Fountain in South America,
</p>
         <p>Last week, says the London Athenæum, we gave our readers
<br/>some account—Irom a report sent by the French Consul to his
<br/>government,—of a diamond mine which has been discovered in
<br/>the Province of Bahia , and we have since found some details in
<br/>a Brazilian paper,—which we are tempted to quote, for the singu-
<br/>lar effect produced by a narrative of facts that can only be given
<br/>in language recalling the marvels of Oriental fiction. “ Some
<br/>years ago," says the journal in question, “ veins of gold were ac-
<br/>cidentally discovered in the Assuara; and a crowd of contrabandists
<br/>soon flocked to that desert portion of Bahia—situate not far from
<br/>the southern banks of San Francisco—in search of fortune. The</p>
         <p/>
         <p>gold, however, was but the harbinger of more marvellous wealth
<br/>ere long to be found. The labors of the miner extended on every
<br/>side; and diamond-strata were soon discovered, of richness incal-
<br/>culable. In every stream and on every hill of these districts, and
<br/>of the vast plain of Sincara, treasures inestimable, in gold and pre-
<br/>cious stones, presented themselves spontaneously to the hand of man.
<br/>Attracted by the rumour, multitudes of emigrants from the town
<br/>and province of Bahia, from Minas, and even from Rio Janerio,
<br/>crowded thither to quench the universal thirst at this jewel-foun-
<br/>tain. It is scarcely three years since the first ounce of gold was
<br/>found in this region—then a desert; and it contains already a pop-
<br/>ulation exceeding forty thousand souls. It would be difficult, says
<br/>this journal, to credit all that is told of the product of these new
<br/>mines, if the letters and reports of trust-worthy eye-witnesses did
<br/>not confirm the wildest of them. One letter says, “ Gold is com-
<br/>mon and abundant in every brook, and throughout the entire dis-
<br/>trict ; but no man regards it—all are gathering diamonds.” “ Our
<br/>readers may form an idea,” the paper adds, “ of the importance of
<br/>these treasures, when they know that a single packet-ship exported
<br/>lately, from Bahia to Europe, diamonds to the amount of 1,000
<br/>contos des reis (upwards of 106,000._) although the larger portion
<br/>of these precious stones are carried first to Rio Janerio,—where,
<br/>because of a greater abundance of capital and better acquaintance
<br/>with the sort of traffic, they fetch higher prices.”</p>
         <p>Item iv. Two anecdotes for Bibliomaniacs—Gold and
Fame.
</p>
         <p>A Precious Volume.—A curious circumstance occurred last
<br/>week at the sale of the books of the late Dean of Lincoln.—
<br/>Amongst the persons attracted was Mr. John Deighton, the book-
<br/>seller, of Cambridge: he was looking over the lots shortly before
<br/>the auction commenced, when on taking up a copy of Doane’s
<br/>'Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell,’ he thought the volume felt
<br/>very’ ponderous; and on examining it, he discovered that in the
<br/>book-binder’s "fly-leaf,” at the beginning, several coins were sew-
<br/>ed. He called the attention of the auctioneer to the circumstance;
<br/>and it was ascertained that a manuscript letter was fastened to the
<br/>leaf, and that seven guineas and two half-guineas of the reign of
<br/>Charles II. were strongly sewed within, like so many buttons. The
<br/>coins were quite bright and fresh ; and though many of the books
<br/>in the library were sadly damaged by damp and neglect, this vol-
<br/>ume and its contents had escaped injury for the lapse of 160 years.</p>
         <p>The letter had no signature, but from its style seemed to be the
writing of a father to his son at one of the universities. The lot,
made interesting by this circumstance, was withdrawn from the
auction.—Stanford Mercury.
</p>
         <p>The Gazette des Tribunaux furnishes an anecdote from one of the
<br/>bye-ways of Parisian life, which is worth reporting in the Athenæ-
<br/>um rather for its touching character than lor any direct relation
<br/>which it has to literature. Some days since, a widow, keeping a
<br/>well-known book-stall near the Pont St. Michel, was addressed by
<br/> an old man, to whom his load of wretchedness seemed a heavier
<br/>burthen than even that of his years. From beneath an old tattered</p>
         <p/>
         <p> garment the stooping man drew forth a thick volume, torn and
<br/>stained by long use; and offering it to the book-dealer, said:—
<br/>“Intrinsically this is worth a mere nothing: it had a value to
<br/>me, however; but I have not the courage to let myself die of
<br/>my hunger,—so give me for it what you will.” The volume
<br/>in question was the “ History of Astronomy amongst all Nations,”
<br/>by Bailly; and, in its worn-cut condition, was dear at 50
<br/>centimes;—but, the female merchant, pitying its owner’s destitu-
<br/>tion, gave him a franc; and the latter immediately entering a
<br/>baker's shop, brought out a portion of a loaf, and sat down to eat it
<br/>solitary by the river’s side. M. G—, a canon of Notre Dame and
<br/>hunter of the book-stalls in this neighborhood, had been a witness
<br/>of the scene; and taking up the book when the old man was gone,
<br/>he found on the reverse of the title-page the following lines, firmly
<br/>traced, but whose ink had assumed the color of rust"—"My young
<br/>friend, I am condemned to die;—at this hour to-morrow I shall be
<br/>no more. I leave you friendless in the world—in a time of dread-
<br/>ful trouble; and that is one of my bitterest griefs. I had promised
<br/>to be a father to you;—God wills that my promise shall not be per-
<br/>formed. Take this volume as the pledge of my earnest love—
<br/>and keep it in memory of me.—Bailly.” Deeply affected by this
<br/>one record of such varied miseries, at the opposite extremes of fifty
<br/>years, the canon flung two francs to the merchant lor her bargain,
<br/>—and hastened with it to the old man, of whom he had net
<br/>for a moment lost sight. From the latter, he learned that</p>
         <p/>
         <p>he was the natural son of a person of high rank; had been,
<br/>Waller his father’s death, the pupil and almost the adopted
<br/>child of Bailly; and that, on the eve of his death, the illus-
<br/>trious martyr sent to him this copy of the work which, in 1784, had
<br/>opened to himself the doors of the Academy. This unfortunate
<br/>pupil of an unfortunate master, after having been long engaged
<br/>in the business of public instruction, had been attacked by illness,
<br/>which compelled him to resign his functions; and had since been
<br/>gradually sinking into the slate of destitution, under whose gnaw-
<br/>ing promptings he had turned the last gift of his benefactor and
<br/>friend into bread. The canon took the old man to his home; and
<br/>has since labored successfully to procure his admission into the
<br/>hospital of Laronchefoucauld—where the remainder of his days
<br/>are sure, at least, of temporal comforts.</p>

         <p>A Pension to Tennyson.—It is stated in the ‘ Cam-

<br/>per annum from her Majesty, at the recommendation of

ELEGANT NEW WORK.
C. SHEPARD, BOOKSELLER, 191 BROADWAY.
</p>
         <p>CHAUNT OF LIFE—and other Poems, by Rev. R. Hoyt, a
<br/>Clergyman of the Episcopal Church, New York. Parts 1 &amp; 2.
<br/>This work is beautifully printed on fine paper, embellished, and
<br/>handsomely bound. Price 37 1/2 cents.</p>
         <p>The following are extracts from a few of the notices it has re-
ceived from the Press:—
</p>
         <p>“There is a natural vigor in this poem (World for Sale) which
<br/>is wrung from the life,—a wild music from the very heartstrings.”
<br/>—Morning News.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ This is a scene (snow) that every one will recognize as life-
<br/>like and truthful,—no artist could paint it better.”—Hud. Riv.
<br/>Chronicle.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ We have seen many quartos, not taken either from the lowest
<br/>rank of dullness, with far less that is acceptable in them.”—Dem.
<br/>Review.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ We commend this volume to the lover of true poetry, and can
<br/>say, in all sincerity, if Mr. Hoyt, in his following numbers, sus-
<br/>tains the character of this, there is no doubt of his success."—N.</p>
         <p>Y. Evening Mirror.
</p>
         <p>“ It is printed in a very neat and even elegant style, worthy of
<br/>the grace, delicacy and beauty of the poems.”—N. Y. Courier and
<br/>Enquirer.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ He writes with grace, taste and genius, and many of his pro-
<br/>ductions possess merit of the highest order. Some of his best
<br/>pieces will be incorporated in a new edition of the Poets and
<br/>Poetry of America.”—Phil. Nat. Gazette.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“We give a stanza from the principal poem in the volume,
<br/>commending this delicious little brochure as one of the best New
<br/>Year’s presents that could be selected.”—N. Y. Express.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ The Chaunt is one of the finest modern poems that we have
<br/>read this many a day, and abounds in highly wrought and beautiful
<br/>passages. The author, Rev. Ralph Hoyt, is destined to a high
<br/>rank in the American temple ol poetry, and we heartily thank
<br/>him for providing us such a rare poetic feast as he has given us
<br/>in this volume.”—N. Y. Rambler.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Full of delicate description, perfect truth and beauty of senti-
<br/>ment; and style pure and limpid as the chrystal stream, all envel-
<br/>oped in a charming atmosphere of grace and piety and purest im-
<br/>agination. It is a gem and a noble offering,’’— Churchman.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Part II. contains the second canto of a very fine poem,—the
<br/>Chaunt of Life; From the first stanza we quote three remarkably
<br/>beautiful lines. The fourth and fifth stanzas are very noble.—
<br/>The poem Old has so many rare and peculiar excellences, that
<br/>we shall venture to copy it in full.”—Broadway Journal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ The Chaunt of Life is like the opening of some glorious ma
<br/>jestic strain of music, through which the mournful spirit of the
<br/>past gives lone and unutterable earnestness to the aspirations of
<br/>the present and the hopes of the future. Such strains as those ot
<br/>our author will be heard. They sink at once into the heart and
<br/>abide there.”—Prot. Churchman.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ We have not seen a volume in a year that we have been more
<br/>taken with than this. It is a pleasure to meet an author who can,
<br/>like Mr. Hoyt, make his theories attractive and bis method strik-
<br/>ing without setting up lor a misanthrope, or invoking the aid of
<br/>the infernals.—Phil. Sat. Eve. Post.</p>

NARRATIVE OF A MISSION TO BOKHARA.
In the year 1843-45, to ascertain the fate of Col. Stoddart and
Capt. Conolly.
By the Rev. Joseph Wolff L.L.D.
</p>
         <p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<br/>England: it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<br/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography ; the narrative
<br/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<br/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<br/>East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this
<br/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<br/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<br/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<br/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious
<br/>about tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that
<br/>the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirm-
<br/>ing far too little of so striking a production : it is a book that ought
<br/>to he read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
<br/>its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work
<br/>is elegantly primed as a library hook, and adorned by some dozen
<br/>curious facsimiles of oriental drawings."— Courier and Enquirer.</p>

J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURER Of THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
JF. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties
imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
</p>
         <p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of
<br/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
<br/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-
<br/>ture, imported in the usual way.</p>
         <p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention
N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects froth this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
</p>
         <p>Mr. J. F. Browns, Sir:—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of
<br/>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
<br/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.</p>
         <p>January, 1845	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
</p>
         <p>Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city.—
<br/>The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old
<br/>Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other. Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST
<br/>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society
<br/>Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps.
<br/>The grand six and a hall Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
<br/>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-
<br/>ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
<br/>ease of modulation, they arc superior to any I have used ; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
<br/>Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world ; it will give me great pleasure
<br/>in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.</p>
         <p>January 12th, 1845	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
</p>
         <p>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of
<br/>making a correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid

         <p>Doct. S's experience and skill in his profession, give him con-
<br/>fidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any
<br/>Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
<br/>varies in many essential points from the usual mode ; and his suc-
<br/>cess in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
<br/>difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
<br/>of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
<br/>same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
<br/>artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
<br/>natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
<br/>natural appearance. In all these points, Doct S.'s manner is pre-
<br/>eminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to
<br/>surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
<br/>generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
<br/>makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and in cases
<br/>where the gum has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
<br/>the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
<br/>causes a contraction of the lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of
<br/>which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
<br/>which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
<br/>redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, ren-
<br/>der detection impossible.</p>
         <p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
the best families in this City, in which he has practised.

sidences, by sending their addresses above,	nov. 8—9t

         <p>*Caution. —Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in
<br/>this market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to com-
<br/>pare the Hyson tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine arti- 
<br/>cle that the Company offer at the same price. The difference is so 
<br/>perceptible on trial as to render any further comment unnecessary. 
<br/>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<br/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<br/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<br/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
<br/>price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F.
<br/>Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
<br/>in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
<br/>and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpow-
<br/>der and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a com-
<br/>bination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poi-
<br/>son. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and
<br/>deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them</p>
         <p>above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas
retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine
article sold by the Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed,
wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
giving full details on this subject, which may be had at their 
Warehouse, 75 Fulton street, free of charge.
RECOMMENDATIONS.
</p>
         <p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one dollar per
<br/>pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea
<br/>from them at 75 rents per pound. We drink one pound peer week, by which
<br/>we are now saving thirteen dollars per year, and enjoying better tea in the
<br/>bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea Company, say we.—Mirror.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Pekin Tea Company, 73 Fulton street, are performing a great and good
<br/>work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the poor teas which
<br/>have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers of the article, out of the
<br/>market. They import none but pure and fragrant teas, and retail them by the
<br/>single pound at wholesale prices. Families are always sure of obtaining good
<br/>teas at this great tea warehouse, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at
<br/>the same price that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—Daily True
<br/>Sun. </p>
         <p>You may be sure of obtaining at all limes, pure and highly flavored tens, by
the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Company, 79 Fulton
street.—They have probably the largest stock, and greatest variety of fine
green and black teas, of any one establishment in the United States. They 
are doing a large business, and a great benefit to consumers of tea. —Atlas.
Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always obtain
green and black teas. But now you only have to visit the warerooms of 
the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as delicious and fragrant
teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.
If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of the Pekin
Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—Mercury.

         <p>have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dollars worth of
<br/>the finest grades of Green and Black Teas grown in the Celestial Empire, don
<br/>up in all the various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is
<br/>a privilege to buy teas at this great establishment, and a luxury and comfort
<br/>to drink them They sell good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices .
<br/>Country merchants who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them
<br/>at this place, on reasonable terms.—Emporium.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Tiie Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
<br/>lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
<br/>warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors en-
<br/>ables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the public. We know
<br/>that their Teas, both in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many
<br/>a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
<br/>in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length he has become hopeless
<br/>of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market a kind
<br/>which had not such an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agree-
<br/>ably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
<br/>of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor-cultivated and
<br/>packed with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into this
<br/>country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have an Oolong,
<br/>mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
<br/>nervous persons, its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
<br/>to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
<br/>never before drank such tea. But all tastes can here be suited, with the great
<br/>advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, how-
<br/>ever small the quantity. The Company's Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—
<br/>New World.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75 Fulton street, unquestionably sell
<br/>the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them cheaper than any
<br/>other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand instances since they have
<br/>opened their store.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t wish to
<br/>buy. at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter, entitled “ Hints
<br/>to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful information on the subject.</p>
         <p>The pamphlet is given gratis.—Anglo American.

<br/>imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street. Those who want good
<br/>teas at reasonable prices, can always get them there.—Tribune.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,
<br/>and if we live will try them often. They are selling the most delicious teas
<br/>we ever drank, and ret it them at wholesale prices.—Evening Post. oct8</p>
