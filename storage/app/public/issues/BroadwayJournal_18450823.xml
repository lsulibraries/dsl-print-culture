            <br></br>Far removed from mortal view,
            
            <br></br>In the depth of Heaven’s blue
            
            <br></br>Where planets weave their robe of beams,
            
            <br></br>I wandered, wandered on in dreams:
            
            <br></br>I’ll tell thee what I saw.
            
            <br></br>Gazing with a thoughtful eye
            
            <br></br>On the star-ships floating by,
            
            <br></br>In a calm and thoughtful mood
            
            <br></br>A beauteous angel stood;
            
            <br></br>On her I gazed.
            
            <br></br>At last she took a diamond pen,
            
            <br></br>And alabaster tablet—then
            
            <br></br>She swiftly wrote a moment, when
            
            <br></br>I heard her whisper—(how her eyes
            
            <br></br>Shone luminous as of Paradise!)—
            
            <br></br>‘ I have gazed over scenes below and above
            
            <br></br>And learned that Creation existeth through Love,
            
            <br></br>Only through Love!’
            
            <br></br>How precious a record of bliss!
            
            <br></br>How priceless a treasure is this!
            
            <br></br>Teaching that ever below and above
            
            <br></br>The orbs are all ringed by the sweet ring of Love!—
            
            <br></br>“Give it me!—Give it me, Spirit!”—I cried
            
            <br></br>And this was the answer that came in a tide
            
            <br></br>Of rich tones
            
            <br></br>From the Angel of God
            
            <br></br>Who was borne by the heavenly thrones:—
            
            <br></br>“It is thine! Keep it safe on thy heart;
            
            <br></br>’Tis the talisman charmed below and above;
            
            <br></br>It will lead thee when thou must depart
            
            <br></br>From thy Earth
            
            <br></br>To the Edens where spirits have birth—

         <p>True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been
            and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disuse had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled
            them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
            all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many
            things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole
            story.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my
            brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.
            Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved
            the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
            given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it
            was his eye! yes, it was this! He bad the eye of a vulture
            —a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and
            thus rid myself of the eye forever.
         </p>
         
         <p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen
            know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should
            have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—
            with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to
            work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the
            whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my
            head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no
            light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you
            would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I
            moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my
            whole head within the opening so far that I could see him
            as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman have been
            so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the
            room, I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously
            —cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—I undid it just
            so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.
            And this I did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
            broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would
            have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that
            every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he
            slept.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious
            in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more
            quickly than did mine. Never before that night, had I felt
            the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could
            scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that
            there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on
            the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I
            drew back—but no.	His room was as black as pitch with
            the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened,
            through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see
            the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily,
            steadily.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when
            my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
            sprang up in the bed, crying out—“Who’s there?”
         </p>
         
         <p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I
            did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear
            him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;
            —just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the
            death watches in the wall.
         </p>
         
         <p>Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the
            
            
            groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of
            grief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from
            the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew
            the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all
            the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.
            I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
            pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he
            had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when
            he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since
            growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them
            causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself—
            “It is nothing but the wind in the chimney—it is only a
            mouse crossing the floor,” or “it is merely a cricket which
            has made a single chirp.” Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all
            in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him
            had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within
            the room.
         </p>
         
         <p>When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without
            hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very,
            very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily—until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out thecrevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I
            gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull
            blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
            man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
         </p>
         
         <p>And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses?—now, I say, there
            came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch
            makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well,
            too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased 
            my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into
            courage.
         </p>
         
         <p>But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I
            could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder
            every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you
            that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of
            the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so
            strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror, j
            Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But
            the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
            burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would
            be heard by a neighbour! The old man’s hour had come!
            With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into
            the room. He shrieked once—once only.	In an instant I
         </p>
         <p>dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him.
            
         </p>
         <p>I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for
            many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This,
            however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the
            wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone,
            stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it
            there many minutes. There was no pulsation, He was
            stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer
            when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily,
            but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut
            off the head and the arms and the legs.
         </p>
         
         <p>I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human
            eye—not even his—could have detected any thing wrong.
            There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no
            blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub
            had caught all—ha! ha!
         </p>
         
         <p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’
            clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour,
            there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to
            open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear?
            There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with
            perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been
            heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul
            play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the
            police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search
            the premises.
         </p>
         
         <p>I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen
            welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The
            old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my
            visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search
            well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them
            his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my
            confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them
            here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild
            audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the
            very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
         </p>
         
         <p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
            them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere
            long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My
            head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
            they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—it continued and became more distinct: I talked
            more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and
            gained definitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise
            was not within my ears.
         </p>
         
         <p>No doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound
            —much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in
            cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it
            not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the
            noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in
            a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise
            steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to
            fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily
            increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved
            —I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over
            all and continually increased. It grew louder—louder—
            louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled.
            Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no!
            They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I
            think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
            those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream
            or die!—and now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder!
            louder!—
         </p>
         
         
         <p>“Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the
            deed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—it is the beating
            of his hideous heart!”

            <br></br>But beams in vain, for ah! I cannot find
            
            <br></br>In Art, or thought, a solace for my mind;
            
            <br></br>The heart that’s broken by lost love or friend
            
            <br></br>Thought cannot soothe, and Art can never mend.
            
            <br></br>I turn, in mem'ry, to those days of joy,
            
            <br></br>When love and thou did all my time employ;
            
            <br></br>I scan my pictured beauties o’er and o’er,
            
            <br></br>And in their charms, which Artists all adore,
            
            <br></br>Thy form, thy face, thy living self I see,
            
            <br></br>And weep the glories I have lost with thee.
            
            <br></br>When the night wanes, my taper waning too,
            
            <br></br>And the moonbeams my curtains struggle through,
            
            <br></br>And just enough of light is in the room
            
            <br></br>To say that there is light, and not all gloom—
            
            <br></br>O	then! as on my couch I weary lie,
            
            <br></br>Loving the night yet wishing it gone by,
            
            <br></br>Half-waking and half-sleeping I recline,
            
            <br></br>And ill at ease, and restlessly supine:
            
            <br></br>Then Fancy, while my heart throbs high and warm.
            
            <br></br>Tenants again my chamber with thy form—
            
            <br></br>That form, where grace and beauty intertwine,
            
            <br></br>Part sylph, part nymph, part fairy—all divine—
            
            <br></br>Again all glowing to mine own is pressed,
            
            <br></br>Again thy heart is beating to my breast,
            
            <br></br>Those angel-eyes again look into mine,
            
            <br></br>And their long lashes with my own entwine;
            
            <br></br>And in their soul-lit mirrors I can see
            
            <br></br>Two bright reflected miniatures of me,
            
            <br></br>That like the new Camera’s

            </span> graphic art,
            
            <br></br>Straightly convey their types into the heart,
            
            <br></br>And there enshrine them—one for mortal love,
            
            <br></br>The other, thy soul’s consort for above.
            
            <br></br>I	hear again thy voice all eloquent,
            
            <br></br>Again I breathe thy breath all redolent;
            
            <br></br>I feel again wild Passion’s fervent glow,
            
            <br></br>That well might melt thy bosom's virgin snow;
            
            <br></br>I know again the nectar of thy kiss,
            
            <br></br>And my whole soul dissolves itself in bliss.
            
            
            <br></br>O ever blessed, ever joyous dream!
            
            <br></br>O glorious love! my mind’s abiding theme—
            
            <br></br>O	lovely Florence! load-star of my fate!
            
            <br></br>Too lately known, beloved, alas! too late!
            
            <br></br>I	wake, and lo! the beauteous vision’s gone,
            
            <br></br>I wake—distracted, comfortless, alone.
            
            <br></br>Envy has forged her falsehoods on my name,
            
            <br></br>Ungrateful friends have tampered with my fame,
            
            <br></br>Malice pursued me with her venomed guile,
            
            <br></br>And Hate and Wantonness, with lowest wile,
            
            <br></br>Have wrought me evil,—I have all endured,
            
            <br></br>And murmured not, for well I felt assured
            
            <br></br>Of thy sweet love, my solace and my joy;
            
            <br></br>My bright Ideal, that lured me when a boy,
            
            <br></br>The light that beacons me in manhood’s day,
            
            <br></br>Ambition’s lofty efforts to essay!
            
            <br></br>My Fancy paints thee ever to my mind,
            
            <br></br>The fairest, dearest, best of womankind.
            
            <br></br>O’er the vast prairie, o’er the mountain high,
            
            <br></br>O’er the dark river, waft I thee my sigh.
            
            <br></br>Florence, I love thee!—by a soul-bound spell

         <div class="head">Alcibiades Again.
            NEWSPAPERS AND PHILOSOPHY.
         </div>
         
         <p>Not very long after the second symposium, I sank to
            sleep during a summer day, in the portico of my house, and
            then and there received another visit from Alcibiades. With
            him came the same groupe by whom he had been previously
            accompanied, and who I learned were his habitual associates. I did not awake (by some mysterious sympathy, it is
            only when we sleep, that we may have conversation with
            disembodied spirits) but received them, with the welcome
            and deference due to such distinguished personages. The
            day had been exceedingly warm, and the little air which
            found its way through the labyrinthine streets of New York,
            was a sufficient inducement to us to continue where we
            were. It may be, however, that to my friends, fresh from
            the warmer temperature of ενερθεν the weather was not so
            exceedingly oppressive, after all. While we sate discussing
            what old Horatius would have called aliquid nugarum, one
            of the peripatetic bibliopoles, so useful at the same time that
            they are not unfrequently so annoying, passed by with his
            budget of news. While I was paying for the Evening Post
            and the Mirror, Sallustius said: “Of a verity we erred in
            picturing to ourselves fame as a thing feminine. Yon urchin
            were he immortal, would be its fittest type, and I can provide for him an immortal origin, by ascribing to him as
            parents, Mercury and Pauperies, Hermes and Peneia.”
         </p>
         
         <p>To this sally some reply was made by Alcibiades and Aspasia, between whom, there seemed to be much consonance
            of thought. Unfolding the Evening Post, I glanced over its
            columns, premising that its editor was one of the most famed poets of Atlantis. I soon however regretted that I had
            done so, for though I believe in the axiom, vox populi vox
            Dei, I do not think a poet should sully his tongue or stylus
            with the jargon and disputes of the αγορα, even if he used his
            efforts for the exaltation of the human heart. Orpheus, of
            old, sang and thus influenced man; he had no control, and
            sought not for the power of the δίχαοτης. The paper was filled with mere political talk, relating to the Oregon and Texas questions, with which even had my guests been familiar,
            hey must have taken little interest. I laid it aside, and
            
            taking up the Mirror, gave utterance at the same time to an
            enunciation of what I considered its characteristics. The
            Mirror I found void of all things real, with but one paragraph promising to be in the least interesting to my friends;
            and this related to a dancing girl. As they, however, had
            never seen Miss Desjardins, even for that they must have
            cared little. For the meagreness of the papers I apologised
            by a statement that the editors of both were on a pilgrimage
            to the Holy Land of all of Anglo-Saxon descent.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah!” said Alcibiades, “of your journals we were ignorant. Had they been, it is possible the philosophy of the
            porch and garden never would have existed. In those resorts the youth and age of Athens collected, for the purpose
            of hearing what had passed, the course of business in the
            αγορα, the sacrifices offered in the temple of the great Gods,
            and the prophecies of the sooth-sayers. In the thermae, too,
            the poets were wont to assemble to read to each other their
            compositions, the merchants to offer their wares for sale, and
            the sailors to talk over voyages passed or proposed to other
            lands. In fine, all went thither for purposes similar to that
            which prompts you to read yon sheet.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Per Jovem!” said Sallustius, “for that I was too very
            an Epicurean. I always kept a good cook, and each day invited Clodius and seven others to dine with me, who retailed the joint product of their harvest of news.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nay: Sallustius, corrupted by their additions.”</p>
         
         <p>“Minime, made more precious by their ornaments. The
            fact is, I never was a handsome figure. I by no means belonged to the equestrian order, and did not shine in the thermae; and if one did not bathe in the greater hall, it was
            more pleasant to enjoy the bath at home.”
         </p>
         
         <p>" Customs now are different. We print—you have heard
            of that art.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah yes; Doctor Faustus has been below. Pluto had a
            pretty bargain in his soul. We all know him. Does he not
            ever sigh after one Marguerite, translated νησοίς μαχαζων?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Vous parlez comme un oracle antique.’' (By the by,
            it never till now struck me, that all of my visitors had
            the apostolic gift of tongues; for this gallicism of Count Anthony seemed perfectly intelligible to all.) “Yes, we print;
            and the result is, that the publisher has usurped the place
            of the poet, and reaps all the profit of the proudest efforts of
            his genius. Publishing has become a trade like the occupation of the scribes of old, and more than one association
            of these personages have built palaces, while authors starve.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I wonder,” said Alcibiades, “that your countrymen suffer them to stand, cemented as they are by the blood of those
            whose name is the proudest heritage of your land.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“True! but for this inheritance, my countrymen care not.
            With the author they have no sympathy, and see him suffer
            without the elevation either of the voice or hand. Were any
            of the class called by you Τηχνιται so to suffer, popular
            rage could not be restrained.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Thus,” said Shakspeare, “it was in my day. As an author I would have starved. In your art, Oh, Pratinas! though j
            no proficient, the world smiled on me. Hemings and Condell, my old friends, who first collected my plays, made by
            their undertaking no money; and now even they tell me,
            the painter and engraver, who have, as it were, realized my
            Ariel and Titania, are ruined—while the publisher amasses
            money, to be used, perhaps, as an instrument to endorse the
            minds of authors who may come after me.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is so: of this stale of things—nay, of your own case, 
            New York furnishes a striking example.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“So was it not in my day,” said Calderon, a stern and
            
             noble-looking Spaniard, in the garb of Iberia’s proudest day.
            “The nobles of our land would have felt themselves disgraced, had it been said that a votary of any of the Castilian
            Muses starved. One of those authors of whom Spain was
            proudest, and whose writings are a legacy to the world, has
            said: De donde se imfiere que nunca la lanza emboto la pluma ni la pluma la lanza, and the proudest nobles of the
            land were proud to defend the hand that wielded that little
            weapon.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Prenez garde.'” said Count Anthony; “he from whom
            you quote, was a striking character—a soldier as well as author; he had fought with Don John at Lepanto, yet he died,
            if I err not, in a mad-house or some such place.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“A common fate of Poets. Witness Tasso and Lusita-
            nia's, one immortal name,” chimed in Landor.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Cervantes,” said Calderon, “was the exception from
            the fate of my countrymen. I did not starve.”
         </p>
         
         <p>From the manner in which Calderon spoke his last phrase,
            I could see that the shadows preserved their nationality
            below.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ma foi! Sallustius,—what would your contemporaries
            have said relative to a discussion about the literary fate of
            a Celtiberian?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Stranger things than that have happened. Britannia,
            ay, the Ultima Thule—has sent out colonies, to civilize
            lands unknown to us. How far may Atlantis be from Lusitania?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“About 60 days sail.”</p>
         
         <p>“Oh, wonder then not that we know it not. A trip to the
            Cassiteridae for tin, or to Britain, was to my countrymen no
            slight undertaking.”
         </p>
         
         <p>After much desultory conversation, the Drama, ancient and
            modern, was again talked of. Upon this occasion Shakspeare was the speaker. Far be it from me, to attempt to
            shadow forth the ideas of the myriad-minded man. Only
            will I say, that he spoke in the warmest manner of the mode
            of representation, and more unfavourably of the drama itself.
            Of the delight he had experienced in the representation of
            his own plays, no pen can with justice treat. Far had we
            progressed beyond his dreams, by means of the perfection to
            which stage machinery had been carried, and by the thousand artifices made use off to minister to the perfectness of
            dramatic representation. The conversation was extended to
            great length, until the deepening shadows warned us that
            the hour for the play was come.
         </p>
         
         <p>On that evening the play was the “Honey-Moon,” in the
            principal character of which, an actress, from whom use had
            not as yet taken away the feeling and prestige of a debutante, was to appear. The theatre was crowded, yet on this
            occasion, with an audience different from that which we
            had previously seen. The fact is, that play-going people
            were absent from the city, and those who were now to behold the play, were strangers from the remoter parts of the
            country. My guests remarked the appearance of the spectators, but the curtain rose, and conversation ceased. The
            play, constructed according to the canons of the ancient drama,
            they suffered to pass quietly enough. In regard to the actress, they were not so considerate. True; they owned that
            she was beautiful, that her hair was of gold, and her eyes of
            the Cerulean, so much admired in all lands, where such beauty
            is rare. But Aspasia said that she played not the character
            naturally; Xantippe, she had various opportunities of observing, yet never had she seen such representations of passions. She overstepped the mark in the first act, and in the
            last ones came not up to it.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>The debutante, Alcibiades, and all agreed might do much;
            but as yet all was uncertain. She had adopted a profession
            where all but consummate success was utter failure. I cannot be definite relative to their precise criticism, and soon after awoke. Alcibiades promised that some day he would
            come up to witness an αγορα of the people, and I promised
            to accompany him.

         <p>We hope the author of an article entitled “American Letters,” which appeared in the June number of the “American
            Review,” will not accuse us of having purloined his ideas.
            We can assure him that he is not alone in his opinion of the
            softer sex,—that we have even regarded them as an inferior
            order of creation, and have never hesitated to express it; and
            that the accompanying effusion was written to make the true
            meaning of the poet more apparent to their limited capacity.
            Let us not, however, be misunderstood. They are undoubtedly a legitimate part of the human family, and until something can be invented that will supply their place, are to be
            tolerated, and even well treated; but the idea of their pretending to compete with us in anything that requires intellectual ability, is a little too amusing. If our metre is not
            as correct as it should be—we presume it is at least as good
            as that of some of our philosopher-poets—and indeed very
            much in their manner.

            <br></br>He but repeats the sentiments of all the nobler sex,
            
            <br></br>“Pooh! we don't want sense in women!
            
            <br></br>It only injures, and renders them more difficult to manage.
            
            <br></br>We have enough for both. Doubtless you are
            
            <br></br>‘A fair defect of Nature’—still we’re too generous
            
            <br></br>To lay it up against you, for even lordly man
            
            <br></br>Sometimes ' lets down a stitch,’ though ’tis not often.
            
            <br></br>The trails we most admire in the beau sexe
            
            <br></br>Are sweet submission, lovingness—for list the bard—
            
            <br></br>‘ For if thou lovest—mark me, I say lovest—
            
            <br></br>The greatess of thy sex excels thee not.’
            
            <br></br>In other words, the preference of her
            
            <br></br>Who is but one remove from a born natural,
            
            <br></br>Is just as great a compliment, and just as flattering,
            
            <br></br>As that of the most gifted of her sex.
            
            <br></br>‘ The world of affection is thy home,
            
            <br></br>Not that of man’s ambition.’ True, most true!
            
            <br></br>You cannot go to Congress, nor can serve
            
            <br></br>In the militia, nor be heard
            
            <br></br>Within the halls of justice. ’Tis your part
            
            <br></br>To mend his hose—delightful task!
            
            <br></br>And patch his ancient vestments. ‘ In that stillness,
            
            <br></br>Calm and holy, which most becomes a woman,
            
            <br></br>Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart
            
            <br></br>Feeding its flame.’ Canst take a hint?
            
            <br></br>Well, I ’ll explain to you—it simply means
            
            <br></br>Pray keep the fire a-going, but don't intrude
            
            <br></br>Your vapid observations! It is true
            
            <br></br>There is a mighty fuss 'bout female education,
            
            <br></br>But it is all a hum; what we desire
            
            <br></br>Is true affection, not accomplishments.
            
            <br></br>You were made to worship us, and not we you.
            
            <br></br>We are not so requiring—all we ask
            
            <br></br>Is adoration and idolatry. You cannot love too much—
            
            <br></br>What do I say? you cannot love enough! Oh, If eastern customs
            
            
            <br></br>Could but be introduced, you’d have the privilege
            
            <br></br>Of burning for us. Ah, ‘ pleasing, dreadful thought!’
            
            <br></br>To throw yourself upon the funeral pile
            
            <br></br>Of your dead treasure! Well, we are worth it!
            
            <br></br>Perhaps some surly critic will exclaim,
            
            <br></br>If sense is nothing in the female sex,
            
            <br></br>Think of posterity. To that I answer,
            
            <br></br>They’ll have a father, and that’s enough!
            
            <br></br>The feeling most becoming in a woman
            
            <br></br>Is 'just as my husband wishes’—
            
            <br></br>And as affection is the thing we crave,
            
            <br></br>Be liberal in the outward demonstration.
            
            <br></br>Think not of self, nor call your soul your own;
            
            <br></br>But when the loved one steps within his bower
            
            <br></br>Be sure and meet him with a raptured smile,
            
            <br></br>E’en if he’s cross and snappish.
            
            <br></br>If ’tis winter’s cold, prostrate yourself
            
            <br></br>And take his rubbers—or in summer’s heat
            
            <br></br>Fan his moist countenance. ’Tis these tender acts
            
            <br></br>That make life blissful, and he expects them.
            
            <br></br>And oh! let me impress this truth upon you:
            
            <br></br>Ne’er for the world admit you have a wish
            
            <br></br>Or feeling of your own;—’twill cause unhappiness.
            
            <br></br>Soothe him with artless prattle,
            
            <br></br>And should he be oblivious, and speak
            
            <br></br>As if you were a thinking being, gently set him right—
            
            <br></br>‘ How can you, Mr. Higgins, ask such questions?
            
            <br></br>‘ The world of affection is my home,
            
            <br></br>Not that of man’s ambition;’ and it’s all one to me
            
            <br></br>Who’s constable or sheriff, so your neck’s safe.
            
            <br></br>It is enough for me to be the chosen
            
            <br></br>Of a superior being: to be permitted
            
            <br></br>To gaze unchecked upon a manly visage
            
            <br></br>And think it mine, or look upon a brawny fist
            
            <br></br>And say, it never knocked me down or even cuffed me,
            
            <br></br>Big as it is! Oh! what a lovely thing
            
            <br></br>Is power that’s not abused.
            
            <br></br>These are the sentiments we love in woman.
            
            <br></br>A fig for sense, a fig for education!
            
            <br></br>Refinement—mental culture—are no advantage.
            
            <br></br>All we require is this—to know enough
            
            <br></br>To speak when you are spoken to,
            
            <br></br>And come in when it rains.
            
            <br></br>‘ The element of fire is pure, it cannot change its nature,
            
            <br></br>But burns as brightly within the gipsey camp
            
            <br></br>As in the palace hall.’ Be sure it does;
            
            <br></br>And Jock the ploughman feels
            
            <br></br>As genuine a flame toward Sal the housemaid,
            
            <br></br>As that which glows within the poet’s heart,
            
            <br></br>Or, in briefer phrase, one kind of love
            
            <br></br>Is just as good as t’ other.
            
            <br></br>Oh! if the sex could but be made to feel
            
            <br></br>Love and submission are their highest praise,
            
            <br></br>This earth would be a paradise—but, alas!
            
            <br></br>There are too many females who forget
            
            <br></br>This world was made for Caesar—not his wife.
            
            <br></br>All we ask is love, love, love,
            
            <br></br>And all the thousand services which flow from it
            
            <br></br>Of course. I would not be vain-glorious,
            
            <br></br>Nor would claim more than is proper;
            
            <br></br>But to me ’tis plain, that nature gave to us
            
            <br></br>Forms of surpassing beauty, and minds, oh! how superior,
            
            <br></br>Just to make their task an easy one.
            
            <br></br>Milton well has said that ‘ beauty is excelled
            
            <br></br>By manly grace,’ or, in common parlance,
            
            <br></br>That we are ‘ the cock of the walk.’

         <div class="head">A New York Ghost.</div>
         
         <p>The embodied ideas that spontaneously present themselves
            before the vision of nervous or timid persons, are sometimes
            the product of such unsuspectable causes, that it is no wonder such persons are positive in their testimony as to what
            
            they have seen, and are willing to stake their reputation for
            veracity, upon the impression which such visions make upon
            their minds. But persons without the mental disposition to
            convert an unusual appearance into a spectre or thing of horror, would often, under the same circumstances, fail to discover anything peculiar in the same objects that are so prolific of frightfulness in the other case. To see a ghost, and to
            not see one, are two different talents; and it is as reasonable
            to look for the possession of both gifts in every person, as it
            is to expect every man to be alike able to discover a star or
            to peg boots.
         </p>
         
         <p>I almost believe in shadows—flittings of life from another
            existence, hovering around the participants in this—impalpable indeed, but sensible in sight—assuming forms of pleasure or distress, suited to sympathise and accord with our
            mind at the time in which we see them. Let every person
            be satisfied for himself, however, and found his opinion upon
            his own convictions before proclaiming himself a doubter or
            believer.
         </p>
         
         <p>It had been a roasting July day. Utterly unfitted by its
            enervating influence for business, I had languidly idled
            away the time till the shadows began to lengthen, when I
            determined to make a vigorous effort to procure a little air.
            But how was it to be done? In my condition, to walk was
            but to increase the trouble. Riding would be better. Riding, how? On horseback? The exercise would be too violent. A buggy? There I should have to worry with the
            (perhaps vicious) beast. An omnibus? The reeking steam
            of a baker’s dozen crowded in a space for four—oh, awful!
            A cab? A cab! a cab—the very thing; here would be no
            difficulty; with all the windows and myself the only occupant—here I could surely breathe and be refreshed. I stepped into a cab—ordered the driver “windward”—threw back
            my coat, and put myself in readiness to catch the first breath
            created by the rushing vehicle. The horse was speedy and
            the breeze grew high. A luxurious drowsiness overcame
            me, and I was fast sinking into a refreshed unconsciouness
            of heat or cold, when — thunder! I was thrown with such
            violence upon my back, that lor a moment I was stunned and
            insensible. On recovering, I found myself lying in the street.
            The cab had struck an omnibus and overset, forcing me violently through the unfastened door behind. Bruised and
            aching, I sought my lodging, and in despair my bed. A golden spray, dashed by the setting sun into the room, enveloped me, as I strode down the darkening way into the realms
            of Sleep.
         </p>
         
         <p>I was wandering through a narrow dell in the forest—a
            deep ravine rugged with rocks, and overgrown with shrubbery and tangled briars, that scratched and tore my flesh at
            every step; while myriads of serpents, hissing, trailed across
            my path. At the bottom ran a glistening stream, creeping
            and leaping over rocks and decayed trunks of tree—splashing and foaming and gurgling with a faint and sickening
            sound. I stepped into the water to bathe my bleeding limbs
            —it was hot, boiling hot! a stifling steam rose to my face
            and almost suffocated me. I rushed back to my thorny road
            and toiled on. “Deeper and deeper still” the dingle grew,
            with rocks precipitous uprising close on either hand. At
            length they joined over my head, and all grew suddenly
            dark. The briars tore my feet more furiously than ever, and
            the reptiles glared their pestilent eyes at me with a most
            cruel familiarity. They squirmed their slimy folds around
            my legs, and crawling upon my shoulders, looked me in the
            face. Cold lizards brushed against my feet, and sent a chill
            through every fibre of my frame. The shrill whistling of
            
            unknown birds mingled with the howling of innumerable
            hideous beasts, echoed through the cavern like the voice of
            the thunder-storm when it is high. A piercing shriek of terrible distinctness burst upon my ear, and shook my heart
             within me. I stumbled with the shock and fell headlong
             into a pile of rattling bones. A thousand livid eyes flashed
            from within, and by their intense radiance, dazzled—blinded
            me. I crawled along the ground grasping the yielding serpents as they lay coiled beneath my hands, or slipped noiselessly away between my fingers. My frame seemed to expand, and an incomprehensible sense of largeness arose in
            me. I became a giant — a monster. I arose to my feet.
            The earth waved under me as I passed on. The roof of the
            cavern became lower, and I journeyed on till it was so low I
            could not stand erect. I stopped as I went, and felt the sidewalls closing in upon me. Every moment the passage became more straightened until I could no longer move. My
            neck was doubled and my head hung between my feet. My
             neck was twisted, and my face looked forward, but could
             not go on. I became like a statue, and my feet seemed
            rooted in the ground. A horrid thought of a perpetual doom
            like this, froze my blood, and my frame shuddered with ter rific convulsions. Suddenly, a stream of pure and silvery
            light poured in and diffused itself through the cavern, lighting up the unseen vault before me. On a pedestal of glow ing rock, a pale and wrinkled figure, of most frightful aspect,
            stood beckoning me onward. The radiance that spread it self around, was of so vague and indistinct a nature, that I
            could not distinguish the outline of the vision. It seemed
             like human, yet was most unearthly in its mould. One eye
             alone in living lustre shot forth from the centre of its head,
            and one from each its hands. And it swayed to and fro
             on its burning stand, and beckoned to me with its seeing
            hands; but the one eye in its head was fixed upon me motionless. Like the gleam of the lightning, it burned into my
            eyes and consumed my soul. In all my agony I had no
            thought of death nor of release; I only looked for suffering and pain, and wondered what new misery awaited me.
            Reaching forth one hand so that its glaring eye fell full upon
            my face, the figure stood, and with a voice like the howling
            of the night-wind among the graves, it spoke:
         </p>
         
         <p>“Mortal, beware!
            " Repine not at to-day, for to-morrow may be better!
            “Never ride in a two-wheeled cab, if you can walk, even with
            crutches!
            “With industry for your weapon, languor is easily defeated!
            “Never go to bed before sundown, nor without your supper!
            “A bath is belter for a bruise than sleep!
            “Never sleep with the moon shining on your bed!
            " Wear no gold buttons on the neck and wristbands of your shirt!
            " These things attend, and you may yet be happy!’’
         </p>
         
         <p>As it ceased speaking it leaned forward on its pedestal,
            and shook its glistening hands with fury in my face. With
            horror at its threatening attitude, I started hack, and instantly
            my feet released themselves from the ground, my body untwisted and resumed its natural shape, the figure vanished,
            the cave disappeared, and I fell----out of bed!
         </p>
         
         <p>It was a dream. The loss of my supper, and the bruises I
            received in my fall, had made me delirious. A grand exhibition of gymnastics, to time beat out of a gong at a neighboring “Hall,” made the awful noises; and the full moon
            shining through the open window on my shirt, (from which
            I had neglected to take the buttons) hanging upon the bedpost, and swayed by the wind, was the Ghost!

            <p>The Poetical Writings of Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith.
               First Complete Edition. New- York: J. S. Redfield.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith (better known as Mrs. Seba
               Smith) is indebted for her reputation as a poet, principally
               to “The Sinless Child,” her longest and perhaps her most
               meritorious composition. It was originally published in the
               “Southern Literary Messenger,” where it at once attracted
               much notice—but was not thoroughly appreciated until its
               second introduction to the public, in volume form, by Mr.
               John Keese, as editor. In a well-written Preface, he pointed
               out its peculiar merits, and these have since been readily and
               very generally admitted.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of course we do not agree with Mr. Keese in all the encomium which his personal partialities perhaps, rather than
               his judgment, have induced him to lavish on “The Sinless
               Child.” The conception is original, but somewhat forced;
               and although the execution is, in parts, effective, still the
               conduct, upon the whole, is feeble, and the denouement is obscure, and inconsequential. In any commendation of the
               poem, the critic should confine himself, principally, to detached passages. Many of these will be found to possess
               merit of a lofty order—and very many of them are remarkable for ease, grace, and exceeding delicacy and purity of
               thought and manner. For example:

            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Each tiny leaf became a scroll
               
               <br></br>Inscribed with holy truth,
               
               <br></br>A lesson that around the heart
               
               <br></br>Should keep the dew of youth:
               
               <br></br>Bright missals from angelic throngs
               
               <br></br>In every by-way left.
               
               <br></br>How were the earth of glory shorn,

            <p>We prefer, however, the little episode called “The Stepmother” to any portion of “The Sinless Child,” and shall
               take the liberty of quoting it in full. It has been universally and justly admired:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>You speak of Hobert’s second wife, a lofty dame and bold,
               
               <br></br>I like not her forbidding air and forehead high and cold.
               
               <br></br>The orphans have no cause for grief, she dare not give it now.
               
               <br></br>Though nothing but a ghostly fear, her heart of pride could bow.
               
               <br></br>One night the boy his mother called, they heard him weeping say,
               
               <br></br>“Sweet mother, kiss poor Eddy’s cheek, and wipe his tears away.”
               
               <br></br>Red grew the lady’s brow with rage, and yet she feels a strife
               
               <br></br>Of anger and of terror too, at thought of that dead wife.
               
               <br></br>Wild roars the wind, the lights burn blue, the watch-dog howls with
               fear,
               
               <br></br>Loud neighs the steed from out the stall: what form is gliding near?
               
               <br></br>No latch is raised, no step is heard, but a phantom fills the space—
               
               <br></br>A sheeted spectre from the dead, with cold and leaden face.
               
               <br></br>What boots it that no other eye beheld the shade appear!
               
               <br></br>The guilty lady’s guilty soul beheld it plain and clear,
               
               <br></br>It slowly glides within the room, and sadly looks around—
               
               <br></br>And stooping, kissed her daughter’s cheek with lips that gave no sound.
               
               <br></br>Then softly on the step-dame’s arm she laid a death-cold hand,
               
               <br></br>Yet it hath scorched within the flesh like to a burning brand.
               
               <br></br>And gliding on with noiseless foot, o’er winding stair and hall,
               
               <br></br>She nears the chamber where is heard her infant’s trembling call.
               
               <br></br>She smoothed the pillow where he lay, she warmly tucked the bed,
               
               <br></br>She wiped his tears, and stroked the curls that clustered round his head.
               
               <br></br>The child, caressed, unknowing fear, hath nestled him to rest;
               
               <br></br>The Mother folds her wings beside—the Mother from the Blest!

            <p>“The Acorn” has been often mentioned as the best of
               Mrs. Smith’s poems, and in many respects it is. It has more
               completeness than “The Sinless Child,” and excels it in
               vigor, as well as in the minor merit of versification. It by
               
               no means equals it, however, in fancy, or in the originality
               of its conception. The subject of “The Acorn” is not
               a novel one.
            </p>
            
            <p>Many of the Sonnets and shorter compositions, in the volume before us, are exceedingly beautiful. All are replete
               with that delicacy which is the distinguishing trait of the
               fair author. The two stanzas entitled “Presages” will exemplify this trait and Mrs. Smith’s general manner, perhaps,
               more strikingly than any thing we could cite of similar
               length.

            <p>The poem entitled “The Water” is singularly happy
               both in its conception and execution. We copy the two first
               stanzas, not only for their excellence, but by way of collating them with the opening lines of “Rain in Summer,” a
               poem, by Professor Longfellow, published in the August
               number of “Graham’s Magazine.”

               <br></br>Across the window-pane,
               
               <br></br>It pours and pours,
               
               <br></br>And swift and wide,
               
               <br></br>With a muddy tide,

            <p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of Choice Reading. No. XIX.
               Prose and Verse. By Thomas Hood. Part II.
            </p>
            
            <p>Week before last we had some general comments on Hood’s
               genius and peculiarities, and gave a detailed account of the
               contents of Part I. of his writings, as republished in the “Library of Choice Reading.” Of Part II. therefore, we have |
               little to say—except that it is fully as interesting as its predecessor. It embraces The Great Conflagration—A Tale of a
               Trumpet—Boz in America—Copyright and Copywrong—
               Prospectus to Hood’s Magazine—The Haunted House—Life
               in the Sick Room—An Autograph—Domestic Mesmerism—
               The Elm Tree—Lay of the Laborer—The Bridge of Sighs—
               The Lady’s Dream—and The Song of the Shirt.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of these the most remarkable are those which we have
               italicized. They convey, too, most distinctly the genius of
               the author—nor can any one thoughtfully read them without
               a conviction that hitherto that genius has been greatly misconceived—without perceiving that even the wit of Hood had
               its birth in a taint of melancholy—perhaps hereditary—and
               nearly amounting to monomania.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The Song of the Shirt” is such a composition as only
               Hood could have conceived, or written. Its popularity has
               been unbounded. Its effect arises from that grotesquerie
               which, in our previous article, we referred to the vivid Fancy of the author, impelled by hypochondriasis:—but “The
               Song of the Shirt” has scarcely a claim to the title of poem.
               This, however, is a mere question of words, and can by no
               means affect the high merit of the composition—to whatever
               appellation it may be considered entitled.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The Bridge of Sighs,” on the contrary, is a poem of the
               loftiest order, and in our opinion the finest written by Hood—
               being very far superior to “The Dream of Eugene Aram.”
               Not its least merit is the effective rush and whirl of its singular versification—so thoroughly in accordance with the
               wild insanity which is the thesis of the whole.

            </p>
            
            <p>We have so frequently spoken in the warmest terms of admiration, of the brilliant and versatile abilities of Mr. Willis, that there is really nothing left for us to say—upon the
               issue of this the third instalment of “The Loiterings.” Of
               its author the world has been willing to admit—what is a
               great deal to admit of any one, in these days of unoriginal
               mediocrity—that he has a marked way of his own, and in
               that way is altogether unrivalled. We look upon Mr. Willis as one of the truest men of letters in America. About
               him there is no particle of pretence. His works show his
               fine genius as it is. They convey the man. Whatever
               idea is gleaned of him through his bocks, will be confirmed
               upon personal acquaintance—and we know not one other
               roan of letters of whom the same thing can be confidently said.
               In general, of the talents, of the fancy, of the wit, of the:
               conversational powers, and especially of the accomplishments of a literary man, we get, through his compositions,
               a false, and very usually an exaggerated impression.

         <p>The New-York Art Reunion.—The title of this Society
            will probably be new to most of our readers; indeed, we
            ourselves, until a week or two since, were unconscious of its
            existence. It is quite a young Society, not having been established more than three months; but, judging from its
            success so far, we may safely, or at least hopefully, augur
            its ultimate prosperity. It is true that societies of this kind
            in other professions, as well as the Fine Arts, have been
            tried from time to time, and have failed; not from the want
            of intrinsic merit in themselves, but through some mismanagement, or some petty jealousy among the members. Let
            us hope, however, that such may not be the fate of the Art
            Reunion; but, on the contrary, that it may go on and flourish, and thus fulfil the useful ends in consideration of which
            it was established.
         </p>
         
         <p>We will afford our readers an insight into the objects of
            this Society. So far as we can learn, it originated with a
            number of young artists, assisted probably by Mr. Ridner
            and others, who felt strongly the want of an Association,
            where the members of the same profession could meet and
            converse upon Art, and all that relates to its prosperity and
            advancement—where the kindly feelings which should always exist between members of the same profession, should
            be allowed full scope, in the hope that friendly and familiar
            intercourse might foster and perfect them. This is a noble
            aim, and if it only be accomplished, the Art will have occasion to bless those who projected and carried it into effect.
         </p>
         
         <p>In order, however, to obtain a better understanding of the
            spirit of the Society, we will transcribe a few of the Articles
            of its Constitution.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article II. speaks clearly as to the object. “The object of this Association shall be to collect and combine information, by readings, essays, familiar conversations, by introduction of rare and curious specimens in the various departments of Art, and the employment of such other means
            as may hereafter be suggested, which may be calculated to
            promote and extend familiarity with, and knowledge of, the
            Art of Design.”
         </p>
         
         <p>By this, it will be perceived that besides familiar intercourse, the object includes readings and essays upon Art and
            its principles; the collection of rare and valuable artistic
            specimens, and the promotion of the knowledge of the Art
            of Design. We, however, doubt much the utility of one
            item in the 2d Article: we doubt if essays, written and delivered by young men to young men, will prove at all beneficial in their effect. In essays—or, more properly speaking,
            lectures—evidently intended for mutual instruction, facts,
            which are the result of a long practical experience, can alone
            be of any service to a young artist. The young wayfarer in
            every profession, having at length escaped from the bondage
            of tutelage, is ever prone to experimentalize—to start new
            theories, in order to overthrow old fashioned data. These
            visionary theories are of but little consequence, so long as
            they are confined to the keeping of one person, for experience will ere long develope their absurdity; but they might
            become most serious evils, if widely disseminated. Besides,
            
            even supposing the members would confine themselves to
            the illustrating of established and important facts, it is well
            known that all men are not gifted with the power of speaking or writing well, and consequently this item respecting
            essays may open the way to the emission of a considerable
            amount of absurdity and twaddle.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article 111. “The officers of this Association shall be a
            President, a Recording Secretary, who shall also act in the
            capacity of Treasurer, and a Secretary for Correspondence.
            These officers shall constitute an Executive Board, of which
            two members shall be a quorum.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We think that it would have been advisable to have had 
            two more officers, for when the number is so small, the opportunity of combining to control the Society is so much
            greater. It may, however, work belter than we anticipate.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article V. “It shall be the duty of the Recording Secretary to keep a record of the proceedings of each meeting; to
            record all important facts relating to the Arts, which may
            from time to time be elicited. * * *”
         </p>
         
         <p>This will form a journal of considerable interest in years
            to come, if the members and the Secretary do their duty.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article VI. “It shall be the duty of the Corresponding
            Secretary to establish, as far as practicable, a correspondence
            with foreign artists, for the purpose of eliciting knowledge
            of the condition of the Arts, and the doings of artists abroad,
            which shall be communicated at the next regular meeting
            after its receipt. He shall also carefully keep such corres-j
            pondence, and faithfully transmit the same to his successors, to be preserved as the property of the Association.”
         </p>
         
         <p>If such a correspondence can be opened and maintained,
            it will undoubtedly be the most interesting and instructive
            feature in the Association, and would form a history of the
            Arts of the present day, of great and lasting value.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article VII. “It shall be the duty of the Executive Board,
            at the expiration of every six months, to purchase out of the
            fund, some work of art, which shall have the approbation,
            by vote of two thirds of the members present, on the evening when the subject shall be presented for the consideration
            of the meeting, to be disposed of by lot, to the members of
            the Association.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We do not pretend to understand this sentence, for it is
            put together in the worst possible manner. The English of
            it is, we suppose, that after purchasing a specimen of art,
            with the approbation of a majority, it is to be awarded to
            some fortunate member, by lot. We cannot see the use of
            this. If the fund arising from the Society is to be appropriated to the purchase of works of art, why distribute them
            about? Why not let them remain the property of the society? There is nothing like a “property” for holding a society together.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article XI. “It shall be the duty of each member during
            each semi-annual term to present an original sketch, which
            shall be deposited with the Recording Secretary, to be disposed of by lot to the members at the expiration of each semiannual term. * *	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>We think this article open to the same objections urged
            against Art. 8.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article XII. “The President of this Association shall be
            elected once in every four weeks, the succession to proceed
            in alphabetical order.”
         </p>
         
         <p>This is, truly, an ultra-democratic arrangement, placing
            each man on a level with his neighbor. This system in the
            beginning is, we think, a wise one, for it will prevent the
            possibility of any jealousy arising among the members; but,
            if it is continued, although it will ensure an unanimous soci-,
            
            ety, it will certainly produced a weak one, if the President
            is to have any voice in the management. If however the
            two secretaries are to form the real government, they having six months to live may make a show of uniformity in
            the affairs, and the Presidents might be changed every week
            without injury to the society. We are in favor of letting the
            Society select the President, for we believe that the chances
            then would be in favor of superior talent.
         </p>
         
         <p>Article XV. “The first meeting in each month shall be
            devoted to the reception of visitors; and it shall be the privilege of each member to invite not exceeding three guests,
            male or female, for the evening.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We like this rule, for it will tend to spread a taste for the
            fine art, or will at least, cause many to think about them,
            who, otherwise would have remained indifferent to their very
            existence.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are other articles, but as they relate chiefly to the
            management of the Society, rules for the election of members, method of ballot, &amp;c., &amp;c., we have omitted them.
         </p>
         
         <p>We have been influenced in our remarks by a sincere wish
            to draw the public attention to this Association, and to the
            art for whose advancement it was established. What we
            have said, we have said in the most friendly spirit, and if
            our suggestions tend in any way to render the constitution
            more comprehensive we shall be more than repaid for our
            labor.

         <p>French Opera.—The French company repeated Meyerbeer’s celebrated Opera Robert le Diable, on Wednesday
            evening, 13th inst. During its first representations we were
            unable to noiice it, which we much regretted, as the importance of the work demanded every attention. We notice
            it, now, not only as a matter of duty but as a labor of love.
         </p>
         
         <p>The plot of the Opera is purely mystical, and is rendered
            still more mystical by a want of clearness in the working
            out. It is evidently designed after the plan of the ancient
            mysteries or moralities so much in vogue some three hundred years since. The author has evidently endeavoured to
            pourtray the two great antagonistic principles, Good and
            Evil, and to display their action, according to circumstances,
            in one human soul. As far as we can detect the author’s intention, we believe the following to be a correct account of
            the plot.
         </p>
         
         <p>Robert is supposed to have the------for his father, and
            his mother is the Duchess of Burgundy. Robert becomes
            the Duke, and is banished by his rebellious subjects. He
            volunteers in the wars then raging, and distinguishes himself by his indomitable courage. In one of the fierce encounters with the enemy his life is saved by Bertram, who is his
            father and the-------. Bertram so loves his son, that he
            prompts and urges him to every vice in this world, in order
            to gain the privilege of enjoying his society hereafter in-.
            Robert loves the Princess Isabella, and is loved by her in re-
            turn.
         </p>
         
         <p>The scene opens in the camp. Robert, with Bertram and
            others discovered drinking. A Palmer is brought in by the
            soldiers—he amuses the company by a song, in which he reI counts the iniquities of Robert, who immediately declares
            
            himself, and orders the Palmer to be hung. The poor man
            begs to see his betrothed, who accompanied him, and she
            is brought in. Robert recognizes her as Alice, his foster-sister, and saves her from the rude soldiery. She tells him his
            mother is dead, and when dying had begged her to seek
            him out, give him her will, and to hover near him. She
            then goes out. Bertram suggests a little play. Robert gambles with the others and loses all that he possesses, even to
            his sword and dagger. End of the first act.
         </p>
         
         <p>Robert has been estranged from the Princess, but through
            the medium of a letter, conveyed by Alice, they are reconciled. The Princess informs him that a grand tournament
            takes place that day, and that her father has decided to give
            her hand to the conqueror. The Prince of Grenada is to be
            his adversary. Robert determines to enter the lists; the
            Princess gives him a sword, and prays him to conquer for
            her sake. The lists are opened, the trumpet sounds, but
            Robert does not appear, and Isabella is to become the bride
            of the Prince. Bertram having lured Robert into a deep
            wood, detains him there by his spells. He then goes to the
            ruined nunnery to consult with demons. He is overheard by
            Alice, but he frightens her to secrecy. Robert enters, and
            Bertram, telling him of the fate of his love, suggests as a
            remedy that he should descend to the vaults below and pluck
            a branch from a tomb—only a sacrilege—which will give the
            power of invisibility, by which means he (Robert) will be
            enabled to enter the palace and ravish the bride from her
            home. Robert agrees, and having obtained the branch, is
            on the point of accomplishing his purpose, when his better
            angel saves him from this crime and he breaks the magic
            bough in twain, and delivers himself a prisoner. In the fifth
            act, Robert accuses Bertram of prompting him to every vice,
            and of causing all his misfortunes. Bertram defends himself— 
            but at that moment a solemn chant is heard—Robert’s better 
            feelings are awakened, and Bertram’s casuistry falls unheeded on his ear. Bertram fearing lest he should lose all power
            over Robert, acknowledges his relationship, and entreats him
            to fly with him. Robert is about to yield when Alice enters
            and gives him his mother’s will, in which she denounces
            Bertram as her betrayer. Alice also informs him that the
            Prince of Grenada on arriving at the church doors was taken
            with a shivering fit and fled, and that the Princess was wait- j
            ing for him (Robert) at the altar. Alice conquers, Bertram j
            vanishes, the scene changes to the interior of a church, and
            every body is happy.
         </p>
         
         <p>The principal characters were as follows:</p>
         
         <div class="ab">Robert, - - - M. Arnaud,
            
            <br></br>Bertram, - - - Douvry,
            
            <br></br>Raimbaut, - - - Buscher,
            
            <br></br>Alberti, - - - Garry,
            
            <br></br>The King, - - - Mathien,
            
            <br></br>Princess Isabella, - - - Madame Casini,
            
            <br></br>Alice, - - - Stephen Coeuriot
         </div>
         
         <p>Madame Casini was not equal to the music of the Princess Isabella. The part is a difficult one, and requires considerable physical strength to do due justice to it. We never
            yet allowed the magic influence of a beautiful voice to mislead our judgment with respect to style or taste, for though
            we are grateful to a fine organ for the pleasure we receive
            while listening to it, yet are we more thankful to the fine
            judgment which directs it: but still a powerful voice is truly
            important in such operas as Robert le Diable, and Les Huguenots. Without it all grandeur of effect is marred, and the
            passion which should rage like a tornado, becomes a puny
            whining: still we do not by any means intend to condemn 
            Madame Casini wholly; there were many points in her j
            singing truly excellent. Her execution in “Idol de ma vie” 
            was brilliant and true, and the whole of the last scene in
            
            the fourth act, during her interview with Robert, was given
            with much force and passion.
         </p>
         
         <p>Madame Stephen Cœuriot took the part of Alice. The
            deep grief caused by her recent severe loss, entirely destroyed
            her powers during the first act, but for the rest of the evening
            she had evidently fortified herself, and sang and acted most
            admirably. In two or three passages she drew down tumultuous applause by the spirit and force of her delivery.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Arnaud, as Robert, was very successful: his disagreeable method of substituting his head voice for his chest voice
            upon almost every note above E, was less perceptible than upon any other occasion, if we except his personation of Raoul
            in Les Huguenots. This method causes a very strange effect
            upon the audience—it appears as if the singer were holding
            a private conversation with, and singing into himself, for his
            own particular gratification. M. Arnaud’s best efforts were in
            the first and fourth acts.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Douvry, as Bertram, displayed his fine voice to great
             advantage. His part was a most arduous one, but he got
             through it with great spirit. The opening scene and the
             two duetts, one with Alice and the other with Robert, in the
             third act, were bis most spirited performances. M. Douvry
            has raised his reputation higher by his artistic conception
            and execution of Marcel and Bertram in Meyerbeer’s two
            operas, than by all his other efforts during the entire season.
         </p>
         
         <p>M. Garry did the little he had to do in his accustomed excellent manner.</p>
         
         <p>The choruses throughout were given with great spirit and
            effect.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Band deserves all that we can say in its praise; the
            music is of the extremest difficulty, but there was scarcely
            a hitch from the beginning to the end.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the music we have much to say, though we have but
            little space to say it in. Meyerbeer undoubtedly possesses
            great genius, but it is not of the highest order. His imagination is vivid, brilliant, and deeply tinctured by romance;
            his emotions are evidently profound and earnest, for the passion of his music is evidently the passion of Nature—the result of a highly wrought and enthusiastic appreciation of all
            that is beautiful or worthy in our common nature. His
            knowledge of the resources of the orchestra is profound, and
            his method of applying his knowledge is bold and comprehensive. He is less careful than the great masters, with the
            exception of Beethoven, for they, treating the orchestra as a
            whole, ensure the developments of their efforts, even by a
            common orchestra; but Meyerbeer treats the orchestra most
            frequently as an assemblage of solo instruments, and thus
            brings his instrumentation only within the range of first rate
            players. We do not cavil at this, for he treats his score with
            wonderful power; his effects are frequently marvellous,
            bursting upon the ear in a gigantic mass of richly swelling
            harmony, while his peculiar method adds a lightness and
            varied beauty to the ensemble, which must be heard to be
            truly appreciated. The double-bass and the violoncello appear to be especial favorites with Meyerbeer, and he uses
            them with a freedom, such as no other composer except
            Beethoven ever attempted.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the two operas, Robert le Diable and Les Huguenots,
            we are inclined to prefer the Huguenots. Robert is the more
            imaginative of the two, but the Huguenots we believe to be
            more sterling. Nothing can exceed the masterly effects produced by the introduction, in various places, of the Huguenot
            Chorale; it is a thought only within the scope of a master
            mind. Another great beauty, to our mind, is the admirable
            fidelity of the music to the date of the action of the piece.
            
            To all who are acquainted with the old French style, this
            will at once be perceptible, and cannot fail to strike them as
            a certain proof of the genius of the writer. Too much praise
            cannot be awarded to him for preserving the quaint, angular, and too frequently disagreeable, progressions of this
            style, and yet so treating them as to render them not only
            pleasing, but positive beauties. Truth is all powerful in
            every thing, and music cannot be omitted from the rest.
            The mere succession of pleasing sounds is nothing, however
            beautiful, when the design bears a false relation to the situation—while mere common-place rises almost to grandeur,
            when it has for its basis, truth.
         </p>
         
         <p>To point out all the beauties of these Operas, would occupy more space than we at present can afford. “Robert”
            abounds in beauties, but we think that the whole force of the
            work is centered in the scene in the Fifth Act, between
            Robert, Bertram, and Alice. This comprises a series of
            movements of extraordinary beauty, which are worked with
            a power, and produce an effect, altogether surprising. Of
            the music of the Huguenots, we prefer that which is contained in the First and Fourth Acts. If the whole of the
            music of the two works was equal to the Fourth Act of the
            Huguenots, Meyerbeer would rank with any Composer living
            or dead; but the inequality of his music denies to him that
            honor.
         </p>
         
         <p>We would gladly extend our notice of this extraordinary
            man, but we are compelled to desist. We subjoin, however, a sketch of his life, which we are sure will be agreeable
            to our readers.
         </p>
         
         <p>This celebrated composer was born at Berlin, the 5th September,
            1791. His father, John Beer, a rich landholder, had several children,
            one of whom afterwards became a dramatic poet of much merit, and
            the author of a celebrated tragedy, entitled "The Pariah.” His brother, Jacques Meyerbeer, also gave early indications of that dramatic
            genius, which, united with his musical talent, has made him one of the
            most effective composers of the day. He enjoyed through his father’s
            affection and foresight, the advantages of an extensive and liberal education, and soon became remarkable above all for his musical taste.
            At seven years of age he already performed on the piano at public con-.
            certs; but it was not till he had reached the age of fifteen that he commenced his deeper and more scientific musical studies. He was fortunate in his choice of a master. The Abbe Vogler, who was one of the
            greatest theorists, and certainly the first organist in Germany, had
            opened a school, which was numerously attended, and amongst the
            fellow pupils of Meyerbeer were young men whose names are now
            never spoken of but with the deepest admiration; such as Weber, Winter, Knecht, Ritter, Oapnsbacher, &amp;c., and the first of these was Meyerbeer’s bosom friend. With such worthy subjects for emulation, it
            is not wonderful that the young musician’s genius daily expanded.
            At eighteen years of age he produced his first opera, “La Fille de
            Jephte.” In this production all the ancient scholastic rules were
            strictly observed. It obtained a fair portion of success, and the Abbe
            Volger, in his enthusiasm, signed his brevet of a maestro for the young
            composer, adding his blessing, and giving up his tutelage.
         </p>
         
         <p>At Vienna, Meyerbeer appeared as a pianist; he acquired, however,
            such a reputation, that he was entrusted with the composition of an
            opera for the Court, entitled “The Two Caliphs.” This, however,
            was a complete failure. Italian music was, at that period, in the highest vogue, and Salieri, the author, a great friend of young Meyerbeer,
            advised his travelling in Italy, to acquire a style of composition more
            in unison with the prevailing taste. Once arrived there, the Italian
            music fascinated his imagination. Delighted with the sweet and
            flowing melodies and varied manner of Rossini’s “Tancredi,” he immediately adopted this style, and wrote an opera for the famous Pisaroni, entitled, “Romilda e Costanza,” which he brought out in Padna.
            1817, and which was very successful. In 1819, be wrote the music for
            Metastasio’s “Semiramide Riconoscinta,” and brought it out at the
            Grand Theatre of Turin; the same year, at Venice, he produced
            " Emma di Rcsburgo and both were extremely well received. In
            1821, Meyerbeer, not unmindful of bis native city, and anxious to redeem his fame wrote in the Italian style “La Parte de Brandebourg,” to be performed at Berlin, but he could not succeed in getting
            it produced there. He was more fortunate in his “Emma di Resburgo:" it was translated, and performed at all the German theatres, in
            spite of the violent opposition of that school of composers to which he
            had a short time before belonged. Even Weber deplored the
            change of style of his friend, and while "Emma” was performed
            at the Italian Opera-house brought forth again “The Two Caliphs”
            at the German Theatre, hoping to throw the balance in favor of Meyerbeer’s earliest production. Meanwhile our composer produced another opera—“Margherita d’Anjou”—at the Scala at Milan; and in
            this, Devasseur, now a distinguished artist of the Grand Opera at Paris, made his debut. “L’Esule di Granata” followed—the first act was
            hissed on the first performance, by a cabal formed against the composor; a fine duet between Lablache and Pisaroni, however, carried the
            audience by storm, and on the subsequent nights its success was undoubted. One of Meyerbeer’s best compositions, “II Crociata Crivelli,” obtained more brilliant success than any of his preceding works,
            and the composer was crowned by the audience. This opera, after
            making the tour of the Italian theatres was performed at Paris,
            whither Meyerbeer himself, at the invitation of M. De la Rochefoucault, repaired. Every one remembers the effect that Velluti produced in this opera.
         </p>
         
         <p>Our composer married in l828, but the death of his two children
            threw a gloom over this part of his life; he passed two years in retirement, and it was, doubtless, during this time that he brought forth
            those compositions in a more serious cast, which have so highly distinguished him as a composer of sacred music. Amongst them we
            may remark the “Stabat Mater,” “Miserere,” “Te Deum,” and an
            oratorio, entitled, “Dieu et la Nature.” But the effect of all these
            compositions were only the shadowing forth of the brilliant success of
            “Robert le Diable,” brought out in Paris in 1831. This splendid music did more towards raising the reputation of our composer than all
            his previous works. Admirably adapted for popularity by its stirring
            melodies, and, above all, its strongly marked constrasts and dramatic
            effects, it seized immediate hold of the imagination. Repetition and
            study were not needed to advance its claims, for it addressed itself to
            the sight, to the fancy, and the heart, as much a s to the ear, and
            hough a marvel of science and labor, it had every quality for attracting the vulgar mind.
         </p>
         
         <p>The composition of the “Huguenots,” brought out five years later,
            must have been a work of considerable difficulty, for an enormous reputation was to be sustained in a production of the same calibre and
            pretensions. The success of the “Huguenots” did not, perhaps, equal
            that of “Robert le Diable,” but it was felt and understood as a work
            of genius.
         </p>
         
         <p>Certainly the best operas of Meyerbeer are those he had written for
            the French stage. In his native country he has been unfortunate:
            having returned there after a great lapse of years, his most ambitious
            production, since his stay there, has been the “Camp of Silesia,” of
            which so many different opinions have been given. But it is beyond
            a doubt that this opera is inferior in genius to the great productions
            we have mentioned; and this is testified by the unfrequency of its performance at Berlin; the reason given by the King of Prussia—that of
            wishing to reserve it for state occasions alone—appearing to be merely as a feint to conceal the comparative failure of a composer so highly esteemed.
         </p>
         
         <p>Meyerbeer, though enormously rich, lives in a most unpretending
            style, and is not very partial to society. He carries his love for his
            art to an extraordinary degree. In other things, he is quiet and simple in his manners, but possesses a fund of good sense and general information. He is small of stature, his hair is black, and his face bears
            the type of his Hebrew origin.
         </p>
         
         <p>Much of the peculiarity of this composer’s productions may be explained by referring to the history of his life, his early studies, and
            predictions. In his works may be traced the deep science and thorough musical knowledge which he acquired in the outset of his career
            —the sentimental sweetness of the Italian school, and the profusion
            of embroidery, the employment of dramatic effects, characteristic of
            the musical taste of the French nation, amongst whom he produced
            his later compositions.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the head of his style of musical art, he may bo said to have
            founded the school to which he belongs. But greatly as the productions of this composer must be admired, his followers, not possessing
            his genius, will, it is to be feared, rather injure than forward the advancement of pure and musical taste. The peculiarities of his style,
            indeed, are suc       will be readily resorted to for reasons far differen
            
            to those by which he was actuated; for in finding the possibility of
            substituting noise for melody, and startling contrast and effect for truly scientific combinations, many a composer who would otherwise have
            lived unsung, may be induced to offer his meagre and trashy productions to the world.
         </p>
         
         <p>Death of M. Artot.—All our readers will doubtless remember Artot, the violinist, who came to this country with
            Madame Cinti Damoreau. He was greatly admired here,
            and throughout the country; indeed, a very large class preferred his playing to that of either Vieuxtemps or of Ole
            Bull. Artot was a pupil of the Conservatoire, and was distinguished in his style for the exquisite and speaking pathos
            of his Adagios, and the general purity of his Method. Compared with Vieuxtemps, Artot would have ranked as second
            rate; for, despite the excellences of his performance, he
            wanted that classical severity of school, for which Vieuxtemps is so universally distinguished. Artot’s expression
            would sometimes partake of extreme exaggeration, and he
            would often indulge in an affectation of sentiment, which,
            however successfully it may, for once, pass for the true thing,
            cannot be mistaken a second time.
         </p>
         
         <p>Artot was born in Brussels, in 1815, and died at Ville
            D’ Arvray, near Paris, on the 20th inst., of consumption, at
            the early age of thirty.
         </p>
         
         <p>Death of J. A. Wade.—It is with much regret that we
            announce the death of Joseph Augustine Wade. Most of
            our musical readers will remember his name in connection
            with the popular songs, “Meet me by moonlight alone,” and
            “Love was once a little boy,” each of which went through
            twenty or thirty editions. The sale of “Meet me by moonlight alone,’’ extended to over two hundred thousand copies,
            and netted to the publisher some ten thousand pounds sterling. We believe that Mr. Wade was the author of the
            words and music of over a thousand songs and ballads. He
            was a man of fine talents; as a linguist he was much distinguished, and his familiarity with the Classics was extensive. All who have been in the habit of reading the English Magazines for many years past, will remember Mr. Wade
            as a poet, for his beautiful thoughts adorned the pages of
            most of them, from month to month. He published a series
            of papers in one of them, entitled the “Songs of the Flowers,” which were universally praised for the beautiful imagery they contained, for their poetical conception, and artist-like
            execution. He afterwards set the “Songs of the Flowers”
            to music. They were published in one book, containing
            Songs, Duets, Quartettes, &amp;c., and were admirably adapted
            for performance in private circles. The pieces are now, we
            believe, published separately . As a Composer of Music, Mr.
            Wade rarely or never soared above the pretty or the sweet.
            What he did, however, gave constant evidence of much
            musical knowledge and musician-like feeling. His style was
            generally passionate and melancholy, and rarely brilliant or
            forcible.
         </p>
         
         <p>In conversation, Mr. Wade was truly entertaining. Possessed of much general knowledge, abounding with anecdote—blessed with a retentive memory, and gifted, to an ex- 
            traordinary degree, with the power of bringing into strong 
            relief the humorous points of a story—he was rarely at a 
            loss, in whatever society he was thrown. His mind was 
            stored with the legendary lore of Ireland. Not a spot in
            the land but he could furnish some legend of—and when
            upon this topic, his language became glowing and eloquent,
            and would compel a company to listen untired for hours.—
            Of his faults and his follies, we will not speak; suffice it to
            say, that the worst enemy he had, was himself.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>By his death, the world has lost a gifted son—but poor
            Wade lost little, for he had little to lose. For many years
            his life had been but one constant struggle against adversity.
            Independence was ever within his reach, but with a recklessness, which was the most striking characteristic of his
            mind, he forgot to-morrow in the enjoymennt of to-day. He
            cast away the substance, and grasped the shadow, which
            has been to him as the Shadow of the Valley of Death.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oratorio of the Seven Sleepers.—We call the attention
            of our readers to the advertisement of this work in another
            column. We know the music: it is beautiful, and the performance will, we are sure, surpass any vocal exhibition ever
            presented to the public in this country. The peculiar arrangement respecting the sale of the tickets, should attract
            particular attention. We shall notice it more fully in our
            next.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Derwort’s Singing Class for Young Ladies.—We
            know no one more calculated to instruct the youthful successfully, than Mr. Derwort. His is patient, persevering, and
            gentle, though sufficiently severe, and, withal, brings an experience of very many years to aid in his undertaking. He
            has explained to us his system, and we have no hesitation in
            recommending all those who wish their young daughters to
            acquire a thoroughly good musical education, to enroll their
            names on Mr. Derwort’s class list.

         <p>The tomb of Carl Maria Von Weber, at Dresden, being
            completed, the Musical Society of Hamburg has sent a
            massive crown of silver, admirably wrought, to adorn the
            marble bust of the lamented composer of Oberon and the
            Fryeschutz, which is to be placed above the tomb.
         </p>
         
         <p>A letter from Munich, dated the 5th of July, contains the
            following paragraph:
         </p>
         
         <p>“This morning at nine o’clock, the composer R-, of Berlin,publicly in the open court, made an humble apology before the king’s picture. He had been condemned to this punishment, and a year’s imprisonment, for having spoken disrespectfully of his majesty.”</p>
         
         <p>This will surely prove a practical demonstration of the
            wisdom of the old proverb—“Keep your tongue within your
            teeth."
         </p>
         
         <p>Donizetti has arrived in Paris, from Vienna, where we believe he holds the situation of Capel Meister to the Emperor.</p>
         
         <p>Three great festivals at present excite the interest of the
            world of musical amateurs and professors. The one which
            will undoubtedly prove the most interesting, takes place at
            Bohn, on the Rhine, early in this month, for the inauguration of the monument erected to Beethoven, who was born
            in that town. It will continue for four days, and will be conducted by Liszt. Sir George Smart and other professors,
            have been invited to attend.
         </p>
         
         <p>The festival of the union of the three choirs at Worcester,
            takes place the second week in August, and the Norwich
            festival is fixed to take place the second week in September.
         </p>
         
         <p>Grisi, Mario, the two Lablaches, and Benedict (composer
            of the Gipsy’s Warning, and also an admirable pianist) are
            engaged for several subscription concerts to be given at Liverpool.
         </p>
         
         <p>A third party is forming for the purpose of giving concerts
            
            
            in the provinces, consisting of Madame Castellan, Mdlle.
            Rosetti, Fornasari, &amp;c., &amp;c. The other two are the Grisi
            and the Brambilla parties.

         <p>Miss Birch has arrived at Milan, and has, ere this, begun
            to rehearse the opera in which she is to make her debut at
            La Scala.
         </p>
         
         <p>Sivori, the eminent and youthful violinist, is now in France,
            where he is engaged to perform at various concerts, which
            are to take place at Boulogne, Dunkirk, &amp;c., &amp;c.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Brussels Company are still at Drury Lane. Report
            does not speak very highly of them.
         </p>
         
         <p>Vauxhall Gardens, for many, many years the favorite resort of pleasure-seeking Londoners, were put up to auction.
            The first offer for the principal lot, including the public gardens, Rotunda, &amp;c., &amp;c., was ten thousand pounds. After
            much competition it was knocked down at seventeen thousand seven hundred pounds, but at which price the auctioneer said it was not sold.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Braham and his sons were at Cheltenham. The concerts were but poorly attended.</p>
         
         <p>It is said that an Opera by Mr. Edward Loder, to be called Griselle, will be performed at the Princess’ Theatre, Oxford street. Mrs. Smithson, the successful debutante, will
            be the heroine.

         <p>Mr. Lumley, formerly Lessee, has become the proprietor
            of the Italian Opera House, and the principal proprietor of

         <div class="head">Editorial Miscellany.</div>
         
         <p>A late number of “The New York Mirror” contains a
            very fulsome “Resume" of “The Challenge of Barletta.”
            This Resume [what is a resume?] is written very much in
            the manner of Mr. Lester, whom it compliments with great
            warmth, and no doubt (in Mr. Lester’s opinion) with great
            justice. We are quite astonished, however, to find so respectable a journal as “The Mirror” degrading itself to the
            admission of obvious puffs from the pens of “correspondents.”
            The article in question has the following passage:
         </p>
         
         <p>“It must be read from beginning to end, and we do not believe any
            man can read the first chapter without reading on and reading it
            through. A certain critic has complained that the book lacks “autorial commaut;" rather a muddy idea—ne'est pas, dear General?
            He says it is “all incident;" and what else in the name of Waller
            Scott would you have in a historical romance? This is just what a historical romance is written for, says McCauley.”
         </p>
         
         <p>We are the “certain critic” here alluded to. The phrase
            “autorial commaut” as quoted by Mr. Lester’s friend or self,
            is a falsehood—one of his 50,000. We defy him to show
            us in our critique anything resembling what he unblushingly
            attributes to us. The “muddy idea” is then only his own
            —and we never knew him to have one that was not. But
            will he be so good as to translate for the readers of “The
            Mirror” the phrase ne'est pas—and at the same time inform
            us who u the Mr. McCauley to whom he attributes so much
            rigmarole about historical romance?
         </p>
         
         <p>As regards the impossibility of not reading Mr. Lester’s
            stupid book through, the only impossibility in our case, and
            tu all that we have heard of, has been to refrain from throwtug the thing out of the window after being sickened to death
            by the Preface.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>During a recent visit to Boston, we were agreeably surprised at the number of intrinsically valuable works on the
            counters of “the trade.” Why is it that so few of them are
            generally circulated in New York? A more liberal interchange of literary commodities would certainly prove beneficial to the two communities. We know not how it is, but
            few of the writers of New England exercise much influ enee
            beyond her borders; and, on the other hand, in conversing
            with men of letters in that region, we have marvelled at their
            ignorance of Knickerbocker authors. The evil would in part
            be remedied, if New York were regarded as it should be, as
            the London of America—and if all literary enterprises were
            here carried into effect. The facilities for distributing works,
            are far greater than any other of our cities can boast—and as a
            centre of opinion, it is the metropolis of the country.
         </p>
         
         <p>Among other booksellers in Boston, whose publications
            deserve to be better known here, are James Munroe &amp; Co.
            The inimitable “Twice Told Tales” of Hawthorne, were
            published by this house. Their circulation, however, has
            home no proportion to their merit. Hawthorne, it appears
            to us, has fulfilled all the conditions which should insure success, and yet he has reaped but a scanty harvest. He is a
            prose poet, lull of originality, beauty and refinement of style
            and conception, while many of his subjects are thoroughly
            American. He is frugal and industrious, but the profit of his
            writings are inadequate to his support. We trust he will embark his next work in this market and predict that it will be
            more lucrative.
         </p>
         
         <p>Another beautiful work on Munroe’s counter is “Flower
            and Thom Pieces,” translated from Jean Paul. Exquisite
            metaphors and wise suggestions on life abound in these
            pages. They have apparently escaped the notice of our critics, but richly deserve their attention. The school-books
            issued from the Boston press are eminently worthy the adoption of the friends of education in this State. Two in particular of Munroe &amp; Co’s. attracted our regard—the one an admirably selected Reader for young ladies, edited by William
            Russell, an experienced teacher and man of distinguished
            taste;—the other a little volume of devotional exercises for
            schools, compiled by Mr. Buckingham, the able editor of the
            Boston Courier. There is no sectarianism, and great felicity
            of arrangement in this volume. We may resume the subject of Boston books. Meantime we observe with pleasure
            that Ticknor &amp; Co. have in press new editions of Keat’s
            Poems and Lamb’s Dramatic Specimens, and that B. B.
            Murray is about to re-publish Festus, by Bailey.

         <p>Signor Vincenzo Devit, a distinguished professor of the college of Padua, has, it is said, made a discovery of great interest, in the field of classical literature. In an ancient manuscript in the library of that establishment, he has found a
            set of unpublished maxims by Varro, the illustrious contemporary of Caesar and Augustus, and friend and client of Cicero.—We may mention, too, on the faith of a letter from St.
            Petersburg, that Dr. Passelt, Professor of History at the University of Dorpat, being in the capital, has discovered, among
            the archives of the empire, eleven aurograph letters from Leb uitz to Peter the First. They are written some in Latin, and
            
            
            some in German,—are all relating to matters of science,—
            and seem to indicate the existence of a continuous correspondence between the illustrious philosopher and the great
            Czar. They are about to be published.

         <p>We notice with regret the death of James Augustus
            Shea, Esq., a native of Ireland, for many years a citizen of
            the United States, and a resident of this city. He died on
            Friday morning, the 17th inst., at the early age of 42. A
            large concourse of friends and relatives attended his funeral.
            As an ardent republican Mr. Shea did much for the cause of
            freedom. As a poet, his reputation was high — but by no
            means so high as his deserts. His “Ocean” is really one
            of the most spirited lyrics ever published. Its rhythm strikingly resembles “The Bridge of Sighs.”

            high reputation in the West. We have to thank him for an
            original poem, which we shall publish in our next. His book
            will be issued by Messrs. Robinson &amp; Jones, of Cincinnati.

         <p>Dr. James M’Henry, who resided several years in Philadelphia, and was known as the author of “O’Halloran,” the 
            “Antediluvians,” Ac., died at Larne, in Ireland, on the 21st
            ult., in the 59th year of his age. Dr. M’H. was appointed
            United States Consul to Londonderry, by Mr. Tyler, in 1843. 
            As a poet and author in general, Dr. M’Henry was underrated. He fell a victim to the arts of a clique which proceeded, in the most systematic manner, to write him down—
            not scrupling, either, to avow the detestable purpose. Some of
            the very best criticisms in Mr. Walsh’s “American Quarterly
            Review,” were the work of Dr. M’H. His “Antediluvians"
            
            was heavy, and certainly gave no indication of genius—but
            it is by no means the despicable trash which it has been represented. It is polished, well versified, and abounding in
            noble sentiments. Altogether, it is the best epic which the
            country has produced. Some of his songs are highly meritorious.

         <p>Letters from Naples mention some recent discoveries of
            interest made in late excavations at Pompeii, particularly an
            extensive Necropolis. Beside one of the graves there is a
            seat, and over it is inscribed Clovatius, Duumvir of Pompeii. This is a family name hitherto unknown. Near it is
            a monument of fine Grecian marble, richly sculptured. The
            ground where these discoveries have been made is the property of Signor Vellucci, who pays so little regard to antiquities, that as soon as he hears of a grave being explored, he
            orders it to be filled up with earth or rubbish.

            the observations differed more than three seconds from this
            mean. The latitude of the same place as deduced from Mr.
            Paine's observations of that of the Unitarian Church in Old

            Germany, but relinquished on account of the difference of
            size. M. Dubois has succeeded triumphantly, and has furnished drawings for a font of 1500 characters, 800 of which
            are already cast.

            whose talents are well known both as a composer and pianist, has been appointed by the committee umpire of the musical compositions and performances.

            them how they may get rid of one of the annoyances that
            check the free current of their thoughts when they would indite them for the benefit of others, or—their own gratification.

               when the British Government had withdrawn most of the troops, to
               prosecute the American War, the people formed themselves into
               Volunteer Companies, and showed a force so formidable, that France
               abandoned the attempt. The companies, at one time, are supposed to
               have amounted to one hundred thousand men, well armed and disciplined, but having no foreign enemy to contend with, this immense
               force united to effect the political regeneration of their country.

               Giles’s for her lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg’s golden childhood—
               there was hardly a verse in which some touches of heart, or some play

               will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassiouate.”—Literary Gazette.

            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
               yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
               The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
               enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
               through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too oftcu
               made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
               a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
               only by the study of such methods ns Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
               bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
               musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
               rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
               each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
               from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
               Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
               of them hiving used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
               necessary to give a few of the names in the principal cities.
