               <br/>I know a noble heart that beats
<br/>For one it loves how “ wildly well!”
<br/>I only know for whom it beats ;
<br/>But I must never tell!
<br/>Never tell!
<br/>Hush! hark ! how Echo soft repeats,—
<br/>Ah! never tell!
<br/>I know a voice that falters low,
<br/>Whene’er one little name ’t would say ;
<br/>Full well that little name I know,
<br/>But that I’ll ne’er betray!
<br/>Ne’er betray!
<br/>Hush! hark! how Echo murmurs low,—
<br/>Ah! ne’er betray!
<br/>I know a smile that beaming flies
<br/>From soul to lip, with rapturous glow,
<br/>And I can guess who bids it rise;
<br/>But none—but none shall know!
<br/>None shall know!
<br/>Hush! hark! how Echo faintly sighs—

                <p>It’s on my wisiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s
<br/>all o’ pink satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may
<br/>behould the intheristhin words, “ Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
<br/>Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell Square, Parrish o’
<br/>Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin to diskiver who is
<br/>the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun
<br/>in the houl city o' Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf. And fait that
<br/>same is no wonder at all at all, (so be plased to stop curlin
<br/>your nose,) for every inch o’ the six wakes that I’ve been a
<br/>gintleman, and left aff wid the bog-throthing to take up wid
<br/>the Barronissy, i’ts Pathrick that’s been living like a houly
<br/>imperor, and gifting the iddication and the graces. Och !
<br/>and would'nt it be a blessed thing for your sperrits if ye cud
<br/>lay your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
<br/>Barronitt, when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or
<br/>“Upping into the Brisky for the drive into the Hyde Park.—
<br/>But it's the iligant big figgur that I ave, for the rason o’
<br/>which all the ladies fall in love wid me. Isn’t it my own
<br/>swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inch-
<br/>es more nor that, in me stockings, and that am excadingly
<br/>will proportioned all over to match ? And is it ralelly more
<br/>than the three fut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the
<br/>little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,
<br/>and that’s a oggling and a goggling the houl day, (and bad
<br/>luck to him,) at the purty widdy Misthress Trade that’s my
<br/>own nixt door neighbor, (God bliss her) and a most parlicul-
<br/>ler frind and acquintance? You percave the little spal-<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>peen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand
<br/>in a sling; and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m
<br/>going to give you the good rason.</p>
                  <p>The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough ; for
<br/>the very first day that I com’d from Connaught, and showd
<br/>my swate little silf in the strait to the widdy, who was look-
<br/>ing through the windy, it was a gone case althegither wid
<br/>the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it, ye
<br/>see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s thruth.
<br/>First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she
<br/>threw open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a
<br/>little gould spy-glass that she dapped tight to one o’ them,
<br/>and divil may burn me if it did’nt spake to me as plain as
<br/>a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass,
<br/>“ Och ! the tip o’ the mornin to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandi-
<br/>son, Barronitt, mavourneen; aud it’s a nate gintleman that
<br/>ye are, sure enough, and it’s mesilf and me fortin jist that’ll
<br/>be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’ day at all at all for the
<br/>asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the
<br/>purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha broken yur
<br/>heart althegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat
<br/>with a flourish, and thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes,
<br/>as much as to say, “ Thrue for you, yer a swate little cra-
<br/>ture, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be
<br/>drownthed dead in a bog, if its not mesilf, Sir Pathrick
<br/>O’Grandison, Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to
<br/>yur leddy-ship, in the twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry
<br/>purraty.”</p>
                  <p>And it was the nixt mornin, sure, jist as I was making
<br/>up me mind whither it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to
<br/>sind a bit o’ writin to the widdy by way of a love-litter,
<br/>when up cum’d the delivery sarvant wid an illigant card,
<br/>and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver cud rade
<br/>the copper-plate printin on account of being lift handed) was
<br/>all about Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Mai-
<br/>ter-di-dauns, and that the houl of the divilish lingo was the
<br/>spalpeeny long name of the little ould furrener Frinchman
<br/>as lived over the way.</p>
                  <p>And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himsilf, and
<br/>thin he made me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had
<br/>ounly taken the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving
<br/>me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a great rate, and
<br/>divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the
<br/>tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said
<br/>“ pully wou, woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’
<br/>lies, bad luck to him, that he was mad for the love o’ my
<br/>widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy Mrs. Tracle had
<br/>a puncheon for him.</p>
                  <p>At the hearin of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad
<br/>as a grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick
<br/>O’Grandison, Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal
<br/>to lit the anger git the upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I
<br/>made light o’ the matter and kipt dark, and got quite socia-
<br/>ble wid the little chap, and afther a while what did he do<br/>
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page130"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud
<br/>give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.</p>
                  <p>“ Is it there ye are ?” said I thin to mesilf, “ and its thrue
<br/>for you. Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunnittest mortal in life.
<br/>We’ll soon see now whither its your swate silf, or whither
<br/>its little Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is
<br/>head and ears in the love wid.’’</p>
                  <p>Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye
<br/>may well say it was an illigant place; so it was. There
<br/>was a carpet all over the floor, and in one corner there was
<br/>a forty-pinny and a jews-harp and the divil knows whatilse,
<br/>and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in
<br/>all natur, aud sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the
<br/>swate little angel, Misthress Tracle.</p>
                  <p>“ The tip o’ the morning to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Trade,”
<br/>and thin I made sich an iligant obaysance that it wud ha
<br/>quite althegither bewildered the brain o’ ye.</p>
                  <p>“ Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the
<br/>little furrenner Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says
<br/>he, that he did, “isn’t this gintleman here jist his riverence
<br/>Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and isn’t he althegither
<br/>and entirely the most purticular frind and acquintance that
<br/>I have in the houl world ?”</p>
                  <p>And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and
<br/>makes the swatest curtchy nor iver was seen ; and thin down
<br/>she sits like an angel; and thin, by the powers, it was that
<br/>little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns that plumped
<br/>his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon ! I
<br/>ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head
<br/>on the spot, I was so dispirate mad ! Howiver, “ Bait
<br/>who!” says I, after a while. “ Is it there ye are, Mounseer
<br/>Maiter-di-dauns ?” and so down I plumped on the lift side
<br/>of her leddyship, to be aven wid the willain. Botheration!
<br/>it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant double
<br/>wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face wid both
<br/>eyes.</p>
                  <p>But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict
<br/>me at all at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love
<br/>to her leddyship. “Woully wou” says he, “Pully wou”
<br/>says he, “ Plump in the mud" says he.</p>
                  <p>“ That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,”
<br/>thinks I; and I talked as hard and as fast as I could all the
<br/>while, and throth it was mesilf jist that divarted her leddy-
<br/>ship complately and intirely, by rason of the illigant con-
<br/>versation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of
<br/>Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate
<br/>smile, from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made
<br/>me as bould as a pig, and I jist took hould of the ind of her
<br/>little finger in the most dillikittest manner in natur, look-
<br/>ing at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.</p>
                  <p>And then ounly to percave the cuteness of the swate an-
<br/>gel, for no sooner did she obsarve that I was afther the
<br/>squazing of her flipper, than she up wid it in a jitfy, and put
<br/>it away behind her back, jist as much as to say, “ Now thin,
<br/>Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,
<br/>mavourneen, for its not altogether the gentaal thing to be
<br/>afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of
<br/>that little furrenner Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”</p>
                  <p>Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “ lit Sir Path-
<br/>rick alone for the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint
<br/>aisy to work, and you'd have died wid the divarsion to be-
<br/>hould how oliverly I slipped my right arm betwane the back
<br/>o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there, sure
<br/>enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say,
<br/>“ the tip o’ the mornin to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Bar-<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>ronitt.” And wasn’t it mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste
<br/>little bit of a squaze in the world, all in the way of a com-
<br/>mincement, and not to be too rough wid her leddyship? and
<br/>och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest of all
<br/>the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thun-
<br/>der, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen” thinks I to mesilf, “ fait it’s
<br/>jist the mother’s son of you, and nobody else at all at all,
<br/>that’s the handsomest and the fortunittest young bogthrotter
<br/>that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And wid that I giv’d
<br/>the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the
<br/>powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would
<br/>ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin to behould,
<br/>jist thin all at once, the concated behaviour of Mounseer
<br/>Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a jabbering, and a smirk-
<br/>ing, and a parly-wouing as he begin’d wid her leddyship,
<br/>niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me
<br/>if it wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tip-
<br/>ping her the wink out of one eye. Och hon ! if it wasn’t
<br/>mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be
<br/>tould who it was!</p>
                  <p>“ Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I,
<br/>as purlite as iver ye seed, “ that it’s not the gintaal thing at
<br/>ail at all, and not for the likes o’ you inny how, to be afther
<br/>the oggling and a goggling at her leddyship in that fashion,”
<br/>and jist wid that such another squaze as it was I giv’d her
<br/>flipper, all as much as to say, “ isn’t it Sir Pathrick now,
<br/>my jewel, that’ll he able to the proticting o’ you, my dar-
<br/>lint ?” and then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way
<br/>of the answer. “ Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as
<br/>plain as iver a squaze said in the world, “ Thrue for you,
<br/>Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman
<br/>ye are—that God’s truth,” and wid that she opened her two
<br/>beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha com d out of her
<br/>hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a
<br/>cat at Mounseer Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors
<br/>at mesilf.</p>
                  <p>“ Thin," says he, the willian, “ Och hon ! and a woolly-
<br/>wou, pully-wou,” and thin wid that he shoved up his two
<br/>shoulders till the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskiver-
<br/>ed, and thin he let down the two corners of his purraty-trap,
<br/>and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git
<br/>out o’ the spalpeen.</p>
                  <p>Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unra-
<br/>sonable mad thin, and the more by token that the Finchman
<br/>kipt an wid his winking at the widdy; and the widdy
<br/>she kip tan wid the squazing of my flipper, as much as to say,
<br/>“ At him again Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen;” so
<br/>I jist ripped out wid a big oath, and says I,</p>
                  <p>“ Ye little spalpeer.y frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody-
<br/>noun !”—and jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddy-
<br/>ship did ? Troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was
<br/>bit, and made all through the door, while I turned my head
<br/>round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and bothera-
<br/>tion, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I
<br/>had a rason of my own for the knowing that she could’nt git
<br/>down the stairs althegither and entirely; for I knew very
<br/>well that I had hould of her hand, for divil the bit had I
<br/>iver lit it go. And says I,</p>
                  <p>“Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that
<br/>ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship ? Come back
<br/>now, that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper." But afl
<br/>she wint down the stairs like a shot, and then I turned round
<br/>to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn't his
<br/>spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own—why
<br/>thin—thin it was'nt—that’s all.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page131"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <p>And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright
<br/>wid the laffin, to behould the little chap when he found out
<br/>that it wasn’t the widdy at all at all that he had had hould
<br/>of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick O’Grandison. The ould
<br/>divil himsilf niver behild sich a long face as he pet an! As
<br/>for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the
<br/>likes of his riverence to be afther the minding a thrifle of a
<br/>mistake. Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth) that
<br/>afore I lift hould of the flipper of the spalpeen, (which was
<br/>not till afther her leddyship’s futmen had kicked us both
<br/>down the stairs,) I gived it such a nate little broth of a
<br/>squaze, as made it all up into raspberry jam.</p>
                  <p>“Wouly-wou,” says he, “pully-wou,” says he—“Cot
<br/>tam !”</p>
                  <p>And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his
<br/>lift hand in a sling.</p>

ACT. I.
                 <p>Scene I.—In Clairvoir’s house.—A drawingroom, with three win-
<br/>dows, having Venetian blinds on the outside. The sashes of the
<br/>windows are raised, and the blinds of one of them bowed, with the
<br/>laths inclining downwards. At this latter window, Mary Mild-
<br/>may is seen sitting, in a listless attitude, as though she were
<br/>looking idly into the street; her cheek rests upon one hand,
<br/>while the other holds some needlework negligently upon her lap.</p>
                  <p>Enter Catharine, gaily. She runs up to Mary, clapping her
<br/>hands together</p>
                  <p>Cath. They're at it! they’re at it! Coz ! cousin Mary ! Why,
<br/>what the deuce is in the girl ? [ Shaking her.] Here is the greatest<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>sport in the world going on, and all within doors; yet you sit there
<br/>moping, gazing through the blinds at dirt-carts and omnibuses, as
<br/>if there were poetry in dust and music in wagon wheels ! Have
<br/>you no respect for science ? no regard for the exaltation of human
<br/>nature ? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
                    <p>Mary. I am not in spirits, Kate.</p>
                    <p>Cath. [Mimicking.] Not in spirits, Kate ! Not in liquor, I
<br/>suppose. Now, if you were a man, I should verily believe you
<br/>were. But I’ll tell you what you are in, Mary : you are in love;
<br/>and that’s the most spiritless thing in the world, I’m sure.</p>
                    <p>Mary. [Rising.] I should hope not, cousin; for then, poor
<br/>Mr. Walton!</p>
                    <p>Cath. Well, that sounds somewhat like life. And now, since
<br/>you are fairly roused, let us off to the library. [Brings her for-
<br/>ward.] Come, instead of watching for Mr. Arnold Dulruse, let us
<br/>see what Mr. Arnold’s mother is doing to my papa and your
<br/>uncle.</p>
                    <p>Mary. But, Kate dear, how can you tease one so ? You know
<br/>I never—that is—I mean—I never now like to talk of Arnold.</p>
                    <p>Cath. No, but—that is—I mean—you love to think on him.
<br/>Ha, ha! my gentle, and most constant, and grave, and pensive
<br/>Mary, how you blush!</p>
                      <p>Mary. You have bad eyes, cousin.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Then Schuyler tells me very great fibs. The dear, good-
<br/>for-nothing, rhyming!—Did’nt he say that—let me see, what was
<br/>it? O! [Declaiming.] “ Oh, by those eyes, whose rays are like
<br/>—are like—O! are like the stars, that through the blue of hea-
<br/>ven their”—and so on. There, you malicious little devil, you see
<br/>that I am greater than Atlas. I bear a firmament between my
<br/>eyelids, and am a sort of peripatetic animated universe, or at least,
<br/>a circumambulatory supercelestial! Bad eyes, you envious crea-
<br/>ture ! Stars! stars ! and of the first magnitude. When did your
<br/>dull, prosaical lover, ever say anything half so fine to you ?</p>
                    <p>Mary. Why, in truth, never. And I am much obliged to him;
<br/>for, had he likened my eyes to stars, I should have thought that he
<br/>felt himself in the dark when under their beams, and that a release
<br/>to the streets was a welcome escape into daylight, or a waking
<br/>from the night into morning. Of trite similes, the sun is rather
<br/>more cheerful and vivifying, if one must have such celestial non-
<br/>sense.</p>
                    <p>Cath. I vow, I’ll pinch you to death. But come, coz.</p>
                    <p>Mary. Where ?</p>
                    <p>Cath. To see Papa play Mr. Peale to Mrs. Dulrusers Blind
<br/>Lady : the museum, our little library. Letty saw them go there a
<br/>minute ago. By this time, the curtain must be up, and the farce
<br/>will want spectators. Come, Mary darling, I would’nt miss the
<br/>scene for worlds.</p>
                    <p>Mary. But cannot you go alone, Kate ? I—I would rather—I
<br/>would rather not go, cousin ; because—because—</p>
                    <p>Cath. Because you had rather stay here, to look from the win-
<br/>dow, and fancy every orangeman you see is about to be metamor-
<br/>phosed into sober Mr. Dulruse, with his arm full of golden compli-
<br/>ments and fragrant suavities, just imported from Cyprus, and to
<br/>wish that the next image-vender were your solemn beau, with all
<br/>his little plaster Cupids turned into spiritual, ardent, real Loves, and
<br/>nestling in his head, instead of spreading their squab wings on the
<br/>boarded top of it.</p>
                    <p>Mary. Indeed, indeed, Catharine, you mistake me ; I was not
<br/>—not looking for Arnold. [Bursts into tears.]</p>
                    <p>Cath. [Rising and embracing her affectionately.] And sup-
<br/>pose that you were, dear, good Mary ! Now, do forgive me : in-
<br/>deed I did not mean to vex you; and I cannot see any harm in
<br/>one's wishing for one’s sweetheart.</p>
                    <p>Mary. But I assure you, Catharine, I had no such idea. I
<br/>should—I confess—be glad to see Arnold—though, perhaps, after
<br/>his—his late—neglect, I ought not; but that, really, was not my
<br/>motive.</p>
                    <p>Cath. Well, I wont ask you. We will let Papa amuse him-
<br/>self without us. There ! kiss me once more, to show that you for-
<br/>give me : you know I am such a rattle; I am always saying things
<br/>I ought not.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page132"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                    <p>Mary. But there is no harm done, Kate; and I am not angry.</p>
                    <p>Cath. No, you dear soul, you are too sweet-tempered ever to be
<br/>angry. [Kissing her again and embracing.]</p>
                      <p>Mary. Come, cousin ; don’t mistake me for yourself, and your-
<br/>self for Mr. Walton.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Not quite, or you would not have had that kiss.</p>
                      <p>Mary. Hum!</p>
                      <p>Cath. Now, I will pinch you. You’re a naughty, malicious—</p>
                      <p>Mary. Oh yes ! an old receipt to hide confusion. Whose turn
<br/>is it now, Kate ?	[A loud ringing heard, as of a door-bell.]</p>
                      <p>Cath. Why, yours again; and to lose color, too. I told you,
<br/>you expected—</p>
                      <p>Mary. No. Kate, upon my word! Indeed ! I am sure it is not
<br/>he. [Sighing.] That is Mr. Walton.</p>
                      <p>Cath. A dozen pair of gloves, it is not! Run to the window;
<br/>you can’t be seen. Pshaw! you're a snail! Let me. [Looks
<br/>through the blinds for a second, and comes back blushing and con-
<br/>fused.]</p>
                      <p>Mary. You’ve lost. I knew it—[Sighing]—and you never lost
<br/>a wager more willingly.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Not since it gives you pain, believe me, dear Mary.
<br/>But where is the girl going ? Mr. Walton wont eat you up.</p>
                      <p>Mary. No, but he would be cross enough to snap at me, if I
<br/>staid. There’s the door shut. Three spoils company. [Going.]</p>
                      <p>Cath. And one should do as one should be done by, ah, coz.'
<br/>[Running after and hugging her. Exit Mary.] The dear,
<br/>sweet girl! What a pity she should have such a lover!</p>
                      <p>Enter Walton.</p>
                      <p>Walt. What lover is that, Catharine, that is so happy as to be
<br/>the object of your pity ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Not you, Schuyler; or I should wish you far enough.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Why, yes; for Pity, if akin to Love, is one of that sort
<br/>of poor relations we are seldom proud to acknowledge.</p>
                      <p>Cath. True ; for nine times out of ten, Contempt is in the fam-
ily.</p>
                      <p>Walt. And, the tenth time, she may be found to bo a twin-sis-
<br/>ter. Happy fellow, if such be the lineage of the gentleman now in
<br/>question.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Why, whom are you talking of now ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. The lover, surely, whom you named as I entered.</p>
                      <p>Cath. It would fit him well, in the case. But my pity was not
<br/>bestowed upon the lover, but the lady. Poor Mary !</p>
                      <p>Walt. Your cousin, Miss Mildmay ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Yes; and I wonder more and more, every day, what a
<br/>girl of her good taste could have seen in that sour Mr. Dulruse to
<br/>bewitch her; and, were it not for her evident uneasiness, I should
<br/>really rejoice at his present indifference : he is quite unworthy of
<br/>so good a girl, I am sure, and some other man might one day make
<br/>her fur happier than her tender nature could ever hope to be with
<br/>a person of his character.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Generous creature ! I do love you so, for that very love
<br/>you bear your orphan cousin.</p>
                      <p>Cath. What! more than for my eyes? the stars, you know.
<br/>Take care, Mr. Poet; I shall be jealous.</p>
                      <p>Walt. And you will have cause, Catharine, whenever your vir-
<br/>tues seem inferior to Miss Mildmay’s.</p>
                      <p>Cath. And are my eyes then to count for nothing ? O sacrile-
<br/>gious and rebellious wretch! I must have you to your rhymes
<br/>again. When did I give you leave to forget my beauty in the cat-
<br/>alogue of my numerous qualifications ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. When you taught me that your heart outshone it, and
<br/>that your mind was its divinest essence. [Kissing her hand.]</p>
                      <p>Cath. Well; pretty well, that: your disloyalty is atoned for.
<br/>And now, let go my fingers, and I will tell you a secret. First,
<br/>what do you think of Mrs. Dulruse ? Come, don't hesitate.</p>
                      <p>Walt. If my position will excuse my speaking so plainly. Yet,
<br/>I would rather not.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Fie, Schuyler! what scrupulosity! Why, she is only
<br/>our housekeeper—as yet, thank Heaven! and you know I do not
<br/>like her.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                      <p>Walt. Yet, she is a lady; at least she has been so accounted;
<br/>and, at all events, she is a woman.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Well then, since you are so delicate, I will be your
<br/>mouthpiece. I will speak for you; and you shall see how well I
<br/>can read your thoughts.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Take care you don’t misspell.</p>
                      <p>Cath. You shall ferule my hand, if I do. Nay, don’t take hold
<br/>of it already ; I have not yet missed. You think her, Schuyler, an
<br/>artful, heartless, and mercenary woman, whose will, were it but
<br/>assisted by her intellect, would render her dangerous ; but her ig-
<br/>norance makes her blunder, and her scheming degenerates, through
<br/>her fatuity, into mere cunning.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Which is the intelligence of vulgar minds. You have
<br/>read me well. Now, what follows?</p>
                      <p>Cath. How would you like her for a mother-in-law ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. Like her ? But that is impossible!</p>
                      <p>Cath. What then if she become my mother?</p>
                      <p>Walt. Good God! your father—Mr. Clairvoir cannot be so
<br/>blind ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Indeed, but he is: the deluded are always so. And they
<br/>are at this very moment about it.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Surely, it cannot be; there is some mistake; you are
<br/>not so unhappy. Gone to be married !</p>
                      <p>Cath. I did not say so. But they are going through with the
<br/>preliminaries; courtship and infatuation.</p>
                      <p>Walt. I do not understand you. You talk, Catharine, of what
<br/>should be a misery to you, and would be, did not our own marriage
<br/>promise you a speedy release from it; yet there is a laughing hu-
<br/>mor in those darling eyes, and a smile about those beautiful lips,
<br/>that—</p>
                      <p>Cath. I had better tell you at once, I see; for you are lapsing
<br/>into poetry and flattery. Did you ever hear of Animal Magnetism,
<br/>or Mesmerism, or whatever other ism, except skepticism, you may
<br/>choose to name it ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. Surely; who has not?</p>
                      <p>Cath. And do you believe in it ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. Do I believe that I can see without eyes, hear without
<br/>ears, smell without a nose, taste without a tongue, and feel without
<br/>either feet or hands ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Well, my father does; and some book that he has lately
<br/>been reading, has carried his credulity to a pitch that is absolute
<br/>fanaticism. Now, Mrs. Dulruse has for a long time been making
<br/>love to him.</p>
                      <p>Walt. Nothing uncommon in the house-keeper of a wealthy
<br/>widower.</p>
                      <p>Cath. So I suppose; but it is not the more agreeable for all
<br/>that. Well, what does the cunning creature do, but gradually, af-
<br/>ter a little well-managed resistance, become a convert to these fan-
<br/>tastical doctrines. My father, of course, was vastly delighted, the
<br/>more so that I had made free to ridicule their nonsense, and con-
<br/>ceiving that there might be some undiscovered magnetic affinities
<br/>between himself and the amiable Dulruse, he yesterday set him-
<br/>self to explore the localities, doubtless with the full consent of the
<br/>proprietress. My Letty, who is about the cleverest maid that
<br/>ever lady was blest with, has, I have lately seen, much to my vex-
<br/>ation, been slily amusing herself with the growing cordiality of my
<br/>father and his housekeeper, and, shrewdly suspecting that the lat-
<br/>ter, (whom she hates as cordially as her good nature will let her
<br/>hate anything,) would make some rare use of the new experiments,
<br/>she took the liberty of listening and peeping in the keyhole of the
<br/>library, where they were performed. I have reprimanded her for
<br/>this impropriety, and forbid her repeating it; but I could not pre-
<br/>vent myself from hearing what she came in haste to tell me. You
<br/>look grave, Schuyler: was I wrong ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. I think you were; you should have stopped her at once,
<br/>my dear girl.</p>
                      <p>Cath. And I believe I should, had I had time to make the reso-
<br/>lution; but Letty took me quite by surprise, and, before I knew
<br/>what I was about she had emptied her entire budget for my bene
<br/> fit. And what do you think it amounted to ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. I do not like to guess.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page133"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                      <p>Cath. Why, that Mrs. Dulruse has an actual design to entrap
<br/>my father into a speedy, if not an immediate marriage.</p>
                      <p>Walt. But the girl may have deceived herself.</p>
                      <p>Cath. No, no; she is the shrewdest of the shrewd. Besides,
<br/>my dear Schuyler, I drew precisely the same conclusion from
<br/>what she told me, as she herself had done. Now, have you a de-
<br/>sire to observe this folly ?</p>
                      <p>Walt. How ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Simply, by being a spectator of it. Just before yon
<br/>came in Papa led his inamorata to the library, Letty tells me ; and
<br/>there is no doubt he is now manipulating on her wrinkled sinciput,
<br/>and making, as he supposes (I should blush to say it of my father,
<br/>to any body but you,) his spirit pass into hers over the very ethereal
<br/>bridge of his thumbs. I wanted Mary to go in with me to see this
<br/>demonstration of the separability of the soul; but she refused, poor
<br/>thing, I suspect, because of late—from—from—for a certain reason
<br/>which I cannot name to you now, Mrs. Dulruse has treated her
<br/>with no little insolence, and she believes her (very rightly, if she
<br/>knew all) to be the chief cause of her son’s estrangement.</p>
                      <p>Walt. But how will your father relish our intrusion ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. Be delighted with it. He will glory in the demonstra-
<br/>tion of his fancied science. Come. But first, we’ll endeavor to 
<br/>persuade Mary to join us; I long to open the eyes of that innocent
<br/>creature to the character of the Dulruses, mother and son: she
<br/>should not marry that man.</p>
                      <p>Walt. You are very right: she were better dead. I will go
<br/>with you.</p>
                      <p>Cath. Mary is in the next room. Before we go to the library, 
<br/>I will ring for Letty, that she may repeat before you what she
<br/>knows of this intrigue, as I fear it to be on one side; and you shall 
<br/>draw your own conclusions. Do not fear; the girl is not an ordi-
<br/>nary servant; she may safely be made a confidant. And besides,
<br/>Schuyler, nothing, that is not dishonorable, should stand in our
<br/>way, to prevent a consummation as melancholy almost for you as it
<br/>would be for me.</p>
                    <p>Walt. Sensible girl. [Kissing her hand.]</p>
                    <p>Cath. Fie! you are as bad as my father. Does good sense lie
<br/>to the fingers ?</p>
                    <p>Walt. No, Kate, but a most delicate sensation does. [Exeunt,
<br/>at the tide.]</p>
Scene II.
                      <p>Scene II.—A room of smaller dimensions, surrounded with shelves of 
<br/>books. Globes, maps, and the various other articles usual in a pri-
<br/>vate library. Mrs. Dulruse is discovered seated in a Voltaire-chair,
<br/>in the position and with the appearance proper to the magnetic slum-
<br/>ber. Clairvoir, seated before her in another chair. Just as the
<br/>scene opens, he throws himself back in his seat, and gazes with a show
<br/>of admiration on his patient.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Wonderful, celestial science ! Where now are the prim-
<br/>ordial bounds which would-be philosophers have pretended were
<br/>set by Nature to human action and to human thought ? Man, no
<br/>longer a creature of the elements, no more a slave to the narrow
<br/>Powers excited by mere blood, and bones, and muscle.—man, the
<br/>spirit, not the carcase, shall not now say unto the worm, " Thou
<br/>art my mother and my sister,” but unto the angels, " Ye are my
<br/>brethren” : for he is now, omnipotent, ubiquitous,—ah ! he may be
<br/>omniscient. Then, seeing all, knowing all, penetrating into all
<br/>space and at one time, he shall be greater than the angels. Glo-
<br/>rious aspirations ! Nor let it be deemed profane: have not pious
<br/>men proclaimed it lawful ? Has not Heaven given us these pow-
<br/>ers to be used ? Heaven laid the magnet where, in process of time,
<br/>it was discovered; and, in a still longer process, man applied it to
<br/>its destined purpose; and Heaven gave us these magnetic affinities,
<br/>which, suspected long ago, but only discovered in their full extent
<br/>within a brief period, set man at once above all former sublunary
<br/>considerations. What now need he travel for, at the risk of life, to
<br/>foreign countries ? Seated in his chair, he wills himself into the
<br/>mind of another and congenial spirit, who, at his direction, travels
<br/>in thought to all quarters of the world, without moving an inch—
<br/>sees now the British massacre in China,—now counts the Arabs
<br/>slaughtered in Algiers, and now prognosticates the sex of the forth-
<br/>coming issue of Victoria ; and the tally conveyance, and uncertain <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>news, of mails and steam-packets, are entirely superseded. Disease
<br/>itself has henceforth no secret. I will my amiable Dorothy to look
<br/>into my bowels; she does so: she sees at a glance what is there
<br/>disturbed, what needs repairing; and the doctor, no more working
<br/>in the dark, prescribes with safety, and Death is bid defiance.
<br/>Hail, mysterious source of— What am I doing ! I, who till now
<br/>have ridiculed soliloquies upon the stage, in my rapture guilty of
<br/>as great a folly! Yet no; I do not speak alone and to myself;
<br/>there sits my coadjutor, my sympathetic Dolly ; and doubtless, at
<br/>this moment, though locked, by the semi-gyration of my thumbs, in
<br/>a slumber which, as has been properly said, “ a park of artillery
<br/>would not disturb,” she hears all, and sees all, as though she were
<br/>awake. Do you not, madam ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. As clear as starch.</p>
                      <p>Clair. I thought so! I thought so! Wonderful!—a few more
<br/>experiments, and I will release you from this fatiguing, though ec-
<br/>static trance. Let us mount into the moon : I want to know what
<br/>the people there are doing. Here, give me your hands.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But you must n’t let me fall.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Never fear, madam. Are you ready ? Let us fly then !
<br/>[He lifts her hands up and down, to imitate the motion of wings.]</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. O, what a wondersome height. But I shall fall
<br/>Mercy on me ! my head goes round like a top.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Hold fast, then. And, faith, you do ! You squeeze like
<br/>the devil. Not quite so hard. There ; are you there ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes, I am in a wonderful place. It does n’t look like
<br/>green cheese : that must be a lie.</p>
                      <p>Clair. No doubt; no doubt. Do you see any mountains, mad-
<br/>am, and valleys ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes, a great many of’em ; one ever so big; six times
<br/>as high as the Catskills, and with trees growing on the top of it.
<br/>Lor' ! it’s shaped like a man’s nose: it must be a part of the face
<br/>we see in the full moon.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Very likely. But they must have a wonderful climate
<br/>there, for trees to grow at such a height.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes; but then, there are none in the valleys.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Ah! I see! I see! That explains it. Everything is just
<br/>the reverse of what it is here on earth. Wonderful!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Oh yes; there goes a man, walking as fast as ever ha
<br/>can, on his head. Good gracious!</p>
                      <p>Clair. Are you sure!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes; for he meets a lady, and they touch heels go-
<br/>gether.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Toes, you mean.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes, toes, to salute one another.</p>
                      <p>Clair How are they dressed ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Spare my blushes. I do declare—I—don’t ask me ;
<br/>but I don’t think they have anything on them; not a rag. The
<br/>nasty beasts!</p>
                      <p>Clair. A state of innocence and unsophisticated nature. No
<br/>stocks there fluctuate with the rise and fall of cotton; no quarrels
<br/>threaten from an agitated tariff on silks. Do you see any water ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Oceans full; and, my stars! there is a man on the
<br/>shore milking a whale ! Did you ever!</p>
                      <p>Clair. The very thing Locke said! I never could have believed
<br/>it. Does he do it standing ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. No; he's lying on his face, feet foremost.</p>
                      <p>Clair. And draws the udder with his toes ! A strange variety
<br/>of the genus Homo. Are you tired, my dear ? shall we descend ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. If you please; it feels too cold here. [She shudders,
<br/>and her teeth chatters.] But don’t let me fall.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Never fear. [She puts her arm about his neck.] That’s
<br/>right. But, the deuse! don’t hug so hard; or you’ll strangle me.
<br/>There; are you home ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes. O me! I’m so tired !</p>
                      <p>Clair. And what do you see here ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Mr. Walton is in the drawing-room, courting Miss
<br/>Clairvoir.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Like enough ; the bell rung a little while ago. Well,
<br/>that is all right.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D- Ah, I’m afeard not!</p>
                      
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page134"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                      
                      <p>Clair. No ? Why not ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. She never will marry him.</p>
                      <p>Clair. The deuse she won’t ! This is had news. Are you very
<br/>sure ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes; another match is laid out for her, that will make
<br/>her case so much happier. He will be the richest man in the city,
<br/>—twice as rich as John Jacob Astor; and they will have lots of
<br/>children.</p>
                      <p>Clair. But who is he ? who is he ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. I blush to say. Do not ask me!</p>
                      <p>Clair. Nay, dear madam ; speak out: nobody hears you.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But will you forgive me ?</p>
                      <p>Clair. Surely; I cannot help fate: you see but what will hap-
<br/>pen.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. And what ought to happen; for shockin’ things will
<br/>take place, if it don't, Mr. Clairvoir. It is---</p>
                      <p>Clair. Who ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. His name begins with A, and ends with E.</p>
                      <p>Clair. A ? and ends with E ? Who can that be ? [to himself."]</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Now I see him clearly: he kneels to ask my blessing,
<br/>and his wife kneels to ask her father’s; what a lovely couple ! It
<br/>is my son! my Arnold ! Did I ever ?</p>
                      <p>Clair. Why, no I never ! This I don’t like.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But it is writ in Heaven; and it must be.</p>
                      <p>Clair. But perhaps we may avoid it; for I tell you, widow, she
<br/>is promised to Schuyler Walton, as fine a fellow as ever darkened
<br/>a house door;—and there are other reasons besides.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But what must be, will be ; and Mr. Walton laughs at
<br/>the science, and mocks at you.</p>
                      <p>Clair. How do you know that ? Did you ever hear him ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. No, but I see it as plain as I see the whales, and every
<br/>other thing in this sumnamberlism.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Somnambulism, my dear. If I thought so!—But what
<br/>else do you see ? What is my dearest wish at this moment ?
<br/>Come, tell me that; it is my last experiment for to-day.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. It is—spare my blushes.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Pshaw ! my dear; no one sees you, but me,</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. That's true ; and then, I'm forced to speak ; or I would
<br/>n’t. Your dearest wish is----</p>
                      <p>Clair. —To?</p>
                      <p>Mrs.D. —Consummate our union. [Clairvoir starts back, and
<br/>Mrs. D. covers her face as if ashamed.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. The devil it is ! Why I never thought on it. Are you
<br/>very sure, Mrs. Dulruse ?</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Very sure, Mr. Clairvoir.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Then I don’t know my own mind.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. How should you as well as I ? Did n't you give me
<br/>the power to enter it ? I can’t help it, if you willed it so. And
<br/>you might have a thought, you know, which was kind o’ dim to
<br/>yourself, but which I could see ever so plain.</p>
                      <p>Clair. And that is true ; for you are fast asleep.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Besides, what was you just talking of? Was’nt it of
<br/>Mr. Walton and Miss Catharine ?</p>
                      <p>Clair. True.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Well, what so near to a father as his daughter? So,
<br/>thinking of her, you must have thought of yourself, you know, and,
<br/>thinking of her marriage, your own must have occurred to you,
<br/>don’t you see, and having occurred to you, why, you must have
<br/>wished it at this moment.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Why, that I am not so sure of. But then, the science
<br/>cannot be mistaken.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Nor can I resist your will, Mr. Clairvoir. If you was
<br/>to send me to the Bad Place, I must go there; and if you willed me
<br/>to look into your mind, I had to do it; your power is omipertent.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Angelic creature !	[ Throws his arm in ecstasy about
<br/>her neck.] What a union of congenial spirits will ours be!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Dear Mr. Clairvoir! [Throwing her arms in turn
<br/>about him.] Oh, dear me ! I shall die of shame!</p>
                      <p>Clair. Poor soul! she cannot help betraying her love in this
<br/>magnetic condition!</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
                      <p>Mrs. D. No, in this pathetic position I cannot indeed help dis-
<br/>playing it. [kisses him.]</p>
                      <p>[At this moment, enter Walton and Catharine. They stop, confused,
<br/>and gaze at one another.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. What a life of immateriality will ours be !</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes, pure materiality ! [kissing him.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. No corporeity to obfuscate our intellectual enjoyments!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. No, no paupereity to puzzball our effectual enjoyments!
<br/>oh, my love ! [Hugging him ]</p>
                      <p>Clair. We shall see with magnetic vision, feel by magnetic
<br/>affinity.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. O, Mr. Clairvoir! spare my blushes!</p>
                      <p>Clairvoir. —Do all things by magnetic, somnambulistic, sym-
<br/>pathetic correspondence. A life of unsensuality, without admix-
<br/>ture ! [Hugging.]</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Yes, a life of sensuality, without fixtures! Let us be-
<br/>gin it at once. O, O, O, dear, darling, apathetic magnetiser!
<br/>[Hugging.]</p>
                      <p>Cath. [Recovering. Aside to Walton.] What say you now?
<br/>O	my father! how I blush for him ! Let us go.</p>
                      <p>Walt. [Aside to Cath.] You are very right: a child should not
<br/>be the willing observer of its parent’s follies.</p>
                      <p>Clair. [Standing up, and disengaging himself] Eh! what’s
<br/>that ? Confusion!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. [Pretending to be still fast sleep ] Clairvoir, don't
<br/>leave me.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Hush! Mrs. D.; there are persons present. Poor
<br/>thing ! she can see and hear only me. Wonderful! Mr. Walton,
<br/>Catharine ; don’t go. Mrs. Dulruse has been so kind as to permit
<br/>me to manipulate her: I have made some wonderful experiments:
<br/>would you like to see them continued ?</p>
                      <p>Cath. No, no, papa; we will go. Come [aside to Walt.] don't
<br/>stay.</p>
                      <p>Clair. But Mr. Walton [Detaining him,] would perhaps like to
<br/>see them, Kate. And my wish was, just this moment, (at least, I
<br/>thought so ; though Mrs. Dulruse says it was not,) to have specta-
<br/>tors of my great discoveries. Come, Walton, my boy, I will put
<br/>her into communication with you. Take her hand.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. O no, Mr. Clairvoir; don't! I don’t want to have evil
<br/>communication with any body but you.</p>
                      <p>Walt. You had better wake her up; if she’s not so already.</p>
                      <p>Clair. So already ! Walton! Schuyler Walton! Are you stu-
<br/>pid ? Why, sir,—look at that excellent woman. Not a pack of
<br/>artillery exploding in her ears would wake her; not the thunder of
<br/>heaven, sir; yet I, I sir, poor human being as I am, I, Harry Clair-
<br/>voir, can rouse her by the will, by the mere energy of my spirit.
<br/>Behold !</p>
                      <p>Cath. Oh dear, my father is stark mad ! [aside.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. Awake, Mrs. Dulruse; awake to this grosser existence.
<br/>[Waving his hand magnetically over her forehead] : I will it.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. [Starting and opening her eyes.] Where?—what’s
<br/>the matter? [Rubbing her eyes, and staring round in seeming con-
<br/>fusion] Who ?—O! I see; I am dead with shame.</p>
                      <p>Clair. You should be alive with glory, Mrs. Dulruse! [Taking
<br/>her hand.] It is the victory of science; the triumph of immortal
<br/>mind over corrupt matter; the exaltation of spirituality over corpo-
<br/>rality! Walton, study magnetism; I will lend you Townshend,
<br/>Hartshorne, Stone: your sons shall be magnetisers, and your
<br/>daughters—</p>
                      <p>Walt, [aside to Cath.] Dulruses, I suppose.—I thank you, sir;
</p>
            <p>I	am quite contented that they should have their simple senses like
<br/>their father, and their every-day virtues like their lovely mother.
<br/>[Exeunt Walt. and Cath.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. Sir! no respect for your immortal nature? no belief in the
<br/>mind's independence of the corporeal faculties? [ Turning before
<br/>they are quite gone.] Did you ever, Mrs. Dulruse!</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Why, no I never! And I must say, Mr. Clairvoir—</p>
                      <p>Clair. That Walton treats me damned shabbily. Look you, sir I
<br/>Eh ! gone ? In my own house ? He, I see plainly, has no sympa-
<br/>thy with science, no congeniality of feeling.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. I told yon so: no congenitality for feeling at all.</p>

                      <p>Mrs. D. You’d best let Miss Catharine.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Perhaps I may. The disrespectful!—Simple senses, in-
<br/>deed! Mere corporality sentiment; no capability of comprehend-
<br/>ing this mystical agent! Come, my better half.</p>
                      <p>Mrs D. [Affecting coyness.] I am not so yet, sir.</p>
                      <p>Clair. Yes, in your spirit.</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But my body.</p>
                      <p>Clair. I’ll magnetize that to-morrow—[Going.]</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. But the ring will be well to keep it fast, Mr. Clairvoir.
<br/>[Tagging behind.]</p>
                      <p>Clair. Time enough for that, my congenial spirit. Mere corpo-
<br/>rality! no reverence for this mystic agent! [Exit, shutting the
<br/>door after him in his abstraction.]</p>
                      <p>Mrs. D. Time enough, you old fool, you? Let me get it once;
<br/>and I’ll make the body fact enough to you. That for your con-
<br/>genitals ! that for your pauperalities and fiscal agents ! [Exit.]</p>

                  <div class="head">The Valley of Unrest.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>Once it smiled a silent dell
<br/>Where the people did not dwell;
<br/>They had gone unto the wars,
<br/>Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
<br/>Nightly, from their azure towers,
<br/>To keep watch above the flowers,
<br/>In the midst of which all day
<br/>The red sun-light lazily lay.
<br/>Now each visitor shall confess
<br/>The sad valley’s restlessness.
<br/>Nothing there is motionless—
<br/>Nothing save the airs that brood
<br/>Over the magic solitude.
<br/>Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
<br/>That palpitate like the chill seas
<br/>Around the misty Hebrides!
<br/>All, by no wind those clouds are driven
<br/>That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
<br/>Unceasingly, from morn till even,
<br/>Over the violets there that lie
<br/>In myriad types of the human eye—
<br/>Over the lilies there that wave
<br/>And weep above a nameless grave!
<br/>They wave:—from out their fragrant tops
<br/>Eternal dews come down in drops.
<br/>They weep:—from off their delicate stems
<br/>Perennial tears descend in gems.</div>

            <div class="lg">
               <br/>The mountain pinnacles slumber ; valleys, crags and caves are silent.</div>
                <p>“ Listen to me," said the Demon, as he placed his hand
<br/>upon my head. “ The region of which I speak is a dreary
<br/>region in Libya, by the borders of the river Zaire- And
<br/>there is no quiet there, nor silence.</p>
                  <p>“ The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue,
<br/>and they flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever
<br/>and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous
<br/>and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of
<br/>the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies.
<br/>They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch to-
<br/>wards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to
<br/>nd fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>murmur which cometh out from among them like the rush-
<br/>ing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.</p>
                 <p>“ But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of
<br/>the dark, horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about
<br/>the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually.
<br/>But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall
<br/>primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crash-
<br/>ing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one
<br/>by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange
<br/>poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And
<br/>overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray clouds
<br/>rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the
<br/>fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout
<br/>the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is
<br/>neither quiet nor silence.</p>
                  <p>“ It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain,
<br/>but, having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass
<br/>among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head—and
<br/>the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their
<br/>desolation.</p>
                  <p>“ And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghast-
<br/>ly mist, and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon
<br/>a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river, and
<br/>was lighted by the light of the moon. And the rock was gray,
<br/>and ghastly, and tall,— and the rock was gray. Upon
<br/>its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I
<br/>walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close
<br/>unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the
<br/>stone. But I could not decypher them. And I was going
<br/>back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red,
<br/>and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the
<br/>characters;—and the characters were desolation.</p>
                  <p>“ And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the
<br/>summit of the rock ; and I hid myself among the water-lilies
<br/>that I might discover the actions of the man. And the man
<br/>was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his
<br/>shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the out-
<br/>lines of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the
<br/>features of a deity ; for the mantle of the night, and of the
<br/>mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered
<br/>the features of his face. And his brow was lofty with thought,
<br/>and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon
<br/>his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and dis-
<br/>gust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.</p>
                  <p>“ And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head up-
<br/>on his hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked
<br/>down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall
<br/>primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and in-
<br/>to the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter of the
<br/>lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man
<br/>trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat
<br/>upon the rock.</p>
                  <p>“ And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and
<br/>looked out upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow
<br/>ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies.
<br/>And the man listened to the sighs of the water lilies, and to
<br/>the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay
<br/>close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
<br/>And the man trembled in the solitude ;—but the night wan-
<br/>ed and he sat upon the rock.</p>
                  <p>" Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and
<br/>waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called
<br/>unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the
<br/>recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call,
<br/>and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and
<br/>roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay<br/>

               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
<br/>And the man trembled in the solitude ;—but the night wan-
<br/>ed and he sat upon the rock.</p>
                  <p>“ Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult;
<br/>and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before,
<br/>there had been no wind. And the heaven became livid
<br/>with the violence of the tempest—and the rain beat upon
<br/>the head of the man—and the floods of the river came down
<br/>—and the river was tormented into foam—and the water-
<br/>lilies shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled
<br/>before the wind—and the thunder rolled—and the lightning
<br/>fell—and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close
<br/>within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And
<br/>the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and
<br/>he sat upon the rock.</p>
                  <p>“ Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, 
<br/>the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and
<br/>the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies.
<br/>And they became accursed, and were still. And the moon
<br/>ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven—and the thunder
<br/>died away—and the lightning did not flash—and the clouds
<br/>hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and re-
<br/>mained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies
<br/>sighed no more—and the murmur was heard no longer from
<br/>among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast
<br/>illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the
<br/>rock, and they were changed ;—and the characters were si-
<br/>lence.</p>
                  <p>“ And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man,
<br/>and his countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly,
<br/>he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the
<br/>rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout the
<br/>vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
<br/>were silence. And the man shuddered, and turned his face
<br/>away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no
<br/>more.”</p>
                  <p>*********</p>
                  <p>Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in
<br/>the iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I
<br/>say, are glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth,
<br/>and of the mighty sea—and of the Genii that over-ruled the
<br/>sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much
<br/>lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and
<br/>holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that
<br/>trembled around Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable
<br/>which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shad-
<br/>ow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all! And
<br/>as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within
<br/>the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh
<br/>with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not
<br/>laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb,
<br/>came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon,
<br/>and looked at him steadily in the face.</p>

<br/>Genius and Character of Burns. By Professor Wilson.</p>
                      <p>That Professor Wilson is one of the most gifted and alto-
<br/>gether one of the most remarkable men of his day, few per-
<br/>sons will be weak enough to deny. His ideality—his en-
<br/>thusiastic appreciation of the beautiful, conjoined with a
<br/>temperament compelling him into action and expression, has
<br/>been the root of his preeminent success. Much of it, un-
<br/>doubtedly, must be referred to that so-called moral courage<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>which is but the consequence of the temperament in its phy-
<br/>sical elements. In a word, Professor Wilson is what he
<br/>is, because he possesses ideality, energy and audacity, each
<br/>in a very unusual degree. The first, almost unaided by the
<br/>two latter, has enabled him to produce much impression, as
<br/>a poet, upon the secondary or tertiary grades of the poetic
<br/>comprehension. His “ Isle of Palms” appeals effectively, to
<br/>all those poetic intellects in which the poetic predominates
<br/>greatly over the intellectual element. It is a composition
<br/>which delights through the glow of its imagination, but
<br/>which repels (comparatively of course) through the niaiseries
<br/>of its general conduct and construction. As a critic, Profes-
<br/>sor Wilson has derived, as might easily be supposed, the
<br/>greatest aid from the qualities for which we have given him
<br/>credit—and it is in criticism especially, that it becomes very
<br/>difficult to say which of these qualities has assisted him the
<br/>most. It is sheer audacity, however, to which, perhaps,
<br/>after all, he is the most particularly indebted. How little
<br/>he owes to intellectual pre-eminence and how much to the
<br/>mere overbearing impetuosity of his opinions, would be a
<br/>singular subject for speculation. Nevertheless it is true,
<br/>that this rash spirit of domination would have served, with-
<br/>out his rich ideality, but to hurry him into contempt. Be
<br/>this as it may, in the first requisite of a critic the Scotch Ar-
<br/>istarchus is grossly deficient. Of one who instructs we de-
<br/>mand, in the first instance, a certain knowledge of the prin-
<br/>ciples which regulate the instruction. Professor Wilson's
<br/>capability is limited to a keen appreciation of the beautiful
<br/>and fastidious sense of the deformed. Why or how either is
<br/>either, he never dreams of pretending to inquire, because he
<br/>sees clearly his own inability to comprehend. He is no ana-
<br/>lyst. He is ignorant of the machinery of his own thoughts
<br/>and the thoughts of other men. His criticism is emphatically
<br/>on the surface—superficial. His opinions are mere dicta—
<br/>unsupported verba magistri—and are just or unjust at the
<br/>variable taste of the individual who reads them. He per-
<br/>suades—he bewilders—he overwhelms—at times he even
<br/>argues—but there has been no period at which he ever de-
<br/>monstrated anything beyond his own utter incapacity for
<br/>demonstration.</p>
                    <p>His “ Genius and Character of Burns” will place Profess-
<br/>sor Wilson in a clear, but not (for him) in the most advan-
<br/>tageous light. We may glean from this book, however, a
<br/>very accurate conception, if not of Burns, at least of Christo-
<br/>pher North. His most usual tone of thought and turn of
<br/>expression, are here happily conveyed. To the lovers of
<br/>mere rhapsody we can recommend the volume as one likely
<br/>to interest them ; to those who seek, in good faith, a guide
<br/>to the real Burns—to the merits and demerits, literary and
<br/>personal—of a man whose merits at least have been more
<br/>grossly—more preposterously exaggerated (through a series
<br/>of purely adventitious circumstances) than those of any man
<br/>that ever lived upon the earth—to these seekers of the sim-
<br/>ple truth, we say, you will look for it in vain in this volume
<br/>by Christopher North.</p>

<br/>First American Edition. Boston : Benjamin P. Mussey.
<br/>For sale in New-York by Redfield &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>The poetical and critical world of England were, about
<br/>six years ago, violently agitated (in spots) by the eruption of
<br/>“Festus,” a Vesuvius-cone at least—if not an Ӕtna—in
<br/>the literary cosmos. It is only lately, however,—within the
<br/>last eight or nine months, perhaps,—that anything more
<br/>than a mere rumor of the eruption has made its way to us.</p>
                    <p>This is the more strange, since “Festus" is, beyond ques-

                  <br/>tion, a poem of the most remarkable power, and since, in
<br/>general, we are ludicrously on the alert to catch the echoes
<br/>of the British opinion in respect to even the most nonsensical
<br/>books.</p>
                    <p>We shall speak of “Festus” hereafter, at length, as its
<br/>peculiarities deserve. At present, we have read it only in
<br/>snatches. In the meantime we may observe first, that its
<br/>author is, or was, at the period of its original publication, a
<br/>very young man, and secondly that his work has been laud-
<br/>ed in no stinted measure, by many of the best authorities in
<br/>Great Britain. Bulwer, for example, calls it “a most re-
<br/>markable and magnificent production.” Mrs. Hall says, “It
<br/>contains some of the most wonderful things I ever read.”
<br/>Horne, the author of “ Orion” (no common man and no com-
<br/>mon poem) speaks of its “unrepressed vigor of imagination”
<br/>—its “ splendor of great and original imagery”—its “ passion
<br/>of poetry.”</p>
                    <p>The design of “ Festus” may be stated, in brief, as the
<br/>demonstration of the necessity of Evil. We quote the con-
<br/>cluding Sonnet, which the poet affectedly calls “L’Envoi.”</p>

                  <br/>Read this, world ! He who writes is dead to thee,
<br/>But still lives in these leaves. He spake inspired:
<br/>Night and day thought came unhelped, undesired,
<br/>Like blood to his heart. The course of study he
<br/>Went through with was the soul-rack. The degree
<br/>He took was high : it was wise wretchedness.
<br/>He suffered perfectly, and gained no less
<br/>A prize than in his own tom heart to see
<br/>A few bright seeds: he sowed them—hoped them truth.
<br/>The autumn of that seed is in these pages.
<br/>God was with him, and bade old Time to the youth
<br/>Unclench his heart, and teach the book of ages.
<br/>Peace to thee, world!—farewell!—May God the Power,
<br/>And God the Love—and God the Grace be ours !</div>
                     <p>This sonnet happily conveys much of the prevalent tone of
<br/>the whole poem—its imperiousness—its egotism—its energy
<br/>—its daring—its ruggedness—its contempt of law in great
<br/>things and small. Observe the defective rhyme in the con-
<br/>clusion—a straw to show the way of the wind.</p>

                  <p>The great success of Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam’s “Library of
<br/>Choice Reading” has, we presume, stirred up the Mess. Ap-
<br/>pletons to the present laudable enterprise. We make an ex-
<br/>tract from their advertisement:</p>
                   <p>“ The publishers of the proposed “ Literary Melange,” believing
<br/>that there is still ample space for a uniform series of superior produc-
<br/>tions in the less erudite department of popular literature, which shall
<br/>fie distinctly characterized as combining amusement and instruction
<br/>With moral benefit, therefore have resolved to present to their friends
<br/>and the public, a miscellaneous library adapted for popular reading,
<br/>equally suited for the recreation of the scholar and the man of busi-
<br/>ness, after their more arduous toil has ended ; and to edify and en-
<br/>large the mind of their junior domestic associates. The limits of se-
<br/>lection will be uncircumscribed ; and the choice will be decided en-
<br/>tirely by the manifest excellence of the work, the importance of the
<br/>topics, or the proofs of genius and talent developed. The lite only
<br/>of those numerous tomes which are appropriate to the general design
<br/>will be incorporated in this miscellany.</p>
                    <p>“ Gertrude,” with which the series commences, is an inte-
<br/>resting, although by no means a “ powerful” story of ordina-
<br/>ry life. It inculcates the homely and domestic virtues—is
<br/>well written in every respect—and has been greatly praised<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>by the more decorous and influential of the British journals.

                    <p>Park Theatre.—We attended this establishment on
<br/>Saturday evening to witness the first appearance (in Ameri-
<br/>ca) of Mrs. Eland in the character of Pauline, in Bulwer’s
<br/>popular play “ The Lady of Lyons.”</p>
                    <p>Before remarking upon the lady's performance, we cannot
<br/>but make a few observations upon the circumstances of her 
<br/>first appearance. It would be impossible to select, through- 
<br/>out the entire year, an evening so entirely disadvantageous,
<br/>as the one chosen for Mrs. Bland’s debut. In the first
<br/>place, Saturday night, even upon ordinary occasions, is con-
<br/>fessedly the worst night of the week ; but Saturday night 
<br/>after a star engagement is but another term for empty bench-
<br/>es. Mr. Hackett had been playing all the week up to Friday,
<br/>and the Keans had been announced for several days to ap-
<br/>pear on the following Monday. Could circumstances have
<br/>been contrived more calculated to damn for ever the first ef-
<br/>forts of a lady in a new country ? We cannot believe that
<br/>the selection of the night was intended as a slight to Mrs,
<br/>Bland, because it would be against the interests of the Man-
<br/>ager, who would, one would think, take every opportunity of<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>ager, who would, one would think, take every opportunity
<br/>of placing the principal members of his establishment, in as
<br/>prominent and favorable a position as possible. We have
<br/>thought of every likely motive for such injurious and un-
<br/>fair conduct, and the only conclusion we will arrive at is,
<br/>that the strongest attraction which could be procured with
<br/>the least possible trouble, and without reference to the injury
<br/>likely to be sustained by the said attractor, was put forward
<br/>—or rather backward—on the worst possible night. We re-
<br/>gret this for the sake of the Lady—we regret it for the sake
<br/>of the Manager, and we regret it also, for the sake of the
<br/>Public, who have been deprived, for a time, of witnessing a
<br/>performance of the highest merit. We trust that Mr. Simp-
<br/>son will afford us an early opportunity of seeing Mrs. Bland
<br/>in some of her most prominent characters. The Lady of
<br/>Lyons has been represented so frequently of late, that we are
<br/>surprised to find that an audience can be collected to wit-
<br/>ness it.</p>
                    <p>The character of Pauline is easily defined, and though but
<br/>rarely represented as the author designed, is still a creation
<br/>consistent throughout. Her one great capacity is—Love:
<br/>deep, earnest and devoted love. Before this great principle
<br/>of her life has been developed, pride which is not native to
<br/>her mind, has been engrafted there, but harmonizes not at
<br/>all with the confiding nature of her true woman’s heart.
<br/>This pride has been severely shocked at the knowledge that
<br/>a peasant has dared to raise his hopes to her ; but it is sooth-
<br/>ed, comforted and excited, by the homage of a Prince’s heart.
<br/>When in the first flush of her almost unimagined happiness
<br/>the fatal truth breaks in upon her—that she has been deceiv-
<br/>ed—duped—exposed to the mockery and contempt of the
<br/>whole city, this pride, in a great struggle with her humble
<br/>nature, seems for a time to gain the mastery, when with
<br/>bitter scorn she asks her deceiver if this is his palace, &amp;c.,
<br/>&amp;c.; but this passes quickly away, yielding imperceptibly
<br/>to the finer emotions of her soul, until it sinks forever beneath
<br/>the power of her devoted love. This we think reconciles the
<br/>seeming inconsistencies in her character ; such, for instance
<br/>as yielding her hand to Beauseant while her heart is truly
<br/>and only Melnotte’s: for how could one of her wholesouled-
<br/>ness refuse to sacrifice herself to save the honor of the au-
<br/>thor of her being, who, to use her own sentiments—“ refus-
<br/>ed her nothing, and never spoke a harsh or unkind word.”*<span class="anchor" id="a001">

                  </span>
               </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Bland’s conception of the character was entirely na-
<br/>tural from the beginning to end. There was no straining
<br/>after effect—no points forced from their natural insignificance
<br/>to produce a momentary sensation,—all was as inartificial as
<br/>though the action were real, and she the thing she seemed.
<br/>Her interview with Claude in the third act when the fraud
<br/>is discovered, and the bitter scorn mingled with the hysteri-
<br/>cal laugh—the momentary triumph of pride over a yielding
<br/>nature, was a perfect masterpiece of art, and electrical in its
<br/>effects from its direct truthfulness. In the fourth and fifth
<br/>acts she was equally successful, carrying the audience com-
<br/>pletely with her, and inducing a unanimous and vociferous
<br/>call for her re-appearance at the fall of the curtain.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Bland has fine natural advantages—a well propor-
<br/>tioned and commanding figure—a truly intellectual face, ca-
<br/>pable of every variety of expression—a voice of rare quality,
<br/>well educated, and an easy and graceful carriage. All these
<br/>are used to admirable advantage through the perfect knowl-
<br/>edge which Mrs. Bland possesses of by-play—stage tact, &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Dyott was the Claude of the evening. It is an ardu-
<br/>ous task to undertake even an easy character, after a success-
<br/>ful and highly popular actor has made the part his own; but
<br/>in the present instance Mr. Dyott had to contend with a diffi-
<br/>cult character, and against the extraordinary impression
<br/>made by Mr. Anderson in the same role, upon the New York
<br/>public. Bearing these facts in mind, we feared for him.
<br/>The fear was, however, needless, for he acquitted himself
<br/>with much credit. He read the part, throughout, correctly,
<br/>and in many passages imparted much emphasis and passion
<br/>to his delivery. But it was evident to us that the part had
<br/>not been duly studied—the points had not been weighed and
<br/>settled in his mind—there were frequent evidences of haste
<br/>both in his action and delivery, and in speaking, the inflec-
<br/>tions of the voice so necessary to produce effective contrasts,
<br/>were but little attended to, when most they were needed.
<br/>These faults would hardly have appeared, had Mr. Dyott
<br/>been afforded more time to digest the character: such at
<br/>least is our opinion founded upon the general excellence of
<br/>his personation.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Vernon played the aristocratic and low-born woman
<br/>in her usual excellent style, excepting that in one or two
<br/>portions, especially in the third act, her manner bordered
<br/>rather upon the caricature.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bass is an admirable actor, and imparted much blunt
<br/>dignity to the character of Damas. The accident which has
<br/>deprived him, for the present, of the use of his right arm,
<br/>has also prevented a full display of his powers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fleming is a careful reader and a good actor, and if
<br/>he would impart more vigor to his manner, and strive to ap-
<br/>pear less mysterious, his style would be improved and he
<br/>would stand a fair chance of becoming a distinguished fa-
<br/>vorite.</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean appeared at the Park. They
<br/>made their debut in the Gamester. The house was crowded
<br/>to excess, and as the management does not set apart any ac-
<br/>commodation for the prominent members of the public press,
<br/>we were unwilling to endure the crowding of a thousand in-
<br/>furiated (theatrically) people ; consequently we can give no
<br/>notice of the performance. Their success was, however,
<br/>complete. Mrs. Kean was deeply affected by the cordial and
<br/>enthusiastic reception she met with. She deserves it all.</p>
                    <p>The English opera company succeed the Keans in a couple
<br/>of weeks, and the opera chosen for their appearance is the
<br/>English version of the Sonnambula. It is old—very old:
<br/>hackneyed, very hackneyed, and has become to the moderns
<br/>what the Artaxerxes of Arne was to the singers of twenty
<br/>years ago—namely, a trial opera. The system of appearing
<br/>in old operas, is, however, judicious: for if a debutante
<br/>should appear in a new, but unsuccessful work, the chances
<br/>are that the failure of one would involve the failure of both.</p>
                    <p>Miss Delcy, will, we think, become a favorite in America,
<br/>for she is young, showy and attractive in her manner, be-
<br/>sides being a singer of no ordinary merit.</p>

                    <p>The Author’s Connection with the Stage.—All I wish,
<br/>as one naturally anxious for the success and the respectabi-
<br/>lity of my own profession, is to suggest the immense advan-
<br/>tages resulting to every player from a just ambition in his<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>daily pursuit; and as one who have identified myself with
<br/>the success of the drama in our country, I feel impelled to
<br/>speak on a subject so intimately connected with its advance-
<br/>ment. Of my own attainments, I have nothing to boast.
<br/>Commencing life prematurely, like many others fascinated
<br/>by the stage in youth, the daily toils of an arduous profes-
<br/>sional life have left me little leisure for study ; and although
<br/>I had hoped to find, during the lime in which I temporarily
<br/>relinquished the stage, an auspicious opportunity of self-cul-
<br/>ture, in the pursuits of an elocutionist, the taste for the ac-
<br/>complishments of reading and speaking I found not yet suffi-
<br/>ciently diffused in the community, to furnish either the lei-
<br/>sure or the compensation requisite for the enjoyment of a
<br/>liberal scale of intellectual advantages, in connection with
<br/>that mode of life.</p>

                    <p>The Author’s Experience as an Elocutionist.—So little,
<br/>indeed, is the art of elocution yet appreciated, that, as a pro-
<br/>fession, it is still more precarious and inadequate in its remu-
<br/> merations than even the stage, which is proverbially so ; the
<br/> greatest and the most original treatise on the subject (a
<br/>work in which its author, Dr. James Rush, reflects honor on
<br/>his country,) is little read and less understood; and my own
<br/>humble attempt to render elocution a permanent branch of
<br/>education, even in the intelligent city of Boston,—although
<br/>I was aided in my endeavors by the exertions of a gentleman
<br/>long known as a practical rhetorician as well as elocutionist,
<br/>—was not sustained; nor was the expensive undertaking
<br/> countenanced, in which I endeavored to combine,—in an ap-
<br/>propriate course of education embracing ample and eligible
<br/>opportunities for the purpose,—the cultivation of the voice
<br/>with a regular system of physical exercise.*<span class="anchor" id="a002">

                    <p>The Author’s Return to the Stage.—The idea, there-
<br/>fore, of obtaining an adequate income, or of enjoying leisure
<br/>for self-culture, in such circumstances, proved impracticable.
<br/>Still, during the few years in which I withdrew from the
<br/>stage, every moment that could be seized for such purposes
<br/>I have endeavored to turn to account; and, whatever verdict
<br/>may be pronounced on my future professional efforts, I shall
<br/>never regret the results of a temporary change of pursuit,
<br/>which has enabled me to look, at least, a little more closely
<br/>into our dramatic literature, and to acquire juster views of
<br/>its depth and extent, together with a deeper and more intel-
<br/>ligent relish of its beauties.</p>
                    <p>Of one thing more I can speak distinctly, from my present
<br/>point of view: and it is in this light that I hope to be under-
<br/>stood. The more an actor devotes himself to the collateral
<br/>studies of his profession, the more clearly will he see how
<br/>high and noble are its objects, and how fully it is entitled to
<br/>the best exertions of a life, as the merited price of success in<br/>

                  <br/>its pursuit. I shall not, I think, incur the imputation of cant,
<br/>when I declare my own conviction, that acting, as the living
<br/>presentation of poetry, of sentiment, and of character, is one
<br/>of the most elevated and beneficial occupations to which a
<br/>man can devote himself. Invited by a peculiar combination
<br/>of circumstances, I have resumed the stage as my vocation,
<br/>and shall esteem myself happy to contribute the imperfect
<br/>but zealous exertions of an individual, to promote its purpo-
<br/>ses, whether within the limits of my own profession, or in
<br/>general society.</p>

                    <p>Depression or the Theatre in America.—The drama of
<br/>our own country has usually been imported; and, with its
<br/>uses, we have received its abuses.</p>
                      <p>We claim Shakspeare as our birthright, and honor him
<br/>with enthusiastic admiration ; but when our transatlantic
<br/>brethren neglect him, to follow in golden multitudes at the
<br/>heels of a French dancer, the signal is taken here. The star
<br/>of Shakspeare wanes, and the genius of Terpsichore reigns
<br/>sovereign of the ascendant.</p>
                      <p>The taste for the drama subsided for a time, while French
<br/>dancing, in all the voluptuousness of the Parisian style,
<br/>usurped its place. Giants, monsters, posture-masters, and 
<br/>the games of the circus, with other equally intellectual exhi-
<br/>bitions, have occupied the theatre; while the neglected
<br/>drama was brought to their degraded level, and made to
<br/>bear the odium of those who disgrace its name and desecrate
<br/>its temple.</p>
                      <p>That the theatre has declined within the last few years,
<br/>no one can deny; and why is this? Simply because the
<br/>age is before it. Moral reform is the order of the day; and
<br/>the enemies of the stage have attacked it upon the ground
<br/>that it encourages immorality. Portions of the theatre are
<br/>set apart for the public exhibition of the most abandoned of
<br/>the human race, while the passions are excited by the sale of
<br/>spirituous liquors. Has either of these objectionable facts
<br/>any legitimate connection with the stage or the drama ? Pub-
<br/>lic sentiment answers No! Then let these abuses be abo-
<br/>lished ! That they have been so long in existence, is no rea-
<br/>son for their continuance. No longer let the pure atmos-
<br/>phere of intellectual recreation be contaminated by grossness
<br/>and debauchery; but drive them out, to seek their congenial
<br/>sphere.</p>
                      <p>Prejudices against the theatre have been yearly gaining
<br/>ground from these causes, and many of the best friends of
<br/>the drama have been driven from the theatre. Let the ban-
<br/>ner of reform be raised, and the public will flock to the stan-
<br/>dard. Let the abuses of the theatre be removed, and the
<br/>spirit of the drama will shine forth with increased brightness.</p>
                      <p>Let men of cultivated intellect assert their right to enjoy
<br/>in its purity their favorite recreation. Let them enforce their
<br/>just claim in this respect. Let them diffuse the influence of
<br/>their own taste around them by proper appeals to general
<br/>feeling. Let all who are connected with the press, espe-
<br/>cially, discharge the duty which, in this relation, they owe
<br/>to the community, as the organs of public sentiment, and the
<br/>just guardians of its purity.</p>
                      <p>The reforms to which I allude have been attempted and
<br/>carried out, with at least temporary success, in all cases in
<br/>which due energy and perseverance have been displayed.
<br/>For my own part, I entertain no doubt that, in a short time,
<br/>the reformation will be universal and permanent. The pre-
<br/>sent is a most auspicious moment for action. We see, in all
<br/>our large cities, an incipient renovation and resuscitation of
<br/>the theatre, and the most cheering indications of its prospe-
<br/>rity. Now is the happy moment to stamp a new character 
<br/>on every department of dramatic affairs.</p>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
                      <p>The following statement evinces that the public, as well
<br/>as the manager, has a part to perform in every effectual reno-
<br/>vation of the theatre.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Macready entered upon a lease of Drury Lane theatre,
<br/>in the fall of 1841, and issued a prospectus dated October 4,
<br/>in which this passage occurs :—</p>
                      <p>The purposes to which the saloons and lobbies of London theatres
<br/>have been too frequently appropriated, have seemed to justify objec-
<br/>tions to dramatic entertainments, and have become a national reproach
<br/>among the well-informed of other countries. This cause of complaint
<br/>will not be suffered to exist in Drury Lane theatre. Arrangements
<br/>will be made and regulations enforced, not only to secure the respect-
<br/>able frequenters of the theatre from annoyance during the perform-
<br/>ance, but to restore to them an agreeable walk for promenading and
<br/>refreshment, without danger of offence to propriety or delicacy.</p>
                      <p>This was carried out to the letter. In June, 1842, a scur-
<br/>rilous article on Macready and his management, appeared in
<br/>the “ Weekly Despatch,” alleging among other things the
<br/>failure of his plan for clearing the lobbies,—that the price
<br/>admitted any well-dressed woman, of whatever character, to
<br/>the side of the respectable ladies whom Macready had drawn
<br/>into the lobbies ; in fine, that “ Mr. M. ought to be ashamed
<br/>of himself for attempting to raise money by destroying the
<br/>demarcations between the unsullied and the most polluted of
<br/>the sex.” Macready instituted a libel suit against the pro-
<br/>prietors of the paper, and the jury found for the plaintiff five
<br/>pounds damages.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Macready closed his management of Drury Lane in
<br/>June, 1843. In his concluding address, he makes no mention
<br/>of his reform of the lobbies—unless it is implied in this de-
<br/>claration :</p>
                      <p>In conclusion let me merely add, that I have endeavored to re-
<br/>deem, throughout my management, every pledge of my introductory
<br/>address.</p>
                      <p>The admission of improper persons at theatres, as at other
<br/>places of public resort, would, if the proposed arrangement
<br/>were adopted, be left to the responsibility of the gentleman
<br/>who accompanied any female, and by that fact endorsed her
<br/>respectability.</p>

<br/>A new spectacle, however, is in preparation.</p>
                      <p>We stepped in at The Chatham on Monday night to see
<br/>Booth in Pescara and Jerry Sneak. How The Apostate
<br/>maintains its place on the stage, is inconceivable. It has not
<br/>a single redeeming feature—at least if the Chatham Street
<br/>representation of it is a fair one. Mr. Booth did not impress
<br/>us at all—except in the distinctness of his enunciation and
<br/>his general ease and freedom from rant. He has a sad man-
<br/>nerism—that of putting his hands to his ears upon all occa-
<br/>sions. His Jerry Sneak is a pitiable spectacle.</p>

<br/>Honoria his wife, upon Mount Celion, directing the Shepherds
<br/>who are employed in opening the mouth of the Cave of the 
<br/>Seven Sleepers. While thus engaged Antipater relates
<br/>the persecution of the brothers, and of Anicianus who was
<br/>his (Antipater’s) ancestor. When the work is finished the
<br/>characters go out, to join at Ephesus the grand procession of
<br/>Priests and Warriors appointed to proceed to the Cave, to
<br/>disinter the Martyrs’ bones and carry them in honor to the
<br/>city.</p>
                       <p>When the Cave is opened, a slow chorale is heard and one
<br/>by one the Brothers come from within. Like Rip Van
<br/>Winkle they awoke unconscious of the lapse of years—two
<br/>centuries appearing unto them, but as the passage of a sin-
<br/>gle night. They return thanks to heaven for their wonderful
<br/>preservation from the persecuting Decius. Malchus the
<br/>youngest brother, offers to go to the city, in order to procure
<br/>food. He arrives there just as the High Priest is blessing the
<br/>Standards of the Warriors who are going forth to fight the
<br/>Persians. He stares around him in wild amazement at the
<br/>altered appearance of the city—the strange dresses attract
<br/>his eye—the language seems new to him, and the emblems
<br/>of the cross on every side, overwhelm him with astonish-
<br/>ment. The people mistake him for a Persian Spy, and
<br/>watch him. He enters a baker’s shop and offers a gold solidus
<br/>for bread. This confirms them in their suspicions and they
<br/>seize him and bear him before Antipater. His simple tale
<br/>is quickly told, and bears so much the stamp of truth that
<br/>the Proconsul believes it, and the people rush with feverish
<br/>impatience to behold the wonder on Mount Celion. They
<br/>arrive and do honor to the Saints whom heaven has so mira-
<br/>culously preserved through ages of time. Honoria entreats
<br/>them to leave the Cave and revisit their home in Ephesus;
<br/>but Johannes thus replies;—</p>
                       
               <div class="lg">
                  <br/>God be with you ; but we are not permitted
<br/>To return and tread our halls again ;
<br/>Here is our repose, in holy quiet,
<br/>Till the dead are summoned from their graves.
<br/>For the Lord's good spirit has revealed it;—
<br/>As an emblem are we sent to you,
<br/>Of that morning, when, by him awakened,
<br/>All our race from darksome graves shall rise.</div>
                       
                        <p>Sleep again appears to be stealing over the senses of the
<br/>Seven Brothers—they utter with one voice</p>

               <div class="lg">
                  <br/>Now with strokes of unseen wings, approaching
<br/>Sleep is fanning us yet once again.</div>
                       
                        <p>They fall asleep, and are borne into the Sacred Cavern, by
<br/>the awe-stricken and wondering people.</p>
                        <p>Such is the plot of the Oratorio; a finer subject could
<br/>scarcely have been selected. It is full of deep and thrilling
<br/>interest, and abounds with highly wrought dramatic situa-
<br/>tion. The Music is of a high character; it displays many
<br/>passages which could scarcely be excelled. It is melodious,
<br/>partaking in a large degree of the exquisite peculiarities of
<br/>Haydn’s school—Dr. Loewe being, we believe, a pupil of
<br/>that great Master.</p>
                       <p>We have not a doubt of the popularity of the Seven
<br/>Sleepers, for the subject affords ample scope for striking<br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>contrasts, and the Composer has availed himself of these ad-
<br/>vantages to their uttermost limits.</p>
                       <p>We have not, as yet, seen an announcement of the names
<br/>of the principal performers; we shall probably receive them
<br/>for our next number. The chorus will number over one
<br/>hundred and twenty-five efficient members; the band will
<br/>be numerous and carefully selected. Mr. George Loder will
<br/>conduct the whole, and Mr. H. C. Timm will be at the
<br/>Organ.</p>
                       <p>We trust that our readers in the city will support, with all
<br/>their interest, this praise-worthy attempt to produce a fine
<br/> Composition, upon a scale of excellence hitherto unattained
<br/>in this country.</p>

                    <p>The French Opera at Niblo’s continues to be highly suc-
<br/>cessful. Nothing new has, as yet, been produced ; but Ma-
<br/>niello and Les Huguenots continue to prove sufficient to
<br/>attract crowded audiences. Several novelties are in prepar-
<br/>ation. Among others La Reine de Cypre is in a forward
<br/>state of preparation.</p>
                    <p>We are strong in the hope that the Manager, Mr. Davis,
<br/>will find it for his interest to remain with us during the
<br/>winter months. We feel certain that he would meet with
<br/>support altogether beyond his expectations, if he bases them
<br/>upon the result of the recent season at the Park Theatre.
<br/>The intelligence of New York requires such an establish-
<br/>ment, and the musical taste is sufficiently influential and ex-
<br/>tended to support it amply. The present company has gain-
<br/>ed the respect of every one. The public is not pestered, an-
<br/>noyed and disgusted by petty bickerings, grand quarrels,
<br/>newspaper warfare, as in the case of the last Italian com-
<br/>pany at Palmo’s; but on the contrary everything is peace-
<br/>ful, well arranged—in short it is a family party showing
<br/>only its amiable and attractive side to the public.</p>
                    <p>If it were known that Mr. Davis could remain here with
<br/>his company during the winter, there would be no lack of
<br/>the right class of people to ensure his success. We want
<br/>to hear Gustclave, Lestocq, La Lac des Fees, Zampa, Pre aux
<br/>Clercs, L’Edair, and other charming French works, and we
<br/>look to the company at present here as the only means of
<br/>gaining our wish.</p>

                    <p>Advertisements, this week, have trenched rather more
<br/>than we could wish upon our space for literary matter. For

                    <p>Bolles’ Phonographic Dictionary has “controvertible”
<br/>and not—“ controvertibility”—“ self-conceited” and not “ self-
<br/>conceitedly"—“worldly-minded ” and not “worldly-minded-
<br/>ly.” Are these omissions intentional ? We presume not.
<br/>Some of its definitions are inaccurate, if not odd—whether
<br/>these are adopted from other works, we have not leisure to
<br/>ascertain. For example; “jealousy” is defined as “suspi-
<br/>cion in love”—but is it not rather the passion aroused by sus-
<br/>picion in love? “Museum” is defined “a collection of
<br/>learned curiosities”—but neither Tom Thumb, nor the Ana-
<br/>conda are particularly “learned.” A printer is said to be
<br/>“one who prints books;” then one who merely prints hand-
<br/>bills is no printer at all. A regicide is described as a “ n-ur-
<br/>derer of one's king”—and yet the murderer of anybody’s king
<br/> is still a regicide.</p>

                      <p>The Rev. Arthur Coxe’s Saul, a Mystery, having been condemned
<br/>in no measured terms by Poe of the Broadway Journal, and Green of
<br/>the Emporium, a writer in the Hartford Columbian retorts as follows,
<br/>which strikes us as being very clever:</p>
                      A REVERSAL.
<div class="lg">
                  <br/>An entertaining history
<br/>Entitled “ Saul a mystery,”
<br/>Has recently been published by the Rev. Arthur Coxe.
<br/>The poem is dramatic,
<br/>And the wit of it is attic,
<br/>And its teachings are emphatic of the doctrines orthodox.
<br/>But Mr. Poe, the poet,
<br/>Declares he cannot go it—
<br/>That the book is very stupid—or something of that sort:
<br/>And Green of the Empori
<br/>Um, tells a kindred story,
<br/>And “ swears like any tory” that it isn’t worth a groat.
<br/>But maugre all their croaking,
<br/>Of the “ raven”—and the joking
<br/>Of the verdant little fellow of the used to be review,
<br/>The People, in derision
<br/>Of their impudent decision,
<br/>Have declared without division, that the“ Mystery will do.”</div>
                       <p>The truth, of course, rather injures an epigram than other-
<br/>wise ; and nobody will think the worse of the one above
<br/>when we say that we have expressed no opinion whatever
<br/>of “ Saul.” Give a dog a bad name, &amp;c. Whenever a book
<br/>is abused, it is taken for granted that it is we who have been
<br/>abusing it. Mr. Coxe has written some very beautiful po-
<br/>ems, and “Saul” may be one of them for anything that we
<br/>know to the contrary. As yet we have not found time to
<br/>read the poem —which, to say the truth, is an unconscionably
<br/>long one.</p>

                  <p>Ollendorff’s New Method of Learning to Read, Write, and
<br/>Speak the German language, has had an extensive circula-

<br/>stantly been increasing of late. Nor is its popularity unde-
<br/>served : for it supplies a deficiency which has been long and
<br/>deeply felt by all those who have engaged in either teaching
<br/>or learning the German. Though the richness, flexibility and
<br/>beauty of the language itself have fully sustained its claim of
<br/>superiority, and though the numberless works in Philology,
<br/>History, Physics, Chemistry, and in every possible depart-
<br/>ment of Science and Art, with which Germany is constantly
<br/>teeming, have long since made the knowledge of the lan
<br/>guage an indispensable accomplishment of every scholar, yet
<br/>it is strange to say that the want of the necessity facilities
<br/>has chilled the ardor of many in their attempt of acquiring it.

            <div class="ab">THIS DAY IS PUBLISHED,
<br/>VERSE AND PROSE, by Thomas Hood—Part 1,
<br/>forming No. 16 of the Library or Choice Reading, beautifully
<br/>printed Price 50 cents.
<br/>“ Of all the humorists, Hood was the most poetical. When deal-
<br/>ing with the most familiar subjects, whether it might be a sweep be-
<br/>wailing the suppression of his cry, or a mother searching through St.
<br/>Giles’s for her lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg’s golden childhood—
<br/>there was hardly a verse in which some touches of heart, or some play
<br/>of fancy, did not beckon the laughing reader away into far other
<br/>worlds than the jester’s.”—London Athenaum.
<br/>“ The smile and the sigh were ever blended together: the laugh at
<br/>the grotesque idea and whimsical imagination, (rarely seeing objects
<br/>as others saw them,) and the tear which must now on such pathetic
<br/>narratives as Eugene Aram or the Old Elm Tree. Without a parallel
<br/>and original as Hood was in the ludicrous, his more enduring fame
<br/>will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassionate.”—Lite-
<br/>rary Gazette.
<br/>“ He was the inventer of a new sort of guano to fertilize men’s
<br/>minds, and to make them produce larger crops of good actions: or rath-
<br/>er it was an intellectual compost that he invented, and the materials
<br/>of which were satire softened by kindness, and ridicule tempered with 
<br/>good feeling.”—Hood's Magazine for June. Published and for sale

<br/>MANUFACTURERS OP THE
<br/>IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
<br/>By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard,
<br/>J.F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for
<br/>the manufacture and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
<br/>281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
<br/>His arrangements are snch as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties imposed by
<br/>Tariff on these Instruments.
<br/>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of London and
<br/>Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken to fit them for the ex-
<br/>tremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufacture, imported in the usual way.
<br/>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention N. C Bochsa,
<br/>who invariably selects from this establishment.
<br/>J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
<br/>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of testing
<br/>their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof against the in-
<br/>constancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction. I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT,
<br/>January, 1845.	No. 40 Beach Street, N. Y.
<br/>Dear Sir :—I write to exrress the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city. The
<br/>mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old Master,
<br/>Bochsa, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other.	Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.
<br/>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844?
<br/>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society Concert,
<br/>is, in brilliancy of tone, touch and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps. The Grand six
<br/>and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument.	Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
<br/>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Bochsa.
<br/>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps. I find they possess the best qualities of the
<br/>first Makers in Europe combined. That the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, the perfection and ease of modulation,
<br/>they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new Grand Gothic six and a half oc-
<br/>tavo, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure in recommending our Harps at every
<br/>opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.
<br/>January 12th, 1854.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
<br/>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of making a
<br/>correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid improvements in
<br/>this delightful Instrument.

<br/>OPINION OF JARED SPARKS, ESQ.
<br/>" With the Florentine Histones, I am well acquainted. Formed on
<br/>the classical models of antiquity, it is executed with consummate skill,
<br/>few historital compositions are so successful in attaining the two great
<br/>ends of entertainment and instruction. The style is spirited, clear
<br/>and vigorous, the narrative rapid and condensed, the reflections of the
<br/>author, though brief and sententious, are always appropriate and often
<br/>profound. .....	.
<br/>There is probably no work within the same compass in which the
<br/>instructive lessons of History can be studied with more profit and ef-
<br/>fect.”</div>

      <p>* The above topics I cannot pass without an expression of acknow-
            <br/>ledgment to two individuals:—Mr. William Russell, the rhetorician
            <br/>above referred to, for invaluable aid in my course of personal study
            <br/>with him—and Mr. N. Houghton, whose regard for subjects beyond
            <br/>the mere range of mercantile life, and whose liberal and philanthropic
            <br/>spirit, enabled me to offer to the citizens of Boston the opportunity of
            <br/>a superior establishment for physical and elocutionary education. Mr.
            <br/>H.’s interest in these subjects, and others of a kindred nature, has, in
            <br/>this, as in many other instances, evinced the benefits resulting to a
            <br/> community from the generous spirit of individuals in private life, who
            <br/>contribute the most effectual of all aids to the mental welfare of their
            <br/>fellow-citizens, by imparting the requisite means of establishing and
            <br/>maintaining institutions devoted to the culture and improvement of
            <br/> humanity.</p>

              <br/>ment of physical education, I feel under peculiar obligations, as well
              <br/>as to Mr. Abbott Lawrence, Mr. George S. Hillard, Mr. Peleg W.
              <br/>Chandler, and other individuals, who, as parents, or as patrons of in-
              <br/> tellectual objects, exerted themselves on behalf of my purposes. I
              <br/>cannot but hope that it may fall to some other person than myself to
