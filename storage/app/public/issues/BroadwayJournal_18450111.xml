            THE DRAMA OR EXILE, AND OTHER POEMS : By Elizabeth Barrett
            Barrett, Author of “ The Seraphim,” and other Poems. New York:

         </p>
         <p>MISS BARRETT has need only of real self-interest in her
            subjects, to do justice to her subjects and to herself. On the
            other hand, “A Rhapsody of Life’s Progress,” although
            gleaming with cold corruscations, is the least meritorious,
            because the most philosophical, effusion of the whole:—this,
            we say, in flat contradiction of the “ spoudiotalon kai philosophikotaton genos" of Aristotle. “ The Cry of the Human”
            is singularly effective, not more from the vigour and ghastly passion of its thought, than from the artistically-conceived arabesquerie of its rhythm. “ The Cry of the Children,” similar, although superior in tone and handling, is
            full of a nervous unflinching energy—a horror sublime
            in its simplicity—of which a far greater than Dante might
            have been proud.	“ Bertha in the Lane,” a rich bal-
         </p>

         <p>lad, very singularly excepted from the wholesale commendation of the “Democratic Review,” as “perhaps not one of
            the best," and designated by Blackwood, on the contrary, as
            “ decidedly the finest poem of the collection,” is not the very
            best, we think, only because mere pathos, however exquisite,
            cannot be ranked with the loftiest exhibitions of the ideal.
            Of “ Lady Geraldine’s Courtship,” the magazine last quoted
            observes that “ some pith is put forth in its passionate parts.”
            We will not pause to examine the delicacy or lucidity of the
            metaphor embraced in the “ putting forth of some pith but
            unless by “ some pith” itself, is intended the utmost conceivable intensity and vigour, then the critic is merely damning with faint praise. With the exception of Tennyson’s
            “ Locksley Hall,” we have never perused a poem combining
            so much of the fiercest passion with so much of the most
            ethereal fancy, as the “ Lady Geraldine’s Courtship,” of Miss
            Barrett. We are forced to admit, however, that the latter
            work is a very palpable imitation of the former, which it
            surpasses in plot or rather in thesis, as much as it falls below
            it in artistical management, and a certain calm energy—lustrous and indomitable—such as we might imagine in abroad
            river of molten gold.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It is in the “ Lady Geraldine” that the critic of Blackwood
            is again put at fault in the comprehension of a couple of passages. He confesses his inability “to make out the construction of the words, ‘ all that spirits pure and ardent are
            cast out of love and reverence, because chancing not to
            hold.’” There are comparatively few American school-boys
            who could not parse it. The prosaic construction would run
            thus:—“all that (wealth understood) because chancing not
            to hold which, (or on account of not holding which) all pure
            and ardent spirits are cast out of love and reverence.” The
            “ which” is involved in the relative pronoun “ that”—the
            second word of the sentence. All that we know is, that Miss
            Barrett is right:—here is a parallel phrase, meaning—“ all
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>that (which) we know,” etc. The fact is, that the accusation of imperfect grammar would have been more safely, if
            more generally, urged: in descending to particular exceptions,
            the reviewer has been doing little more than exposing himself at all points.
         </p>
         <p>Turning aside, however, from grammar, he declares his
            incapacity to fathom the meaning of
            She has halls and she has castles, and the resonant steam-eagles
            Follow far on the directing of her floating dove-like hand—
            With a thunderous vapour trailing underneath the starry vigils,
            So to mark upon the blasted heaven the measure of her land.
            
         </p>
         <p>Now it must be understood that he is profoundly serious in
            his declaration—he really does not apprehend the thought
            designed—and he is even more than profoundly serious, too,
            in intending these his own comments upon his own stolidity,
            for wit:—“ We thought that steam-coaches generally followed the directing of no hand except the stoker’s, but it, certainly, is always much liker a raven than a dove.” After this,
            who shall question the infallibility of Christopher North?
            We presume there are very few of our readers who will not
            easily appreciate the richly imaginative conception of the
            poetess:—The Lady Geraldine is supposed to be standing in
            her own door, (positively not on the top of an engine), and
            thence pointing, “ with her floating dove-like hand,” to the
            lines of vapour, from the “resonant steam-eagles,” that designate upon the “ blasted heaven,” the remote boundaries of
            her domain.—But, perhaps, we are guilty of a very gross absurdity ourselves, in commenting at all upon the whimsicalities of a reviewer who can deliberately select for special animadversion the second of the four verses we here copy:
         </p>
         <p>“ Eyes, he said, now throbbing through me! are ye eyes that did undo me ?
            Shining eyes like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone!
            Underneath that calm white forehead are ye ever burning torrid
            O’er the desolate sand desert of my heart and life undone?”
            
         </p>
         <p>The ghost of the Great Frederic might, to be sure, quote
            at us, in his own Latin, his favorite adage, “De gustibus
            non est disputandus;”—but, when we take into consideration
            the moral designed, the weirdness of effect intended, and
            the historical adaptation of the fact alluded to, in the line
            italicized, (a fact of which it is by no means impossible that
            the critic is ignorant), we cannot refrain from expressing our
            conviction—and we here express it in the teeth of the whole
            horde of the Ambrosianians—that from the entire range of
            poetical literature there shall not, in a century, be produced
            a more sonorous—a more vigorous verse—a juster—a nobler
            —a more ideal—a more magnificent image—than this very
            image, in this very verse, which the most noted magazine of
            Europe has so especially and so contemptuously condemned.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ The Lady Geraldine” is, we think, the only poem of its
            author which is not deficient, considered as an artistical
            whole. Her constructive ability, as we have already suggested, is either not very remarkable, or has never been properly brought into play :—in truth, her genius is too impetuous for the minuter technicalities of that elaborate Art so
            needful in the building up of pyramids for immortality.
            This deficiency, then—if there be any such—is her chief
            weakness. Her other foibles, although some of them are, in
            fact, glaring, glare, nevertheless, to no very material ill purpose. There are none which she will not readily dismis
         </p>
         <p>
            in her future works. She retains them now, perhaps, be-
            cause unaware of their existence.
            
         </p>
         <p>Her affectations are unquestionably many, and generally
            inexcusable. We may, perhaps, tolerate such words as
            “ ble,” “ chrysm,” “ nympholeptic,” “ oenomel,” and “ chrysopras”—they have at least the merit either of distinct meaning, or of terse and sonorous expression ;—but what can be
            well said in defence of the unnecessary nonsense of “ ’ware”
            for “ aware”—of “ ’bide,” for “ abide”—of “ ’gins,” for “ begins”—of “ ’las,” for “ alas”—of “ oftly,” “ often,” and “ oftest,” for “ often,” “ more often,” and “ most often”—or of
            “erelong” in the sense of “long ago”? That there is authority for the mere words proves nothing; those who employed them in their day would not employ them if writing
            now. Although we grant, too, that the poetess is very usually Homeric in her compounds, there is no intelligibility of
            construction, and therefore no force of meaning in “ dew-pallid,” “ pale-passioned,” and “ silver-solemn.” Neither have
            we any partiality for “drave” or “supreme,” or “ lament”; and
            while upon this topic, we may as well observe that there
            are few readers who do anything but laugh or stare, at such
            phrases as “ L. E. L.’s Last Questio”—“ The Cry of the Human”—“Leaning from my Human”—“Heaven assist the
            human”—“ the full sense of your mortal”—“ a grave for your
            divine”—“ falling off from our created”—“ he sends this gage
            for thy pity’s counting”—“ they could not press their futures
            on the present of her courtesy”—or “ could another fairer
            lack to thee, lack to thee ?” There are few, at the same
            time, who do not feel disposed to weep outright, when they
            hear of such things as “ Hope withdrawing her peradventure”—“ spirits dealing in pathos of antithesis”—“ angels in
            antagonism to God and his reflex beatitudes”—“ songs of
            glories ruffling down doorways”—“God’s possibles”—and
            “ rules of Mandom.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We have already said, however, that mere quaintness within reasonable limit, is not only not to be regarded as affectation, but has its proper artistic uses in aiding a fantastic effect. We quote, from the lines “To my dog Flush,” a
            passage in exemplification :
         </p>
         <p>Leap! thy broad tail waves a light!
            Leap! thy slender feet are bright,
            
         </p>
         <p>Canopied in fringes !
            Leap! those tasselled ears of thine
            Flicker strangely, fair and fine,
         </p>
         <p>Down their golden inches !
            And again—from the song of a tree-spirit, in the “ Drama
            of Exile
            
         </p>
         <p>The Divine impulsion cleaves
            In dim movements to the leaves
            Dropt and lifted, dropt and lifted,
         </p>
         <p>In the sun-light greenly sifted,—
            In the sun-light and the moon-light
            Greenly sifted through the trees.
            Ever wave the Eden trees,
            In the night-light and the noon-light,
            With a ruffling of green branches,
            Shaded off to resonances,
            Never stirred by rain or breeze.
            
         </p>
         <p>The thoughts, here, belong to the highest order of poetry,
            but they could not have been wrought into effective expression, without the instrumentality of those repetitions—those
            unusual phrases—in a word, those quaintnesses, which it
            has been too long the fashion to censure, indiscriminately,
            under the one general head of “ affectation.” No true poet
            will fail to be enraptured with the two extracts above quoted—but we believe there are few who would not find a
            difficulty in reconciling the psychal impossibility of refraining from admiration, with the too-hastily attained mental
            conviction that, critically, there is nothing to admire.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Occasionally, we meet in Miss Barrett’s poems a certain
            far-fetchedness of imagery, which is reprehensible in the
            extreme. What, for example, are we to think of
         </p>
         <p>Now he hears the angel voices
            Folding silence in the room?—
            undoubtedly, that it is nonsense, and no more; or of
            How the silence round you shivers
            While our voices through it go?—
            again, unquestionably, that it is nonsense, and nothing
            beyond.
            
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes we are startled by knotty paradoxes; and it is
            not acquitting their perpetrator of all blame on their account
            to admit that, in some instances, they are susceptible of
         </p>
         <p>solution. It is really difficult to discover anything for appro-
            -bation, in enigmas such as
            That bright impassive, passive angel-hood,
            or—
            The silence of my heart is full of sound.
            At long intervals, we are annoyed by specimens of repul-
            sive imagery, as where the children cry ;
            How long, O cruel nation,
            Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart—
            Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation? etc.
            Now and then, too, we are confounded by a pure plati-
            tude, as when Eve exclaims:
            Leave us not
            In agony beyond what we can bear,
            And in abasement below thunder mark!
            or, when the Saviour is made to say:
            So, at last,
            He shall look round on you with lids too straight
            To hold the grateful tears.
            
         </p>
         <p>“ Strait” was, no doubt, intended, but does not materially
            elevate, although it slightly elucidates, the thought. A very
            remarkable passage is that, also, wherein Eve bids the infant
            voices
         </p>
         <p>Hear the steep generations, how they fall
            Adown the visionary stairs of Time,
            Like supernatural thunders—far yet near,
            Sowing their fiery echoes through the hills!
            
         </p>
         <p>Here, saying nothing of the affectation in “adown;” not
            alluding to the insoluble paradox of “ far yet near;" not
            mentioning the inconsistent metaphor involved in the “ sowing of fiery echoes;" adverting but slightly to the misusage
            of “ like,” in place of “ as,” and to the impropriety of mak-ing any thing fall like thunder, which has never been known
            to fall at all; merely hinting, too, at the misapplication of
            “ steep,” to the “ generations,” instead of to the “ stairs”—
            a perversion in no degree to be justified by the fact that so
            preposterous a figure as synecdoche exists in the school
            books;—letting these things pass, for the present, we shall
            still find it difficult to understand how Miss Barrett should
            have been led to think the principal idea itself—the abstract
            idea—the idea of tumbling down stairs in any shape, or
            under any circumstances,—either a poetical or a decorous
            conception. And yet we have seen this very passage quoted
            as “ sublime,” by a critic who seems to take it for granted,
            as a general rule, that Nat-Leeism is the loftiest order of
            literary merit. That the lines very narrowly missed sublimity, we grant; that they came within a step of it, we
            admit;—but, unhappily, the step is that one step which,
            time out of mind, has intervened between the sublime and
            the ridiculous. So true is this, that any person—that even
            we—with a very partial modification of the imagery—a modification that shall not interfere with its richly spiritual tone
            —may elevate the quotation into unexceptionability. For
            example: and we offer it with profound deference —
         </p>
         <p>Hear the far generations—how they crash,
            From crag to crag, down the precipitous Time,
            In multitudinous thunders that upstartle,
            Aghast, the echoes from their cavernous lairs
            In the visionary hills !
            
         </p>
         <p>We have no doubt that our version has its faults—but it
            has, at least, the merit of consistency. Not only is a mountain more poetical than a pair of stairs; but echoes are
            more appropriately typified as wild beasts than as seeds;
            and echoes and wild beasts agree better with a mountain
            than does a pair of stairs with the sowing of seeds—even
            admitting that these seeds be seeds of fire, and be sown
            broadcast “ among the hills,” by a steep generation while
            in the act of tumbling down the stairs—that is to say, of
            coming down the stairs in too violent a hurry to be capable
            of sowing the seeds as accurately as all seeds should be
            sown ; nor is the matter rendered any better for Miss Barrett, even if the construction of her sentence is to be understood as implying that the fiery seeds were sown, not immediately by the steep generations that stumbled down the
            stairs, but mediately, through the intervention of the “ super-natural thunders” that were occasioned by the “ steep gen-erations” that tumbled down the stairs.
         </p>
         <p>The poetess is not unfrequently guilty of repeating herself.
            
            
         </p>
         <p>The “ thunder cloud veined by lightning” appears, for in- stance, on pages 34 of the
            first, and 228 of the second volume. The “silver clash of wings” is heard at pages 53 of
            the first, and 269 of the second ; and angel tears are discovered to be falling as well at page 27, as at the conclusion of
            “ The Drama of Exile.” Steam, too, in the shape of Death’s
            White Horse, comes upon the ground, both at page 244 of the
            first and 179 of the second volume—and there are multitudinous other repetitions both of phrase and idea—but it is the
            excessive reiteration of pet words which is, perhaps, the most
            obtrusive of the minor errors of the poet. “ Chrystalline,”
            “ Apocalypse,” “ foregone,” “ evangel,” “ ’ware,” “ throb,”
            “ level,” “ loss,” and the musical term “ minor,” are forever
            upon her lips. The chief favorites, however, are “ down”
            and “ leaning,” which are echoed and re-echoed not only ad infinitum, but in every
            whimsical variation of import. As Miss Barrett certainly cannot be aware of the extent
            of this mannerism, we will venture to call her attention to a few—
            comparatively a very few examples.
         </p>
         <p>Pealing down the depths of Godhead—
            And smiling down the stars—
            Smiling down, as Venus down the waves—
            Smiling down the steep world'very purely—
            Down the purple of this chamber—
            Moving down the hidden depths of loving—
            Cold the sun shines down the door—
            Which brought angels down our talk—
            Let your souls behind you lean gently moved —
            But angels leaning from the golden seats—
            And melancholy leaning out of heaven—
            And I know the heavens are leaning down—
            Then over the casement she leaneth—
            Forbear that dream, too near to heaven if leaned—
            I would lean my spirit o’er you—
            Thou, O sapient angel, leanest o'er—
            Shapes of brightness overlean thee—
            They are leaning their young heads—
            Out of heaven shall o’er you lean—
            While my spirit leans and reaches—
            Leaning from my human—
            When it leans out on the air—
            etc. etc. etc.
            
         </p>
         <p>In the matter of grammar, upon which the Edinburgh
            critic insists so pertinaciously, the author of “ The Drama of
            Exile” seems to us even peculiarly without fault. The nature of her studies has, no doubt, imbued her with a very
            delicate instinct of constructive accuracy. The occasional
            use of phrases so questionable as “from whence” and the
            far-fetchedness and involution of which we have already spoken, are the only noticeable
            blemishes of an exceedingly
            chaste, vigorous and comprehensive style.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In her inattention to rhythm, Mrs. Barrett is guilty of an
            error that might have been fatal to her fame—that would
            have been fatal to any reputation less solidly founded than
            her own. We do not allude, so particularly, to her multiplicity of inadmissible rhymes. We would wish, to be sure,
            that she had not thought proper to couple Eden and succeeding—glories and floorwise—burning and morning—thither
            and tether—enclose me and across me—inisdoers and flow-ers—centre and winter—guerdon and pardon—conquer and
            anchor—desert and unmeasured—atoms and fathoms—opal
            and people—glory and doorway—trumpet and accompted—
            taming and overcame him—coming and woman—is and trees
            —off and sun-proof—eagles and vigils—nature and satire
            —poems and interflowings—certes and virtues—pardon
            and burden—thereat and great—children and bewildering—
            mortal and turtle—moonshine and'sunshine. It would have
            been better, we say, if such apologies for rhymes as these
            had been rejected. But deficiencies of rhythm are more seri-ous. In some cases it is nearly impossible to determine
            what metre is intended. “ The Cry of the Children” cannot
            be scanned: we never saw so poor a specimen of verse. In
            imitating the rhythm of “ Locksley Hall,” the poetess has
            preserved with accuracy (so far as mere syllables are concerned) the forcible line of seven trochees with a final caesura.
            The “double rhymes" have only the force of a single long syllable—a caesura; but the natural rhythmical division, occur-ring at the close of the fourth trochee, should never be forced to occur, as Miss
            Barrett constantly forces it, in the middle of
            a word, or of an indivisible phrase. If it do so occur, we must sacrifice, in perusal,
            either the sense or the rhythm. If she
            will consider, too, that this line of seven trochees and a
            caesura, is nothing more than two lines written in one—a
            line of four trochees, succeeded by one of three trochees and
            a caesura—she will at once see how unwise she has been in
            composing her poem in quatrains of the long line with alter-nate rhymes, instead of
            immediate ones, as in the case of
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Locksley Hall.” The result is, that the ear, expecting the
            rhymes before they occur, does not appreciate them when
            they do. These points, however, will be best exemplified
            by transcribing one of the quatrains in its natural arrangement. That actually employed is addressed only to the eye.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Oh, she fluttered like a tame bird
            In among its forest brothers
            Far too strong for it, then, drooping,
         </p>
         <p>Bowed her face upon her hands—
            And I spake out wildly, fiercely,
            Brutal truths of her and others !
            I, she planted in the desert,
            Swathed her ’wind-like, with my sands.
            
         </p>
         <p>Here it will be seen that there is a paucity of rhyme, and
            that it is expected at closes where it does not occur. In fact,
            if we consider the eight lines as two independent quatrains,
            (which they are), then we find them entirely rhymeless.
            Now so unhappy are these metrical defects—of so much importance do we take them to be, that we do not hesitate
            in declaring the general inferiority of the poem to its prototype to be altogether chargeable to them. With equal rhythm
            “ Lady Geraldine” had been far—very far the superior poem.
            Inefficient rhythm is inefficient poetical expression; and expression, in poetry,—what is it ?—what is it not ? No one
            living can better answer these queries than Miss Barrett.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We conclude our comments upon her versification, by quoting (we will not say whence—from what one of her poems)
            —a few verses without the linear division as it appears in
            the book. There are many readers who would never suspect the passage to be intended for metre at all.—“ Ay !—
            and sometimes, on the hill-side, while we sat down on the
            gowans, with the forest green behind us, and its shadow cast
            before, and the river running under, and, across it from the
            rowens a partridge whirring near us till we felt the air it
            bore—there, obedient to her praying, did I read aloud the
            poems made by Tuscan flutes, or instruments more various
            of our own—read the pastoral parts of Spenser—or the subtle interflowings found in Petrarch’s sonnets;—here’s the
            book !—the leaf is folded down!”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>With this extract we make an end of our fault-finding—
            and now, shall we speak, equally in detail, of the beauties of
            this book ? Alas ! here, indeed, do we feel the impotence of
            the pen. We have already said that the supreme excellence of the poetess whose works we review, is made up of the
            multitudinous sums of a world of lofty merits. It is the multiplicity—it is the aggregation—which excites our most profound enthusiasm, and enforces our most earnest respect.
            But unless we had space to extract three fourths of the volumes, how could we convey this aggregation by specimens ?
            We might quote, to be sure, an example of keen insight into our psychal nature, such as this:
         </p>
         <p>I fell flooded with a Dark,
            In the silence of a swoon—
            When I rose, still cold and stark,
            There was night,—I saw the moon :
            And the stars, each in its place,
            And the May-blooms on the grass,
            Seemed to wonder what I was.
            And I walked as if apart
            From myself when I could stand—
            And I pitied my own heart,
            
         </p>
         <p>As if I held it in my hand
            Somewhat coldly,—with a sense
            Of fulfilled benevolence.
         </p>
         <p>Or we might copy an instance of the purest and most radi-
            -ant imagination, such as this :
            So, young muser, I sat listening
            To my Fancy’s wildest word—
            On a sudden, through the glistening
            Leaves around, a little stirred,
            Came a sound, a sense of music, which was rather felt than heard.
            Softly, finely, it inwound me—
            From the world it shut me in—
            Like a fountain falling round me
            Which with silver waters thin,
            Holds a little marble Naiad sitting smilingly within.
            
         </p>
         <p>Or, again, we might extract a specimen of wild Dantesque
            vigor, such as this—in combination with a pathos never ex-celled :
         </p>
         <p>Ay! be silent—let them hear each other breathing
            For a moment, mouth to mouth—
            Let them touch each others’ hands in a fresh wreathing
            Of their tender human youth !
            Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
            Is not all the life God fashions or reveals—
            Let them prove their inward souls against the notion
            That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
            Or, still again, we might give a passage embodying the
            
            most elevated sentiment, most tersely and musically thus ex-
            pressed :
            And since, Prince Albert, men have called thy spirit high and rare,
            And true to truth, and brave for truth, as some at Augsburg were—
            We charge thee by thy lofty thoughts and by thy poet-mind,
            Which not by glory or degree takes measure of mankind,
            Esteem that wedded hand less dear for sceptre than for ring,
            And hold her uncrowned womanhood to be the royal thing!
            
         </p>
         <p>These passages, we say, and a hundred similar ones, exemplifying particular excellences, might be displayed, and
            we should still fail, as lamentably as the skolastikos with his
            brick, in conveying an idea of the vast totality. By no individual stars can we present the constellatory radiance of the
            book.—To the book, then, with implicit confidence we appeal.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>That Miss Barrett has done more, in poetry, than any woman, living or dead, will scarcely be questioned:—that she
            has surpassed all her poetical contemporaries of either sex
            (with a single exception) is our deliberate opinion—not idly
            entertained, we think, nor founded on any visionary basis. It
            may not be uninteresting, therefore, in closing this examination of her claims, to determine in what manner she holds
            poetical relation with these contemporaries, or with her immediate predecessors, and especially with the great exception to which we have alluded,—if at all.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If ever mortal “ wreaked his thoughts upon expression” it
            was Shelley. If ever poet sang (as a bird sings)—impulsively
            —earnestly—with utter abandonment—to himself solely—
            and for the mere joy of his own song—that poet was the author of the Sensitive Plant. Of Art—beyond that which is
            the inalienable instinct of Genius—he either had little or disdained all. He really disdained that Rule which is the emation from Law, because his own soul was law in itself. His
            rhapsodies are but the rough notes—the stenographic memoranda of poems—memoranda which, because they were allsufficient for his own intelligence, he cared not to be at the
            trouble of transcribing in full for mankind. In his whole life
            he wrought not thoroughly out a single conception. For this
            reason it is that he is the most fatiguing of poets. Yet he
            wearies in having done too little, rather than too much; what
            seems in him the diffuseness of one idea, is the conglomerate
            concision of many;—and this concision it is which renders him
            obscure. With such a man, to imitate was out of the question ; it would have answered no purpose—for he spoke to
            his own spirit alone, which would have comprehended no
            alien tongue;—he was, therefore, profoundly original. His
            quaintness arose from intuitive perception of that truth to
            which Lord Verulam alone has given distinct voice:—“ There
            is no exquisite beauty which has not some strangeness in its
            proportion." But whether obscure, original, or quaint, he
            was at all times sincere. He had no affectations.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>From the ruins of Shelley there sprang into existence, affronting the Heavens, a tottering and fantastic pagoda, in
            which the salient angles, tipped with mad jangling bells,
            were the idiosyncratic faults of the great original—faults
            which cannot be called such in view of his purposes, but
            which are monstrous when we regard his works as addressed to mankind. A “ school” arose—if that absurd term
            must still be employed—a school—a system of rules—upon
            the basis of the Shelley who had none. Young men innumerable, dazzled with the glare and bewildered with the
            bizarrerie of the divine lightning that flickered through the
            clouds of the Prometheus, had no trouble whatever in heaping up imitative vapors, but, for the lightning, were content,
            perforce, with its spectrum, in which the bizarrerie appear- ed without the fire.
            Nor were great and mature minds un-impressed by the contemplation of a greater and
            more ma-ture; and thus gradually were interwoven into this school
            of all Lawlessness—of obscurity, quaintness, exaggeration—
            the misplaced didacticism of Wordsworth, and the even more
            preposterously anomalous metaphysicianism of Coleridge.
            Matters were now fast verging to their worst, and at length,
            in Tennyson, poetic inconsistency attained its extreme. But
            it was precisely this extreme (for the greatest error and the
            greatest truth are scarcely two points in a circle)—it was
            this extreme which, following the law of all extremes,
            wrought in him—in Tennyson—a natural and inevitable revulsion, leading him first to contemn and secondly to investigate his early manner, and, finally, to winnow from its magnificent elements the truest and purest of all poetical styles.
            But not even yet is the process complete; and for this reason in part, but chiefly on account of the mere fortuitousness
            of that mental and moral combination which shall unite in
            one person (if ever it shall) the Shelleyan abandon, the Ten-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>nysonian poetic sense, the most profound instinct of Art, and
            the sternest Will properly to blend and vigorously to control
            all;—chiefly, we say, because such combination of antagonisms must be purely fortuitous, has the world never yet
            seen the noblest of the poems of which it is possible that it
            may be put in possession.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>And yet Miss Barrett has narrowly missed the fulfilment
            of these conditions. Her poetic inspiration is the highest—
            we can conceive nothing more august. Her sense of Art is
            pure in itself, but has been contaminated by pedantic study
            of false models—a study which has the more easily led her
            astray, because she placed an undue value upon it as rare—
            as alien to her character of woman. The accident of having
            been long secluded by ill health from the world has effected,
            moreover, in her behalf, what an innate recklessness did for
            Shelley—has imparted to her, if not precisely that abandon
            to which I have referred, at least a something that stands
            well in its stead—a comparative independence of men and
            opinions with which she did not come personally in contact
            —a happy audacity of thought and expression never before
            known in one of her sex. It is, however, this same accident
            of ill health, perhaps, which has invalidated her original
            Will—diverted her from proper individuality of purpose—and
            seduced her into the sin of imitation. Thus, what she
            might have done we cannot altogether determine. What
            she has actually accomplished is before us. With Tennyson’s works beside her, and a keen appreciation of them in
            her soul—appreciation too keen to be discriminative;—with
            an imagination even more vigorous than his, although somewhat less ethereally delicate; with inferior art and more feeble volition; she has written poems such as he could not
            write, but such as he, under her conditions of ill health and
            seclusion, would have written during the epoch of his pupildom in that school which arose out of Shelley, and from
            which, over a disgustful gulf of utter incongruity and absurdity, lit only by miasmatic flashes, into the broad open meadows of Natural Art and Divine Genius, he—Tennyson—is
            at once the bridge and the transition.
         </p>
         <p>AGINCOURT, by G.P. R. James. [Republished by the Harpers.]
            
         </p>
         <p>This is the title of Mr. James’s last novel, or rather, it is
            the last one that we have seen ; there may be a later one.
            Mr. James has published many volumes, by the help of a
            rapid amanuensis, and the best natured readers hat ever an
            author was blessed with. The books that bear his name on
            their title-page, exceed, in reading matter, the entire literature of the Greeks. And yet, tried by a very low standard,
            Mr. James cannot be called an author. If any of his admirers claim this distinction for him, we should be glad to
            know the beings that owe their existence to him. There are
            many famous authors, whose names are never seen on the
            title-page, of a book. Mr. James and a thousand like him,
            have produced many books ; yet who will speak of them as
            authors a century hence ?
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We read with amazement the catalogue of Scuderi’s and
            Calprenede’s romances, and wonder where they found their
            readers; but what will posterity say to the catalogue of
            what is called the modern school of Romance, to the Jameses,
            and Ainsworths, and Mrs. Gores ? leaving out the Mrs. Sherwoods and Charlotte Elizabeths ? We took up a book a few
            months since, with Mr. James’s name in the title-page, and
            read it through, without discovering, until we reached the
            last chapter, that we had read out of Arrah Neil, by Mr.
            James, into the St. James’s of Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, a part
            of each being bound together: the reading was so much alike,
            and the James and the St. James being all the time at the
            top of the page, that we never perceived that they were different books, by different authors. There is a class of novel
            readers now, as there was in the time of Crebillon, jun., who
            will read any thing that any body will write, provided it be
            in the form of a story with a thread to it. This is essential.
            It matters not how slender the thread may be; their curiosity
         </p>
         <p>
            
         </p>
         <p>will hang upon it, if it will hang of itself; but a chain cable could not hold the attention of such readers, if a link were
            wanting. A book that is read for the sake of the story may
            as well be written by Professor Ingraham, or Eugene Sue, as
            by Fielding, or Walter Scott. As the confirmed tippler is indifferent to the quality of his drink, if it only produces inebriation. We have seen respectable looking ladies, and even
            men, courageous enough to read a James’s novel in a steamboat cabin or a rail-road car. We knew a gentleman who
            read Darnley twice. He is quite as remarkable a person, in
            his way, as the man who read the Monnikins once. We
            also know a country gentleman, who lives in a gothic castle
            somewhere in New Jersey, who always enquires, whenever
            he comes to town, which is about once a fortnight, whether
            there is any thing new by James ? The last time he asked
            this question, we replied, “ Yes, a new title."
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>To review a new novel by Mr. James would be an entire
            loss of time. His claims to notice were long ago determined.
            His position in the literary word is as well defined as though
            he had been dead a century. He must be a huge favourite
            with his own countrymen, who pay a guinea and a half
            apiece for his novels. His is one of “ the silver springs where
            England drinks;" and he drinks their gold in return. With
            us his novels sell for a shilling sterling ; but if we had to
            pay the home price for them, as we ought to do, his transatlantic readers Would be exceeding few. But he has his
            regular customers, like an old established shop, and when he
            gives up business, we have no doubt but that he will sell the
            good-will of his readers to some young beginner in the same
            line; we shall see an advertisement in the Times, one of
            these days, something after this style:	“ A RARE CHANCE.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>For sale low, the good-will of a novel-producing establishment, with a steady set of customers. A skilful amanuensis
            and a large book of quotations will be included in the sale.
            For particulars apply to G. P. R. James, Esquire, Historio-grapher to the Queen.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. James’s style is so stretchy, and his stories are so ea-sily drawn out, that we have often thought he must employ
            in some manner the universal caoutchouc in their composi-tion. We know a gentleman, who once, for lack of better
            business, acted as Mr. James’s amanuensis, and put upon pa-per some half a dozen of his romances. He says that Mr.
            James used to pour them out like a mountebank pulling rib-bons from his mouth, and apparently with as little mental
            exertion. They kept coming continually, but the heap did
            not increase,—the two ends of his stories seemed fastened
            together, and were continually revolving round a pivot, pro-ducing motion, but no increase.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The first chapter in either of Mr. James’s books will afford
            a good example of the manner in which he makes up his
            volumes. Agincourt opens with this wordy catalogue of the
            features of a cloudy night, which any young lady who is
            mistress of the alphabet might do as well.
         </p>

         <p>“ The night was black as ink.” This leaves nothing more
            to be said on the subject; it includes every shade of darkness.
            But terseness of description like this, would not enable Mr.
            James to spin out three volumes every three months, or oftener, so he goes on with his description. “ Not a solitary
            twinkling star looked out through that wide expanse of
            shadow, which our great poet (who is our great poet ?) called
            the ' blanket of the dark;' clouds covered the Heaven;
            the moon had not risen to tinge them even with gray ; and
            the sun had too long set to leave one faint tinge of purple
            upon the western sky. Trees, houses, villages, fields, and
            gardens, all lay in one profound obscurity, and even the
            course of the high road itself, required eyes well accustomed
            to night-traveling, to be able to distinguish it, as it wandered
         </p>
         <p>through a rich part of Hampshire, amid alternate woods and
            meadows.”
            
         </p>
         <p>In the next sentence, the force of habit is described so mi-nutely and profoundly, that it appears as if Mr. James had
            just discovered a new principle, which he was labouring to
            make perfectly plain to his readers. “Habit is more our
            master than we know, and often rules our external demeanour
            whenever the spirit is called to take council in the deep
            chamber within, showing upon the surface, without any effort on our part to hide our thoughts, a very different aspect
            from that of the mind’s business at the moment.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We continually meet with descriptions like this, which
            reads like a tailor’s bill of particulars, but leaves no more impression on the mind than an invoice of merchandise.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Clothed in the most splendid array with which he had
            been able to provide himself, his tight-fitting hose displaying
            to the highest advantage his graceful, yet powerful limbs,
            with the coat of black silk, spotted with flowers of gold, cut
            wide, but gathered into numerous plaits or folds round the
            collar and the waist, and confined by a rich girdle to the
            form, while the sleeves, fashioned to the shape of the arm,
            and fastened at the wrist, showed the contour of the swelling
            muscles;—over his shoulder he wore a short mantle of embroidered cloth, trimmed with costly fur, the sleeves of
            which, according to the custom of the day, were slashed
            down the inner side, so as to suffer the arm to be thrust out
            from them, while they, more for ornament than use, hung
            down to the bend of the knee. On his feet he wore the riding
            boots of the time, thrust down to the ankle; and—in accordance with a custom, then new in the courts of France and
            Burgundy, but which, ere long, found its way to England—
            his heavy sword had been laid aside, and his only arm was
            a rich hiked dagger, suspended by a gold ring from the clasp
            of his girdle. His head was covered with a small bonnet, or
            velvet cap, ornamented with a single long white feather,
            showing that he had not yet reached the knightly rank, and
            round it curled in large waves his glossy dark brown hair.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Nothing more can be said about the attire of this tremen-dous figure, without going into the particulars of his under-clothes, which we rather wonder at his not doing. But not
            yet tired of his clothier-like description, he immediately
            branches off upon the dresses of the six servants who stood
            ready to accompany their master to the dwelling of the
            Count of Charalois.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. James has one very great merit; he never makes use
            of foreign terms, but employs only words that can be found
            in English dictionaries.
         </p>
         <p>The Fine Arts.
            THE ART UNION PICTURES.
            (Second Notice.)
            
         </p>
         <p>Among the landscapes was a river scene by Jesse Talbot,
            which would have been a very effective picture if it had
            been reduced in its dimensions at least two thirds. The
            finest landscapes that have ever been painted are small.
            The thumb nail is wide enough to represent as much grandeur as the eye is capable of receiving from nature. All our
            landscape painters make woful mistakes in the size of their
            canvass. Nearly all of Cole’s paintings are too large for any
            drawing-room; and unless seen from a proper distance, the
            foreground of a large landscape must always produce a dis-agreeable effect; and when a large picture is hung at a suf-ficient distance to give a good effect to the foreground, the
            best part of it is lost entirely. A life size representation of
            nature in a landscape is impossible, except in the scenery of
         </p>
         <p>
            
         </p>
         <p>a theatre, and not often there. There is a very good copy
            of one of Claude’s seaports, at the exhibition room of the
            American Art-Union, which should never be exceeded in
            size by a painted landscape. The tone of a small picture is
            not only more easily preserved than that of a large one, but
            much greater freedom of touch can be given, because elaborateness of detail is not necessary to prevent a coarse unfinished aspect. Mr. Talbot’s landscapes are always pleasing,
            and we discern from year to year a very marked improvement in his productions. If he will forget that he ever saw
            one of Cole’s pictures, and look quietly at Nature with a
            clear eye, and make his own interpretations of her language,
            without asking the aid of any other commentator than his
            own heart, she will reward him as she does all who seek
            communion with her in the integrity of their instincts. The
            river in Mr. Talbot’s picture is quite as liquid as any of
            Cole’s, whose rivers and lakes are either mud or glass.
            It is surprising that a painter who has been so often upon
            the water as Mr. Cole, should never have been able to retain
            a distinct idea of its quality. Transparency, wetness, and
            motion, seem never to have struck him as the peculiar properties of water. His lakes are large mirrors, his rivers
            stone or slime.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>A marine painter should be cradled upon the sea, like
            Vernet. Probably Moses could have painted flowing water
            so naturally that you could have heard it ripple.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There were several little pictures in the distribution, by
            Bonfield, of Philadelphia, who must have led an amphibious
            life in his boyhood. His sea pieces are so full of life and
            motion, that you step aside in passing them to get out of
            reach of the spray. The ship at anchor strains her cable so
            naturally, swayed by the tide and the wind, that you expect
            every moment that she will part from her moorings. His
            water is salt, and full of life. You feel that it is the fishes’
            element. But it has a defect which must be owing to the
            painter having drawn his inspirations from the Delaware; it
            is never clear, and his skies and clouds are of that disagreeable yellowish hue peculiar to English coast scenery. These
            reveal the secret of his birth. An artist whose eyes were
            first opened in our transparent atmosphere, could never paint
            such skies as we see in Mr. Bonfield’s pictures. His vessels,
            too, are all foreign, with American flags at their mast heads.
            But these trifles do not weigh against the world of truth and
            feeling which pervade his paintings. It is with the eye as
            with the tongue, the first impression which we receive from
            Nature will always remain by us. If we are born under a
            cloudy sky, a dull atmosphere will always be pleasantest to
            us. Mr. Bonfield paints from Nature, but not from our
            Nature. But there was a very fine little snow piece in the
            distribution, by this artist, which had a genuine American
            aspect. The appearance of early morning was. beautifully
            given, and the fleecy pink clouds floating in an atmosphere
            of pearly light, contrasted with the dazzling whiteness of
            the snow, and the dark green evergreens, produced a most
            charming and harmonious effect.
         </p>
         <p>The Art Union has distributed a good many of Mr. Bon-
            field’s pictures, but never a poor one that bore his name.
            
         </p>
         <p>One of the most promising landscapes among the pictures
            distributed, was a view of Northeast Lake, Mount Washing-ton, by Wotherspoon, a name new to us among artists. But it
            cannot remain long unknown if its possessor uses his talents
            to any acconnt.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Calculating,” a small interior by T. Hicks, was an admirable little picture, very finely colored, but lacking in interest from the head of the principal figure being entirely hidden by his hat.</p>
         <p>
            
            
            
            
            
         </p>
         <p>“A lazy fisherman” by Chapman, might have been called a
            lazy painter with equal truth. The landscape part of the picture looked as though it had been done with a white-wash
            brush. It is a matter of surprise that an artist of his reputation should allow such a performance to leave his hands.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The same remarks might be applied to the landscapes
            of Mr. Oddie, which have generally something in them to
            admire ; a modest adherence to nature in parts, but in parts
            the most unaccountable negligence. We cannot understand
            why an artist of Mr. Oddie’s talents should give so little
            finish to his performances. As sketches they are full of promise, but as paintings they are always defective.
         </p>
         <p>MONUMENTS TO MR. CLAY.
            
         </p>
         <p>The defeat of Mr. Clay is likely to result in good to a class
            of citizens who could have expected nothing in the same way
            from his election. If half the plans which have been proposed for erecting monuments in his honour should be carried
            out, all the architects and sculptors in the country will have
            abundant employment for the next ten years; and the whig
            states will present the appearance of a chess-board, so numerous will be the obelisks and columns, erected in them.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We understand that a meeting of Mr. Clay’s friends was
            held at the Astor House, a few evenings since, at which
            William B. Astor presided, and that it was determined to
            employ Mr. Crawford to execute a statue of the great statesman ; and that ten thousand dollars were subscribed for that
            purpose. This is all very liberal, and very proper. Mr. Crawford has gained his reputation by hard work, and he can
            be safely entrusted with such a commission. But if there is
            to be a more public testimonial to Mr. Clay, in the shape of
            a monument, we trust that proposals will be issued for plans,
            that the best talent in the country may be employed, and
            that our young artists may have an opportunity to show what
            they are capable of doing.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There is not probably another city in the world of the size
            of New York, which cannot boast of a single monument
            erected to commemorate some event in its history. The
            merchants of our city have built an Exchange, at a cost
            greatly exceeding that of the Royal Exchange in London,
            which is not enriched by the slightest trophy of art, to
            commemorate the names of any of the illustrious men, by
            whose wisdom and patriotism the city and the state have
            grown in wealth and importance, or to indicate the uses to
            which it is devoted; while the Royal Exchange in London,
            is profusely decorated with emblematical figures, and statues
            of all the monarchs that have reigned in England. We nowhere see finer private residences than in this city; no town
            on the continent will compare with New York, in the number of elegant houses, and in the evidences of a liberal outlay for individual comfort; but there are few that have less
            proofs of a liberal outlay for the public good.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We have heard nothing recently about the Washington
            Monument; and unless some other plan should be adopted
            than that which has been exhibited, we hope never to hear
            of it again. Mayor Harper is deserving of a monument
            himself, for preventing its foundation from being laid in
            Union Square. If such a disgrace were to be inflicted upon
            this city as the erection of a monument after Mr. Pollard's
            absurd model, it should be put as much out of sight as possible. Gothic churches, in the nineteenth century, are sufficiently out of character; but a Gothic monument, in honour
            of Washington, is the very sublime of nonsense. The idea
            would have been every way worthy of the original wise
            men of Gotham.
         </p>
         <p>
            MISS DELIA WEBSTER,
            
         </p>
         <p>This dangerous person it appears has been condemned to
            confinement in the state prison of Kentucky by the gallant
            people of that state. If the age of chivalry has passed away,
            it is at least some consolation to know that the age of gallantry remains. It is reported in the newspapers that the
            jury who convicted Miss Webster, recommended her to mercy on the score of her sex, but we hardly think that this can
            be true. The Kentuckians are too brave a people to allow so
            dangerous a person as this young lady to go at large among
            them. The chivalrous Carolinians assembled in great multitudes in Charleston, to defend themselves from a gray-headed old man and his young daughter, but they allowed him
            to escape without doing him any personal violence. The
            Kentuckians have proved themselves a much more chivalrous people in their conduct towards Miss Webster, who being a stranger among them, and engaged in the disreputable and unfeminine business of teaching children for her support, was a person much to be dreaded. What makes the
            gallantry of the Kentuckians appear in a more amiable light,
            is the confession of guilt on the part of Miss Webster in a
            letter to her former pastor in Massachusetts, dated in the
            Lexington jail, where she had the entire freedom of the cell,
            the gallant people having very kindly omitted to manacle
            her limbs ; a favor which was not shown to the Methodist
            preacher who was suspected of being a participator in her
            guilt. “ I have twenty fellow prisoners,” says Miss Webster ; “ Mr. Fairbanks, the methodist preacher, is heavily
            ironed, and in a small dungeon with fifteen others, mostly
            blacks. Two of his companions are to be executed in a few
            days.” We put this on record that we may be able to point
            triumphantly to the gallantry of the Kentuckians, in refusing
            to put irons upon Miss Webster, in case any malignant foreigner should ever disparage the working of our “ domestic
            institutions."
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Miss Webster it appears is the daughter of a Vermont
            farmer, who has always been strongly opposed to the abolitionists, but the inhabitants of Lexington must have looked
            upon her with a good deal of distrust when they remembered the heavy abolition vote which her state gave at the last
            election; and accordingly, when they could no longer shut
            their eyes to her enormous guilt, they very wisely shut her
            up in prison.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“On one occasion,” says Miss Webster in her letter,
            “ perhaps when over excited, I remarked in company, that if
            all the black population could be banished from our loved
            country, I would cheerfully go myself to the wild and desert
            shores of Africa to teach them that they have immortal
            souls. This was perhaps an imprudent remark. If so, pardon me. It is the only one I am guilty of. At the time I
            felt it, and even now I know not that I am prepared to recall it.” She not only confesses her guilt, but she justifies
            it. A very dangerous person.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“All I need here is friends,” says Miss Webster. She
            probably wants to bribe the upright judges of that gallant
            State. “I have only one hundred and fifteen dollars by me.
            This will not do much towards paying lawyers. The fees
            of lawyers already amount to seven hundred and fifty dollars.
            These expose themselves to great censure by appearing at
            all on this exciting occasion.” Great censure probably from
            the other members of the profession for working so cheap.
            We are happy to find by this part of Miss Webster’s letter
            that the profession maintains its dignity in Kentucky by taking all it can get, even from a friendless woman in jail, confined on suspicions of having an intention of going cheerfully
            to the wild and desert shores of Africa to teach the blacks
            that they have immortal souls.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Miss Webster, we believe, is still in prison, at least we have
            seen no account of her release, and of course her situation as
            principal of the Female Academy of Lexington is vacant.
            Here is a desirable situation for some northern woman of
            proper accomplishments. The successor of Miss Webster in
            the Female Academy will have the happiness of knowing
            that in the event of her ever becoming her successor in jail,
            she will have the entire freedom of her dungeon without any
            of the hindrances of double chains about her wrists and
            ancles.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It was in a Lexington that the first blood was shed in the
            cause of American Independence. It was very proper therefore that the first imprisonment of a helpless woman for her
            sympathies in the same cause should take place in a town
            of the same name. But lest future historians should confound the two places, in narrating these illustrious events,
            we think that the name of one of them should be changed.
         </p>
         <p>THE DUTCH AND THE PURITANS:
            Or, NEW YORK VERSUS MASSACHUSETTS.
            
         </p>
         <p>New York and Pennsylvania are continually making wry faces at
            the arrogance of New England, in boasting of her Pilgrim Fathers, as
            though they alone were entitled to any credit, in the colonial history
            of the country. Plymouth Rock is a morsel too hard for the digestion of Dutch stomachs. They are always uneasy when it is named,
            and the happy hit of Mr. Reyburn, in calling it the Blarneystone of
            America, caused more merriment among the Stuyvesants, and people
            with a Van to their names, than any witticism that has been uttered
            since the days of Walter the Testy.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The arrogance of the New Englanders is not to be commended, but
            we do not comprehend the wisdom of sectional jealousies towards the
            Pilgrim stock. History has no parallel to the founding of Plymouth
            Colony. It is a fact which concerns not Massachusetts alone, but the
            whole earth. The May-flower brought to this continent a more precious freightage than any other vessel ever discharged upon its shores.
            The name of no other ship that brought colonists to America has
            become immortal. The May-flower will bloom forever; it is too
            brightly embroidered in our history, too firmly woven in song and story.
            The names of no other settlers upon our shores are as familiar as
            those of Plymouth. Carver, Standish, Brewster, and White, are
            household words. Any child can tell you who and what they were.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The New Englander may be allowed to boast of his Pilgrim Fathers ;
            but the New Yorker, and every other American, should also boast of
            the Pilgrim Fathers. It is by no means a clear case, that the United
            States would now be an Independent Nation, had the Pilgrims never
            landed at Plymouth. Massachusetts is the inheritor of the name, but
            all mankind are inheritors of the fame of the Pilgrim Fathers. All
            the blustering and boasting of Massachusetts could never convince
            the world of the greatness of her founders, if their own acts did not establish it.
            The founders of the other Colonies were adventurers—
            but the founders of Massachusetts were pilgrims; here is all the difference. New England makes no boasts—she simply points to her
            men and their acts. They do not take from the altitude of others,
            because they tower so high themselves. “ There they are,” as Judge
            Warren said the other day, “ aristocrats cradled on a rock, not rocked
            in a cradle.” And aristocrats they are of the highest grade, who dig,
            and sow, and reap; who earn their patents of nobility in the workshop, the field, and the ocean.

         <p></p>
         <p>In the early days of the Republic, before sectional jealousies began
            to break out, like foul sores in our system, the nation willingly yielded
            itself to the guidance of Massachusetts mind, and prospered. During
            the first forty years after the adoption of the Constitution, Massachusetts had more than twice as many Representatives in the National
            Cabinet as New York had, and treble the number of Pennsylvania.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Although our vast territory is now pretty well irrigated with streams
            from the Pilgrim stock, we can ill afford to spare a drop which flows
            from that source; there is too little of similar blood in the country.
            In looking upon the Pilgrims, we are too apt to see nothing but their
            religious faults, which were glaring enough; and even their descendants as frequently laud them for their foibles as for their virtues. But
            the peculiar trait of the Pilgrims was their opposition to tyranny. It
            is this which has set them apart from other men. If a love of freedom were a common quality, such men as William Tell would not
         </p>
         <p>
            
         </p>
         <p>rise so high above the heads of the multitude. Great men must always stand alone. It is only by a cone that a great altitude can be
            reached, and the higher you ascend the less room will be found.
            Whoever reaches the top must stand alone. This Excelsior is an
            unsocial cry. Mankind, in extolling such men as the Pilgrims, pronounce themselves slaves. The Pilgrims were not remarkable men
            to each other ; William Tell would have hailed them as mates, not
            men to wonder at and talk about.
         </p>
         <p>But we are wandering from our purpose. We intended only to make
            a few remarks introductory to a speech from somebody else.
            
         </p>
         <p>An amusing instance of the complacency of New England pride occurred at the dinner of the New York Historical Society last month.
            To give importance to their festival, they had invited Mr. Adams, the
            old man eloquent, as the newspapers call him, without adding, as they
            ought to do, the next line of the sonnet from which the phrase is quoted, “ once president.” All the talk, all the speeches, and all the toasts,
            or nearly all, were about New England, and the Pilgrims. The givers
            of the feast were entirely overlooked, and the guests with great coolness, toasted themselves. It was like the case of the famous American-Parisian Colonel, whose titled guests refused to acknowledge him
            as an acquaintance, while they ate his supper and drank his wine. This
            was all in bad taste, to say the least of it, and it was no wonder that
            some sturdy New Yorkers took offence at the quiet contempt of their
            guests. Dutch blood, though slow to rise, at last began to boil, and a
            member of the society jumped upon his feet, and, proposing the following toast, reminded his fellow members that New York had a history
            as well as New England.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“NEW YORK—The Empire Colony of the old Thirteen Provinces. Her
            motto still 'EXCELSIOR.’ May her Eagle in his proudest flight, never forget
            the gallant trials which first nerved his pinion.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, Mr. President, (said the
            gentleman who offered this toast,*) I claim your indulgence for a few
            words, in explanation of the sentiment I have just offered. [Hear.]
            Commenting sportively to the friend by my side, upon the ingenious
            avoidance to-night of any allusion to those who entertained the planters of Plymouth rock for twelve years, in Old Amsterdam, or the historical associations of those who have to-day entertained their descendants for as many hours in New Amsterdam, it was suggested by
            a fellow-member that the proceedings of this celebration would wear rather an awkward
            aspect when given to the world. Our anniversary
            festival would seem to be held rather in commemoration of Massachusetts than of New York. [Hear, hear.] Another gentleman opposite to me has also suggested that inasmuch as this Society has been,
            from time to time, liberally aided by the State Legislature, it were
            positively disrespectful to the people who are represented in that
            Legislature, if no special reference to their past history should be
            made, upon an occasion like the present. [Hear, hear—speak louder.]
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The able discourses upon early New York, delivered before this
            Society more than a generation since, by Governeur Morris and De
            Witt Clinton, and some fifteen years later by Chancellor Kent and
            Gulian C. Verplanck—names not yet wholly forgotten by the present
            population of New York—induced a hope, in the early part of the
            evening, that by some allusion, either to these productions or to
            the past history which those productions illustrate; or, finally, to the
            names of those eminent New Yorkers themselves, the office which I
            have thus hastily undertaken would be measurably fulfilled.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The majority of the company, however, have, I presume, like myself, been so much interested in the eloquent commentaries upon
            the local annals of Massachusetts, and the ever-memorable excellence
            of her pilgrim fathers, that the hours have sped on in perfect forgetfulness of our forefathers. [Hear, hear.] Sir, we have heard much
            to-night of "the pure Anglo-Saxon stock,” and of the men who first
            settled on the Eastern outer-casing of this continent. We have heard
            little of those who struck inwardly to its heart, and grappled at once
            with its strong vital pulsations at the head of its tide-waters. We
            have heard nothing, sir, since we left yonder church, of those bold Bel-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>gic navigators, whose flag led that of Britain on every sea; those
            devoted Huguenots who sprang with such vigor from beneath the
            shadow of despotism, that they made but one bound from luxurious
            France to this then savage wilderness; those brave English cavaliers,
            who, recoiling from Puritan intolerance with the same spirit as did
            the Huguenots from Papal bigotry, came hither with little but cloak
            and rapier, to carve out their fortunes amid the forests of New York.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>A trinity of good blood, that in producing God-like men would mate
            with the Anglo-Saxon the world over. But here, [Hear, hear, and vo-ciferous cheers.]
            sir, I wish I could recall now the eloquent language
            of Governeur Morris, when he speaks of the fusion of these three
            races upon a soil which had already nurtured the noblest and most powerful race of
            Aborigines upon this continent—the Roman like and far-conquering Iroquois ! That I
            could recall, too, his predictions
            of what those blended forces of best manhood must accomplish, in a
            region whose natural resources afford a field for all the most powerful
            energies of civilization ! He looked upon the Susquehannah connect-ing us with the
            Chesapeake; upon the Genessee connecting us with
            the Gulf of St. Lawrence ; upon the Alleghany linking us with the
            sea of Mexico; upon the great Lakes binding us to the boundless West; upon the Hudson
            uniting us with the civilized world: He turned from the bloody school of our energies,
            in a hundred and fifty years of border wars, and imagined those same indomitable powers
            applied to the arts of peace ! [Cheers.]
         </p>
         <p>* Mr. C. F. Hoffman.
            
         </p>
         <p>Sir, the curious speculative theory of that philosophic statesman
            is now History. Yes, sir, it has been history or more than twenty
            years. [Prolonged cheering.] Sir, the men of New York were acting History while those in other States were writing it for us and our
            children. Am I extravagant? It must be so, sir, or how else could
            our own brilliant early annals become overlaid, as they are, by the
            purely local, and to us comparatively foreign themes of the Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrim Fathers ! [A voice.] “We must look
            nearer home," some gentleman observes ; our gazetteers and school
            histories are certainly nearly all prepared by New Englanders ignorant of our annals, and unsympathizing in our story. Why, I saw
            a new octavo Gazetteer this very day, in which several pages are
            gravely quoted from Knickerbocker’s New York, as veritable history.
            [A laugh.] But I will "look nearer home,” as the gentleman invites
            me. Sir, the successful mingling of those wondrous waters has raised
            such a wave as almost to wash from the memory of the present generation the deeds of colonial enterprise upon which Mr. Morris predicted his generous prophecy. We hear much of “ the Empire State,”
            we forget "the Empire Colony”—the province where the two most
            powerful nations of Europe so long contended for empire. We forget that with a population
            less than that of cither Massachusetts or Virginia, here was the great seat of English executive and colonial power,
            in time of peace ; and here, as Chancellor Kent has so happily termed
            it, "the Flanders of North America,” in time of war. Mr. President,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>the old military glory of New York should not be thus forgotten!
            Surely, the martial spirit of our fathers has cost enough in years gone
            by ! That martial spirit which, leaving so few non-combatants, made
            ! the Revolution within our borders truly a civil war: That spirit of action which
            compelled every New Yorker to take up arms for king
            or colony,—which furnished regiment alter regiment to the Crown,
            and treble the number to the Confederacy; which blazed forth with
            all its desperate energies, in the death-grapple of brothers at
            Oriskany, and which is traceable in the gallantry of New York’s
            exiled sons down to the field of Waterloo ! Surely that military spirit
            of the storied past should not be forgotten, while we enjoy its nest
            fruits in the prosperous present. [Never, never ; three cheers.]
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ The battle-field of America !” Why, sir. the border conflicts
            with naked savages of all the States put together, would not fill up
            the military page of our history, even previous to—[A voice, “ the
            Revolution,”] not the Revolution—no, sir, nor what is called " the
            old French War,”—but previous to the year of grace, 1700 ! [Hear.]
         </p>
         <p> Is it too late ? or will gentlemen yet bear with me for a few
            moments, in a rapid enumeration of a few solid facts. [Go on, go on.]
            
         </p>
         <p>I will go on. We have heard much to-night of what our Eastern
            neighbours have endured for the promotion of doctrine,—it may be
            healthful to hear what our fathers did for the protection of home.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>You have heard from our Orator, before we came to the table, that
            the Dutch Hollanders penetrated to Albany, in 1609, the same year
            that the French, under La Roche, reached Lake George. You are
            aware, too, that both France and Holland laid a claim to the intermediate country predicated upon these several discoveries. It may be
            necessary to remind you, though, that to enforce their claim the
            French soon commenced supplying the Hurons, and other Canadian
            Indians, with fire-arms,—while the Dutch were equally on the alert
            to furnish the Iroquois* with Europern weapons to repel them. For
            nearly thirty years the French were more or less successful, in making
            inroads upon this Province ; but in 1650 the Iroquois beat them back
            to Montreal, stormed the garrison of Trois Rivieres, and carried off
            the commandant prisoner. Those victors were "Natives” of New
            York. [Cheers.] Yes! in thirty years her strong soil had already
            produced a crop of men from the aboriginal stock, capable of contending with veterans who had fought under the greatest captains of
            modern Europe. But I must not delay with comments upon the hurried enumeration which may yet try your patience. In 1666, De
            Tracy, De Chaumont, and De Courcelles, with twelve hundred
            French soldiers, two pieces of cannon, and a thousand Indians and
            camp followers, descended upon the Mohawk and carried off many
            Iroquois prisoners, which were afterwards sent to the galleys in
            France. The northern and western barrier of the Province seemed
            giving away, and its ultimate subjection to the arms of France seemed
            inevitable, when in 1685 M. de la Barre descended with a force of
            seventeen hundred men, upon Sackett’s Harbor—yet three years
            afterwards, in 1688, we again find twelve hundred New York Indians
            under the walls of Montreal. [Cheers.] "
            I give you four days to
            decide,” said their leader to the French commandant, “ I give you
            four days to decide, whether you accept the terms of pence offered
            you by New York, or be driven into the sea.” They did accept them !
            [Cheers.]
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1690 we find the French again within fifteen miles of Albany,—
            they succeeded in burning Schenectady—but a few months afterwards
            these red New Yorkers are again upon the island of Montreal, and
            though repulsed, they left their traces in blood and ashes, cut off one
            of the outposts, killed the commandant, and carried off several officers.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1691 the adventurous Frenchmen again penetrated to the Mohawk, and again in the same year the Iroquois have driven them from
            our borders, on Champlain and Ontario.
         </p>
         <p>“The only way to conquer the Iroquois,” said M. De Nonville to
            Louis XIV., “ is by the previous conquest of New York.”
            “ The only way to save New York,” said Leisler, the people’s Gov-
            ernor, " is by the previous conquest of Canada.”
            
         </p>
         <p>In 1692, a fleet was commissioned by the Court of France to reduce
            the City of New York, and get the mastery of the Hudson ; and an
            army transported from France to strike at Albany, by the way of
            Canada; but while these forces are crossing the Atlantic, the New
            York Indians have again driven the French within the defences of
            Montreal.
         </p>
         <p>In 1693 the French are repulsed from Schenectady by Peter Schuyler,
            * Called also "Mingoes” and "Five Nations."
            
            at the head of two hundred and ninety white, and two hundred and
            fifty red, New Yorkers. [Cheers and a laugh.]
            
         </p>
         <p>In 1695 we find a command of three hundred French soldiers obtaining an advantage over the New York confederates at Oswego, while
            five hundred, who made their descent by the way of Lake Champlain,
            are beaten back with loss.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1696, one of the best appointed armies that ever displayed upon
            this continent, landed at Oswego, under command of the veteran
            general Count de Frontenac. Cannon, mortars, grenades, four heavy
            battalions of musqueteers, with a commissariat amply provided,—an
            army led on by an array of Counts, Barons, Chevaliers, and private
            gentleman volunteers, each with his following of servants and camp
            equipage, penetrated in their batteaux, from Oswego into Lake Onondago, on whose banks they built a fort, and then proceeded to ravage
            the country. So active was the Baron de Beckancourt, the Chevalier
            de Grais, de Mesnil, and other French nobles, all bent upon distinguishing themselves in this wild and, as they thought, romantic warfare, that all that portion of New York cultivated by our demi-civilized tribes, was reduced to desolation, by their ravages. A fearful
            famine succeeded ; yet again and again is the red arm of the Iroquois
            felt in Canada, till the peace of Ryswick brought a breathing spell
            to both colonies.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1710 the Province of New York is again converted into an armed
            camp. The troops of Connecticut and New Jersey being mustered at
            Wood Creek with her own, to prevent the French from breaking
            through to the Atlantic, by way of the Hudson.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1711, four thousand Provincials, with six hundred Iroquois, mustered at Albany, while the old border struggles are renewed till the
            peace of Utrecht, in 1713.
         </p>
         <p>In 1727 the Province is again in arms, under Governeur Burnet,
            marching upon the French, at Niagara.
            
         </p>
         <p>In 1746 Saratoga is surprised by the French and Hurons, and thirty
            families are cut off in a night,—while in the same year the New York
            confederates carry off a whole garrison, from within ten leagues of
            Montreal; and thus the frontier war continued to rage till the treaty
            of Aix-la-Chapelle brought a temporary peace to the Province.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>1755 brings us to the battle of Lake George, where Sir William
            Johnson won his spurs, and where eight hundred of the invaders,
            under Dieskau, were left dead upon the field.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The assault of the Marquis of Montcalm, on Fort Ontario, with
            four thousand troops, follows ; and the massacre of Fort William
            Henry, at Lake George, with the devastation of German Flats, on the
            Mohawk, by the invaders, brings us to (1758) the duplicate battle of Lake George,
            when seventeen thousand men under Abercrombie, were
            defeated by the French; the reduction of Fort Frontinac, on Lake Ontario, by three
            thousand provincials; the fight with the galleys, on
            Lake Champlain, and the different affairs of Crown Point and Ticonderoga.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In 1776, the empire Colony, where European competitors have so long
            contended for the mastery of this northern continent, became herself—the aspirant for Empire. Need I enumerate our storied fields of the Revolution?
            To set them justly before you—to trace the spirit that animated many of them, I should
            begin with the popular movements for liberty in New York, long years preceding the
            Decla- ration of Independence ! But I must not dilate upon the incidental branches
            of my theme. It is the military story, too,—not the political, annals of New York, that I am attempting thus hastily to illus-trate. Within
            the seven years of the Revolution, the Battle of Long ;
            Island, the Battle of White Plains, the Storming of Stoney Point, the
            affair of Fort Montgomery, the Burning of Kingston, the sanguinary
            struggles of Cherry Valley and the Mohawk, with Oriskany, the
            bloodiest field of all our Revolutionary conflicts, and Saratoga, the
            most glorious, crowd in with Niagara, Saratoga, and Crown Point, to
            mark their names yet again upon the blazing tablet of our military
            annals. [Great sensation.]
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>1814—And yet again, [Continued cheers,] and yet again the events
            at Erie and Sackett’s Harbor, at Champlain and Niagara, come in to
            swell the record of deeds of arms, and approve New York the Battle
            field of the Union, the Flanders of American history. [Vociferous
            cheering.]
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Sir, I am grateful for the patience with which, at this late hour, I
            have been listened to by the company, but I make no apology for thus
            detaining them. It is good to remember—it is good for peoples, as
            well as individuals, to remember who they are, what they are, and
            how they came thus. There is no one to speak for us ; it is time we should speak for
            ourselves. Our neighbors have been writing history while we have been acting it. I
            respect, I reverence, sir, the zeal
            with which they preserve their own annals, but it is full time we should
            see that they so write them as not to overlay and obliterate ours.
            Their generalizations about "the pure Anglo-Saxon race” have already become naturalized here ; the specific phrase of "our Pilgrim
            Fathers" is rapidly following; sir, the history of this State is no history of “ the Puritan Anglo-Saxon,” and save as the descendants of
            those earnest-souled, vigorous-minded men who fought side by side with
            us, in the Revolution, our provincial annals are no more to be merged
            in those of Massachusetts than they are in those of Virginia. The
            bird that bears excelsior in his beak was fledged on our own soil.
            He never began his soarings from Plymouth Rock. He dressed his
            plumage in our own lakes, and his pinions were nerved in the air of
            our own mountains.
         </p>
         <p>GOOD ADVICE.
            
         </p>
         <p>The market is always overstocked with good advice; but
            nobody knows how abundant the article is so well as an
            editor of a newspaper. To all our friends who have generously extended their aid to us in the way of advice, we re-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>turn our hearty thanks, and will endeavor to profit by their
            innumerable and conflicting opinions. Some gentlemen who
            are not of sufficient consequence to be fallen a-foul-of themselves, recommend us to be very massacrante, and spare neither sex nor condition in our criticisms; others are of opinion,
            that the only true course for an editor is to be calm, quiet,
            and dignified; to study the weathercock of popular favor, and
            strive to keep always before the wind. A gentleman writes
            us a short hasty note, in a red-pepper looking hand, in these
            words:
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Dear Sir—I like your plan much; go ahead. Cut up
            everything; slash away right and left—don't leave an error
            standing on its legs. Yours, in haste,	Gr. C.
         </p>
         <p>P. S. There is one author that you mus’nt say anything
            ill about—Mr.——, he is a friend of mine.”
            
         </p>
         <p>Another kind friend has sent us a long letter, containing
            a set of rules to be observed in our critical capacity; but
            whether they are meant in earnestness or jest, we cannot
            determine. But we will print them for the benefit of others,
            who may not, like ourselves, have any settled principles in
            criticism.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Sir—I perceive that you have established a Critical
            Journal, and not doubting but that you may need assistance
            in your undertaking, I send you the following rules, which I
            drew up for myself and an associate in a Quarterly Review,
            which was projected but never published. They are entirely at your service, and I hope will do you much good.”
         </p>
         <p>RULES FOR CRITICISM.
            
         </p>
         <p>Rule 1. In regard to an Author's first appearance.—It
            will always be safe to condemn every author on his first
            appearance, without being at the trouble of examining his
            productions. And as this can be done in very concise and
            biting terms, it will afford a good opportunity for a young
            practitioner to try his hand; the chances are, that good will
            result from such a course. As nobody will read an author’s
            first book, which has been condemned without reservation,
            the critic will gain credit for smartness without anybody ever
            suspecting that it is not deserved. There is but little danger
            from this course, because unknown authors are generally the
            most obscure of all unknown people, and as they will have
            no friends to advocate their cause, they will be too much
            cowed ever to do it themselves. It will generally, too, be
            the most just way of proceeding with a young author, although the justice of it is not a thing of much consequence,
            as first attempts in authorship, like first attempts in everything else, are generally immature and ill executed. It is a
            well-known historical fact, that Rome was not built in a day,
            and it takes time even to make an author. But if it should
            turn out that your criticism was unjust, and instead of crushing a small genius, you should arouse a great one, the world
            will think well of you for having called into action talents
            which might else have been lulled to sleep by the syren
            strains of flattery.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Rule 2. In regard to Publishers.—If a book is issued by
            a young publisher, the above rule will apply with a slight
            modification. It must always be remembered, that a publisher may, at some time or other, have it in his power to
            serve you; and it will therefore be good policy to treat him
            with more consideration than you would a mere author, unless you happen to have some personal knowledge of his
            circumstances, and know him to be destitute of capital and
            powerful friends. Respecting a rich and flourishing publisher, I can hardly deem it neeessary to give any direction,
            for I cannot suppose that any critic would be so ignorant of
            the first principles of his profession, as not to perceive the
            importance of conciliating the good will of those who have
         </p>
         <p>
            
         </p>
         <p>it in their power to serve him, either by sending him copies
            of valuable works, or by publishing for him when he wants
            to become an author himself. But the critic must not feel
            himself under an obligation to read even the publications of
            a rich house. It will be sufficient to say of a book, that the
            name of the publisher is a warrant of its merit, or that no
            library can be complete without it—which you may safely
            do, for libraries would be reduced to very small dimensions
            if they contained nothing but good books.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Rule 3. Wherever a book differs from all others that you
            have read, and having no standard to compare it with, you
            are at a loss for an opinion, but are determined, notwith-standing, to give one.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>To the mere neophyte this may be a perplexing situation,
            but to an experienced critic it has as few difficulties as any
            other. Let the spirit of the book alone to take care of itself,
            or to be handled by some more daring or more competent
            hand, and proceed after verbal errors: every book contains
            enough of these to damn it, if it were judged by them
            alone. It will be a hard case if you do not find a dozen
            or two of misapplied prepositions, or a superfluous con-junction or two. And when you have exhausted these,
            there will still be typographical errors in abundance to
            fall back upon; after which, if your review should lack
            either length or malice, you will still have the paper, the
            title, the letter press, the size of the volume, the binding,
            and the publisher to help you out. Every fault discovered
            in a book helps to hinder its sale and answers the end of
            criticism, which is to make the critic and not the author ap-pear to advantage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Rule 4. When an author makes you feel his merit, but
            either from envy, or personal dislike, or a desire to injure his
            publisher, you are determined to roast him.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Malicious people have generally good inventive powers,
            and are never at a loss for a method to do an ill-natured turn.
            In any other case than that of a critic, we should consider it
            impertinent to offer advice ; but our critics are so little used
            to thinking for themselves, that we fear our instructions are
            needed even here. There are difficulties in this case, it must
            be admitted, for a jockey who should try to prove that a horse
            is a mule, would be in danger of being laughed at for an ass
            himself. Therefore the safest way to proceed will be to try
            the book by negatives, and condemn it for not being what the
            author never intended to make it. By this process you will
            compel even the author himself to acknowledge the truth of
            your criticism; and with those who depend upon you for
            their own opinions, you will be regarded as a profound,
            splendid, and brilliant reviewer. Of all the differ-ent methods
            of reviewing a book, this affords the widest margin for a dis-play of your own learning and humor? because it does not
            confine you to the work under notice, but enables you to
            quote liberally from the last book that you may have read.
            If the book you quote from should happen to be on a different subject from that which you are reviewing, it will help
            to make the author appear very ridiculous, by showing how
            unlike he is to somebody else. If, for instance, you were
            reviewing “ A Tale of a Tub,” by comparing it with the
            “ Tales of my Landlord,” or “ Crabbe’s Tales," or the “ Can-terbury Tales,” or “Hogg's Tales,” you would prove to the
            satisfaction of the meanest comprehension, that it was not
            only destitute of all merit as a tale, and that the name was a
            misnomer, but that it was in every respect a ridiculous
            work.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Nothing is easier than to make another person appear
            ridiculous, but it is not always easy at the same time not to
            make yourself appear so; therefore, great caution must al-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>ways be observed in cutting up an author, not to inflict
            wounds upon yourself. In a review, the main object is to make the reviewer, not the
            reviewed, appear to advantage.
            The critic must therefore glean all the wit and information
            I that he can out of the book he is reviewing, and intersperse
            them through his article, without naming the source of their origin. The very highest
            effort of a reviewer is to place
            himself between the public and the author, so that the au-thor may be entirely lost sight of by the time his article
            draws to a close.	 H.

         <p>SKETCHES OF AMERICAN PROSE WRITERS.*
            NO. 1.
            WILLIAM. A. JONES.
            
         </p>
         <p>There are several very good reasons why a series of articles should be written on the American Prose Writers. In
            the first place many of them are very clever men, and
            deserve this formal recognition of their merits; and it is one of the most natural
            of all impulses, that leads us, while we
            are day after day feasting on their intellectual beef and trifle,
            to offer up a few words of grace in a complimentary criticism.
            In the second place, many of our best prose writers are com-paratively unknown, and it will be doing the public a greater
            service than the writers themselves, to speak of their merits.
            In the third place, it may happen that a few of these authors
            may be partially misunderstood, and criticism surely needs
            no apology when it is employed in removing any of the im-pediments which beset the discovering of truth. In the
            fourth place we hold the prose writers to have quite as good
            a claim to be celebrated as the poets of whom so much has
            latterly been said. In the fifth, a native author has certainly a right, in the present state of things, to all the crumbs he
            can get. In the sixth place, the public like this kind of
            biographical and gossipping table talk. And the seventh—a
            reason which we should hold sufficient were all the rest
            good for nothing—contributors must write and magazines
            must be filled, come what will of it.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We shall establish no order of precedence in the men or
            women we write about, nor set up any standard of exclusiveness further than what we have just indicated in this very
            sentence, that the authors and authoresses shall be men or
            women, with some kindling vitality in them—not mere walking gentlemen and ladies, hobby-de-hoys or copy-book
            misses.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Without more ado in the way of preface, we plunge our
            arms into the huge chest in which we have collected our
            material, and out of the heap of volumes, magazines, pamph-lets, files of newspapers, there thrown together, a richer colllection than you will find on the shelves of any bookseller,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>we extricate a huge bundle, strongly corded and labelled after our fancy, “ Manifold and excellent illustrations of En-glish literature—foreign and at home, old and recent, by
            William A. Jones.” There are at least, if drawn out from their hiding places, and
            printed in book form, a thousand
            pages of them, and quantity no less than quality shall be our
            harvest for asserting the claims, for the first time among critics, of a fresh American
            author.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>What has he written and how has he written, are the first
            questions when a new name is mentioned in literature—First
            the facts, then the comment, and lastly the conclusion.—
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Though we consider the mere quantity that an author writes
            by no means the best proof of his merits, and remember that
            even the greatest reputations are generally sustained by a
         </p>

            prose writers, since the Revolution.
            
            
         </p>
         <p>very few pages, which are all that the great public are ac-quainted with, yet as an incidental proof of capacity, especi-ally in the present circumstances of reading and writing, it
            is quite necessary that an author show, by his power of sus-taining himself, that he has not blundered or stumbled into
            literature, or got there by sheer impudence and trickery. An
            ordinary man may borrow with ingenuity, or be stung by the
            passion of the moment to produce a few vivid words, but we
            may not call him an author. The perfection of literature
            requires both art and nature. It is possible that a man in
            conversation may display higher powers of wit, humour or
            sentiment; than another may in writing, or a man may write
            mechanically as every decently educated person now-a-days
            can, without feeling. Neither of these deserve the name of
            authors.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>How much has he written, then, is a fair question. We
            have a great horror of making notabilities out of nothing, so
            we proceed to give an account of Mr. Jones’s labours, an im-posing word, by which what ought to be called the recreations
            of genius, pass current with a dull minded world.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Jones’s earliest papers were written for the American
            Monthly Magazine, while it was edited by Park Benjamin,
            and were soon after collected and published with a few oth-ers from the New Yorker in a volume, entitled The Analyst,
            in 1840. The peculiarity of this volume was its exhibition
            of the early development of the critical faculty, proving, as
            has been proved since in very many cases, that there is at
            times an early harvest for the judgment as well as for the
            apparently more youthful fancy and sentiment. One of the
            most remarkable examples of this, is in a case pointed out
            by Mr. Jones himself in a paper on the early maturity of Ge-nius, that of Owen Felltheim, who was as wise as Bacon
            and pointed as La Bruyere at the age of nineteen.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The matter is easily explained. Whatever a man can do
            in literature or in active life, what is most characteristic of
            him, he is apt to do with the first salient spring of youth and
            ripened physical energy, before the sinews are hardened by
            time, or the heart by the world. This is true generally. Of
            that large portion of books which is built up on the pas-sion of love, it is always true. Special circumstances may
            supply to some minds, in other cases, what the difference of
            years could not teach the dull and sluggish. Some men may
            learn more of the rash policy of the world from family and
            friends, in the few opening years of life, than others who pass
            their whole time among courts and statesmen. It is not the
            largeness of the landscape that informs us, but the power of
            vision.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The “ Analyst” came into the world from the head of its
            author, like Minerva, without any apparent gestation. Its
            observation was not the less acute nor its knowledge the less
            wise. It discusses serious questions of morals, character and
            studies, with but few errors of judgment for the hand of time
            to correct, and none of the heart. There were some traces
            of bookishness in it, of course. It was evident that the writer had read Hazlitt, and the moralist. There was a smack
            of this good relish in the style, nor was the author disposed
            to withhold his acknowledgements. But with all this there
            was abundant self reliance, ample indication of original
            power, and no trace of what Mr. Poe calls American cribbage.
            The method of the book was inferior to the matter—a good
            sign and a comparatively rare one in our native literature.—
            Not that rudeness and awkwardness are commendable things
            in themselves, or that it is not a higher proof of genius, as in
            the case of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that the just conception
            should mould the just style, but that the matter is the more
            essential thing of the two, and that a charlatan and preten-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>der may secure the one, the outward, by care or thievery, but
            cannot pass off any false claim to the inner. Much as Mr.
            Jones has since written, though he has gained greater scope
            and maintains a longer flight, and attained considerable
            skill, yet a defect of manner still occasionally mars his wri-tings. He cannot feign a sentiment, or write out of his
            element. It is only on a subject of which his heart is full
            that he writes very clearly and without impediment. Should
            any man write on any other ? Certainly not in the Millen-nium, but should not is changed into must, while money con-tinues to be so essential an article as it is at present, and
            magazines pay by the page.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The next literary appearance of our author, was in a se-ries of papers in DR. HAWKES’ Church Record on the old En-glish Literature, undertaken in pursuance of the constant
            ever-present aim of that distinguished divine to do all in his
            power, by the pulpit, education, the press, for liberal studies.
            There appeared week after week for more than a year
            sketches of old divines, like Donne, Fuller and Jeremy Tay-lor, and the later Barrow, South, Berkeley and Sterne ; bio-graphies of lzaak Walton’s Saints, and many others as good
            and worthy, sketches of the sacred poets Quarles and Crashaw, and a few narratives of men after the writer’s own heart,
            like Steele and Felton. These papers are now inaccessible
            to the general reader, and good as MSS. for all publishing
            purposes. They should be reset, an omission here and there
            supplied, and “ written in a book”—a book that would form
            a choice companion to the library, useful as D’Israeli’s miscel-lanies for its facts, and more interesting inasmuch as it has
            more heart. Books of this kind, a mixture of the critical, bi-ographical and personal, will always have their charm with
            the educated as well as the novices in letters. We take up
            one of these papers, and it is as winning and uniting as the
            eloquent conversation of a friend pointing out to us that
            which is among the richest of all treasures, an unopened mine
            of wealth in the library. Blessings on these takers-down
            of misappreciated volumes, these openers of the ponderous
            jaws of unread folios !

         <p>Let those who would see more of our author, read the pa-pers signed J. in “ Arcturus” and look over a file of the “ Bos-ton Miscellany’’ and the “ De-mocratic Review,” in the December number of which is a paper on Children’s Books
            which is a very fair and right Honourable picture of the wri-ter’s mind.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The characteristics of Mr. Jones’s writings are a fine vein
            of sentiment, manly, delicate, and unerring in knowledge and
            tone of truth, and a sagacious critical acumen which is gui-ded by the heart not the head, and hence, like the remarks
            of the child of nature in Mrs. Inchbald’s tale, seems some-times very odd among the plausibilities and conventialisms
            of the world. This writer is so very odd as sometimes to
            speak exactly what he thinks, however strangely the matter
            may stare out on the page among the polished devices of
            modern typogaphy. Many of his remarks, it must be con-fessed, would read better (to most people) a hundred years
            hence in an autobiography, when this personal matter both of
            praise and censure offends no one, than at the present day.
            His writings are to be read with a mental comment and due
            consideration of the individual character that lurks beneath.
            There is a worldly tact in criticism seemingly fair and full
            —some would call it ingeniously plausible—which is the
            beau ideal of the craft that he seldom reaches. He is ear-nest, vigorous, dogmatic, and when he gets out of the range
            of his sympathies and experience, sometimes wrong. His
            affections are first of all with the true authors of sentiment,
            Sterne, Goldsmith, Mackenzie, Jean Paul and Dickens.—

         <p>
            
         </p>
         <p>Harmony of style as the index of harmony of feeling and
            the passions is his delight. He cares more for the natural
            unstudied traits of character, developed in harmony of prose
            or poetical numbers, as in a song or sonnet, than in the lof-tier flights of the muse. He never talks in his criticisms of
            a constructive work of art. The Drama and the Epic are
            out of his range. He reads the minor poets and essayists, and
            is content with perfect beauty in miniature without a thought
            of the great masters. He, perhaps, undervalues their native
            labors, if we may infer this from the neglect of them in his
            various criticisms. He is not a constructive critic, a phrase
            which he would use in reference to his treatment of Ameri-can Literature. That is to say, he does not attempt to se-lect the elements of the future and build up a school of na-tionality. He looks upon literature and books as personal
            affairs. If he is hit and pleased, he says so—but there is
            much that does not touch him.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Criticism and its opportunities after all afford but an in-sufficient means of developing our author’s character. He
            has humour, feeling, acute discrimination seen and acknow-ledged by his intimates, but what does a stranger know of
            them. He reads his articles, perhaps, with indifference, and
            complains that the critic’s measure is a foot rule out of all
            proportions. It is no foot rule at all. Yet we can conceive
            of others, skilled in the honest language of nature, who de-tect the character of the writer, who feel when he is at
            home and speaking from himself, and who set aside the oc-casional job work as “ leather and prunella.” With such our
            critic will gain a deep and permanent reputation. It is a
            customary phrase, with these good and true men, “I al-ways read an article in the magazines that bears the name
            of William A. Jones.”	D.

         <p>STREET SWEEPING.
            
         </p>
         <p>At the crossings of our principal streets during the last
            month or two of muddy weather, little foreigners, girls and
            boys with naked feet, have been busily employed with
            stumpy brooms, clearing a passage for the Israelites out of
            Wall street, and others, to pass over the black sea of our
            highways, dry-shod. These foreign children seem to do this
            on purpose to reproach our Native American corporation and
            street-inspectors; for they do not look as though they enjoyed
            a salary, and I have rarely seen anybody drop them a penny.
            It must be pure benevolence or pure waggishness in these
            little creatures, which leads them to this cruel employment
            at this season of the year. How red their feet look ! It is
            one of the most beautiful contrasts conceivable, to see a little
            girl of the tender age of seven or eight years in the depth of
            winter, without a shoe or stocking upon her feet, sweeping
            the mud from a crossing, at the risk of being crushed beneath
            the wheels of an Omnibus, that a stout hearty man, in dou-ble-soled boots and a thick coat, may step over without soil-ing his leather. And then to see the little creature hold up
            her hand and ejaculate “ please give me a penny to buy me
            some bread,” while the gentleman walks off very stiffly and
            buttons up his coat closer, to keep out the wind, without
            heeding the prayer of the pretty little scavenger; and then to
            see how cheerfully she will fall to her work again, and
            nothing daunted by her ill success, make the same appeal to
            the same kind of man again the next minute ! Some of these
            children must pick up at least a five-pence in the run of a
            very wet day. But we have a misgiving at the heart that
            they do not always earn that magnificent sum. A little palefaced urchin ran after us the other day, and begged for a pen-ny, just to encourage him, he had been sweeping all day, and
            had not received a penny.

         <p>Original Poetry.
            THE EPITAPH.
            What means this glosing epitaph,
            Unless its errand be to shame,
            As with a mocking devil’s laugh,
            The frail delusion of such fame
            As but embalms an empty name ?
            As columns, when the roof is gone
            Which they were reared to hold on high,
            Are merely idle shafts of stone
            Which, forced to tell an endless lie,
            Do but deride the passer-by ;—
            So stand these legends in Death’s halls:
            Vain figures on a dial-plate
            Whereon no gnomon’s shadow falls ;
            Poor inch-deep characters, that prate
            Of Empire over Time and Fate.
            When eye, and tongue, and heart are null.
            What profits then the laurel wreath
            Twined loathsome round a grinning skull ?
            Food crammed between a corpse’s teeth
            To win a deeper sneer from Death !
            O high Ambition ! can there be
            An epitaph in league with Time ?
            Is life a ship’s track in the sea ?
            Are all these hopes and aims sublime
            Mere architecture of frail rime ?
            Doth God implant for worse than naught
            This huge desire of memory? Cannot some monument be wrought,
            Which from its moveless height shall see
            The pyramids’ last obsequy ?
            To be a glimpse of summer sent
            Into the bleak hearts of the poor;
            To make God’s sunshine evident,
            By opening Eden’s humble door
            To souls where darkness reigned before;
            To make this cloudy life a part
            Of the eternal grace beyond;
            
         </p>
         <p>To forge the vague dreams of the heart
            Into a mighty sceptre-wand
            Whose touch makes freemen of the bond;
         </p>
         <p>Methinks a life thus spent should rear
            A monument in Fate’s despite,
            Whose epitaph would grow more clear
            As Truth’s sun rose and scattered light,
            Full and more full, from Heaven’s glad height.
            Let it be graven on my tomb :—
            “ He came and left more smiles behind,
            One ray he shot athwart the gloom,
            He helped one fetter to unbind,
            Men think of him and grow more kind."

            A STREAMLET.
            Sings ever thus this clear rejoicing stream,
            That rising in the green hills far away,
            
         </p>
         <p>Through all the starry night, and sunny day,
            Glides calmly on, “like sweet thoughts in a dream,"
            Through rural Talleys sparkling in the gleam
            Of many-colored flowers, and ever gay
            With songs of summer birds, and merry play
            Of laughing children, on whose faces beam,
         </p>
         <p>Their natural birth-right, joy and innocence.
            Like thine, glad stream ! oh, might my journey be!
            To all, some little good would I dispense,
            Ever pursue with a glad voice, like thee,
            My way unto the end, then vanish hence,
            Without a murmur, in the great salt sea!

         <p>The Principles and Practice of Obstetric Medicine and Sur-gery, in reference to the process of Parturition, with 100 illustrations, on Steel and Wood. By Francis H. Ramsbotham, M. D.,
            Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, &amp;c. Second edition,
            enlarged. London : John Churchill, 1844.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We do not notice this important work to make its merits
            known to the profession, or the public, but to point out one
            of the many evils which we inflict upon ourselves, by deny-ing to foreign authors the right to control their own works.
            In books of this class, it is of the last importance, not less
            to the student than to the author, that their publication
            should be superintended by himself or his agent. If they
            are worth having at all, it is important that they should be
            had correctly. The author states his grievances, arising
            from our system of republication, very quietly but forcibly,
            in the preface of the second edition of his work.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>" Very soon after the book was published in England, it was also
            edited, with lithographic drawings, at Philadelphia ; and, although it
            cannot but be a source of gratification to an author, to consider his
            observations worthy of being dressed in a new garb, and circulated
            over the Western hemisphere, still, I think I have some reason to
            complain of the mode in which this has been done, in the present in-stance. It was put forth without the name of any ostensible Ameri-can editor, merely with the notification of its being 'the first Ameri-can edition, revised,’ as though I had myself superintended it, and
            sanctioned its appearance. And the revision consists in the omission
            of some of my annotations, and all the Appendix, except the article
            on ‘ Suspended Animation,’ which is subjoined to one of the pages ;
            with the introduction, also, of numerous typographical errors, some
            of them completely changing the sense of the passage, and others so
            glaring as to lend in no small degree, to bring the writer into ridicule.
            I look upon this as a just cause for animadversion ; for if our transat-lantic brethren choose to appropriate to themselves our publications,
            they should, at the least, reprint them as they appear here, and use
            such ordinary care that the character of the work may not suffer in
            their hands. 14 New Bond street. Oct. 1844.”

         <p>AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IN ART.—The “Art Union,” a
            monthly paper, published in London, contains the following
            singular announcement.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Our readers will, perhaps, remember that, several months ago, we
            announced a remarkable discovery, by which, in a few days, a large
            and elaborate line-engraving might be so accurately copied that there
            should be no perceptible difference between the original and the copy:
            that an engraving on steel or copper might be produced from an im-pression of the print—the original plate never having been seen by the
            copyist; and that the steel plate so produced should be warranted to
            yield from 10,000 to 20,000 impressions. We slated also, that it was
            stated to us, that the producer would undertake to supply a Bank of
            England note so exactly copied that the person who signed and issued
            it should not be able to swear which was the original and which the
            copy.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We have resolved to test this (alleged) invention ; and have placed
            in the hands of the party referred to a foreign print (the plate never
            having been in England), and selected a subject which may be seen
            in many shop windows at this moment—so that any person may com-pare the copy with the original. A proof has been laid before us in
            an unfinished state,—not, therefore, altogether satisfactory, but still,
            we think, so wonderful a production that we feel justified in anticipa-ting its complete success—at least in so far as to give one of them
            with each number of the Art-Union for January. Our subscribers
            will then be as well able as ourselves to judge of it. We shall say
            how many we have printed, and communicate all we know on the
            subject.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>At present we can only say, that within seven days after we placed
            a proof of the print in the hands of the party referred to, he placed in
            our hands the copy of it, on the steel; that the original engraving was
            the work of at least a year ; and that the copy is already so marvellously accurate that we are much disposed to have faith in his pledge that, when finished,
            we shall not be able to distinguish the original
            proof from a proof of the copy, of which he undertakes to furnish
            between 10,000 and 15,000 impressions, if we need them.”
         </p>
         <p>We shall receive a copy of the promised engraving by
            the next steamer, and will inform our readers more about it hereafter.
            ENGLISH OPINIONS OF AMERICAN ARTISTS.—The November
            “Art Union,” contains the following notice:
            “PAINTINGS BY AMERICAN ARTISTS.—A few painlines by American
            
         </p>
         <p>Artists have been sent to this country, as tests with a view to deter-mine whether contributions from our brethren on the other side of the
            Atlantic wonld be favorably received and generously criticised in
            England. We have seen these examples at the agency-office of
            Messrs. Wiley and Putnam, in Waterloo-place. They possess considerable merit, and are evidence that the Arts are progressing in Ameri-ca ; but they are not of a nature to “ tell’’ in an exhibition-room. We
            shall rather withhold the opinion we are asked to give until we have
            more sufficient opportunities to warrant judgment. But we feel per-fectly sure that no apprehension need be entertained of undue or unfair
            treatment if really good works be sent to our galleries here ; at least,
            there will be no attempt to lessen the merit they possess by placing
            them disadvantageously before the critic. We should regard such a
            course as in the highest degree disgraceful. We cannot but add, however, that, to obtain honors beside the productions of British Artists,
            the works must be more meritorious than those we have heretofore
            seen.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This is very cautious, and apparently friendly: but as we
            do not know what the works were, or by whom executed,
            we cannot well judge of the Editor's motives in withholding
            the opinion which, it seems, he was requested to give. But
            we can hardly approve of this begging the opinions of Bri-tish critics on the merits of American productions. An
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>American artist should be content with the approbation of
            his own countrymen, and if he should fail to obtain that, he
            can hardly hope to be better received in a foreign country.
            The works of an American painter must needs be subjected
            to a very severe test in London. The greatest disadvantage
            they would labor under would be a want of sympathy in the
            critic. Pictures are as much imbued with national peculiarities as books, or any other productions which require
            expression, and these cannot be appreciated justly by strangers. The same authority in speaking of Henry Inman’s
             portraits of Wordsworth and Dr. Chalmers, pronounces them
            perfect likenesses, and says that they may vie with the best
            productions of the best British Artists. We never had any doubt that Mr. Inman would
            meet with success in England;
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>his style is essentially of the English school; and from the
            judgment pronounced upon his works, we may judge of
            their standard of excellence. There can be little question
            that we can boast of better painters in the United States
            than can be found in England. We understand that Mr.
            Inman has sent for his family to join him, which looks like
            his receiving good encouragement in his profession.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Carlyle’s Preface to Emerson’s Essay.—A year or two
            ago, one of Carlyle’s books, Past and Present, was published
            in Boston for the benefit of the author. It was prefaced by
            a few brief, but telling words, from Mr. Emerson, stating the
            circumstances of its publication, and begging American pub-lishers to be honest for once, and allow the author to receive
            the benefit of his own labours. The appeal was heeded by
            some of our publishers, but disregarded by one at least, who
            immediately issued a cheap edition of the work, which must
            have diminished, very seriously, the author’s profits. Mr.
            Carlyle has now done the same good turn for Mr. Emerson
            in London, and we trust with better success than followed
            the appeal of Mr. Emerson here. We should be exceedingly mortified to be compelled to acknowledge that we had
         </p>
         <p>
            less honesty here than in England, but we shall be glad, for
            humanity's sake, to find an instance of honesty somewhere.
            The following is Mr. Carlyle’s preface. It is a biting sa-
            -tire on “ the trade.”
            “ Here is a new volume of Essays by Emerson; concerning which I
            am to certify, that this English edition of them seems to be correctly
            
         </p>
         <p>printed; that the English Publisher is one appointed by the Author
            himself, and is under contract with him as to the pecuniary results.
            To Emerson’s readers in England, I am to certify so much ; leaving the
            inference from it to their own honourable and friendly thought. To
            unauthorized reprinters, and adventurous spirits, inclined to do a little
            in the pirate line, it may be proper to recall the known fact, which
            should be very present to us all, without recalling, that theft in any
            sort is abhorrent to the mind of man;—that theft is theft, under what-ever meridian of longitude, in whatever ' nation,’ foreign or domestic,
            the man stolen from may live ; and whether there be any treadmill or
            gallows for his thief, or no apparatus of that kind ! such suggestion
            may, perhaps, have its weight with here and there an incipient adven-turous spirit, meditating somewhat in the piccaroon or pirate line, and
            contribute to direct him into better courses; who knows ? For other
            spirits, no longer open to such suggestions, the present Publisher trusts
            that he has suggestions of a much more appropriate, intelligible, and
            effectual kind in readiness, if needed.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Very happily, the Author himself is not, in his economies, depen-dent on this claim now made for him, or on any such ; yet it will be
            handsome in the British nation to recognize it a little ! The labourer
            is worthy of his hire. Yes; and he that brings us (not in his sleep, fancy !) new
            fire from the Empyrean—new tidings of such,—he too,
            one would imagine, is worthy that we should leave him the exiguous
            sixpence a copy, which falls to his share in the adventure, and not
            steal it from him !
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ More, on this rather paltry department of the business, I had not
            to say; and to touch on any other department of it was not in my com-mission at present. I will wish the brave Emerson a fair welcome
            among us again; and leave him to speak with his old friends, and to
            make new.	T. Carlyle.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This is an admirable plan ; probably every English author
            whose works are worth reprinting in this country, has some
            friend among our own authors, who might do for him what
            these essayists have done for each other. We hope that
            somebody else may be induced to try it, and who knows, but
            an international copyright might thus be established without
            the aid" of Congress. But in all such cases the price of the
            book, should be sufficiently low to destroy any very great
            temptation to dishonesty. While we are persuading men to
            be honest, it will be well not to tempt them to be otherwise.

         <p>The Drama.
            
         </p>
         <p>WE can afford but little space in our Journal to dramatic
            affairs. Indeed, we believe there are few things which the
            public cares so little about, as the gossip of the Theatres.
            Whether Miss Somerville was perfect in the character of
            Clara, or Mr. Stanley dressed becomingly in the part of Duke
            Aranza, cannot particularly concern any body but those im-portant personages themselves. But we intend, nevertheless,
            to devote a portion of our columns to the amusements of
            this city, and the Theatres will, of course, be included among
            them. Whatever interests the people is the legitimate ob-ject of our study, and the less creditable the object may be,
            the greater is the necessity of its being looked after. Dra-matic entertainments were never popular on this side the
            Atlantic. We frequently hear the palmy days of the
            Drama spoken of, but we should be at a loss to name them.
            The same, with a very slight qualification, may be said of
            England. In France it has always been different. The
            French have a love for dramatic representations, which the
            English have not. Since the days of Queen Elizabeth, the
            Theatre has always been in disrepute. Any species of
            amusement, which the professedly religious feel themselves
            compelled to avoid, can never be esteemed popular. It is the
            religious sentiment of a country which gives the key note to
            its morals; and whatever lacks the approval of the best
            minds in a nation, must at last come to naught. The Thea-tre has long, always rather, been under the ban of what the
            world calls good men. Though Doctor Johnson went to
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>London with a play in his pocket, and with a player for a
            companion, yet he soon got himself clear from the Theatre,
            and began to teach morals. He felt that it was a disreputa-ble connexion ; and yet the Theatre was more respectable in
            his day, than it ever was before or since. Garrick was the
            greatest dramatic genius that the English stage ever posses-sed ; and while he lived he helped to render it popular, but
            he had no sooner left it, than the stage began to fall. The
            Kembles did nothing towards supporting it, but rather helped
            to hasten its downward progress, by loading it with mum-meries and machinery. Mere respectability of character
            adds nothing to the respectability of a profession. Nothing
            short of genius can do any thing for a calling which is not in
            itself respectable. A dolt-head and a genius are alike in the
            pulpit. It is the profession which confers respectability upon
            them. People go to hear one as readily as the other. Ac-cordingly we find that the church remains the same, let
            its ministers be what they may. But the stage goes up
            or down with the characters of those who tread it. When
            Kean appeared, though a man of bad morals, yet, being a
            genius, the drama seemed to revive ; and it sunk as soon as
            he was gone.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>With us the stage has never been indigenous. There have
            been but few American actors, and not one American dramatist. The whole atmosphere of our Theatres is essentially
            English. All the plays present English scenes, English
            characters, English thoughts, delivered in English accents.
            The music, too, is all foreign, and when you enter the doors
            of one of our play-houses, you appear to have stepped into
            another country. If a cockney should fall asleep in the
            Haymarket and awake in the Park Theatre, he would be
            hardly conscious of a change. There are no greater difficulties attending success in the dramatic profession than in any
            other, and if it were popular or respectable, we should have
            an American stage, as we have an American bar, an American pulpit, and an American press. Mr. Forest has done
            well for himself, but he has done nothing for his profession
            in this country. If he were a man of genius, the stage
            would have been in better repute among us, since he appeared upon it. Instead of rising, it has gradually fallen in public
            estimation since his first appearance. We do not pretend to
            argue for or against the stage; but simply to give our views
            of its actual condition. Those who decry the Theatre most
            loudly, are generally persons who never visit one, and know
            nothing about it. There are four or five Theatres in New
            York, which, to exist at all, must be frequented by a great
            number of people ; and these frequenters of the Theatre are
            generally young persons whose minds are in the fittest condition to receive impressions. It is very plain, then, that the
            professed philanthropist should look into this matter, and if
            he finds that the theatre cannot be abolished, it is his duty
            to strive to render it as little injurious as possible, and by
            sometimes visiting it, learn to counteract its influences. We
            shall hereafter give a report of the Theatres in their turn.

         <p>Italian Opera house.
            
         </p>
         <p>Our Italian company have struggled through the slough
            of despond, and, by the means of Semiramide, have risen
            to the bright heaven of success. This most charming work
            of Rossini was produced on the 3d instant, to a very crowded
            house. It has been repeated since then three times, and on
            each occasion to still increasing audiences.
         </p>
         <p>The Opera of Semiramide has always been considered
            one of the finest compositions of the great Italian Maestro.
            
            
         </p>
         <p>It abounds with passages of great beauty; the concerted
            pieces, duos, quartettes, etc., etc., are exquisite specimens of
            the author’s style. The instrumentation is brilliant, inge-nious, and varied, displaying
            great knowledge of effect in
            the happy combinations to produce light and shade. The
            chief characteristic of the music is extreme difficulty, which
            pervades all the roles equally. The music, however, to our
            taste, lacks depth and intensity of sentiment,—it is superficial, and inflated ; even the most popular of its melodies
            being overloaded with fioriture. There is not, in the whole
            range of musical composition, a work which more severely
            tests the education of singers, than the one under notice.
            It is written with admirable fidelity, for the genius of the
            particular voices, namely: The pure soprano, contralto,
            tenor, and bass. Whether it was wise to attempt such a
            composition with the company at present in this city, must
            be a subject for after reflections.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The Opera of Semiramide was composed some twentytwo or three years ago, Madame Colbran taking the princi-pal role. It was written at a period when he could produce
            four or five, and even six, Operas in the year, with perfect
            facility. What an inexhaustible imagination must Rossini
            have possessed in his youth !
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The plot of the Opera has been so frequently detailed in
            the daily papers, that we will spare our readers the trouble
            of re-perusing it, and will proceed at once to notice the per-formance.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Borghese is in no way equal to the music of Semiramide.
            She is deficient in power and compass. Her mezza voce is of
            the thinnest possible quality, and to produce even a moderate
            power, she is compelled to resort to false intonation: indeed,
            to speak the truth, we never heard in the range of any voice
            so much disagreeable and faulty intonation. Her style is ex-tremely ornate, but correctness is too frequently sacrificed
            for brilliancy, and good taste is immolated at the altar of
            popular gullibility. What would be otherwise pure and good
            in her method, is disfigured by that senseless vibration of the
            voice, which Mdlle. Borghese uses on every note and in every
            situation. The tendency of her voice to sharpen on all the
            upper notes, is painfully evident in this opera, and must in-crease still further, if she persists in the practice of forcing
            her voice beyond its natural power. We must condemn in
            the strongest terms, the unartistlike liberties which she takes
            with the ideas of the composer ; we believe that we do not
            exaggerate when we say that she did not sing in the whole
            opera eight consecutive notes as set down for her. We consider
            this altogether inexcusable. The beautiful scena (accompa-nied by chorusses of females) “ Bel raggio lusinghier' was
            probably her best performance on each occasion.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Madame Pico has not the range of a pure contralto voice,
            in consequence of which the music has to be transposed
            higher to accommodate her compass. This practice of trans-position is always an injury to the continuity of the idea of the
            author, the key of the various pieces being chosen always
            with a reference to the whole work. It also breeds confusion
            in the orchestra, rendering it difficult and sometimes impos-sible for the particular wind instruments to execute with ef-fect, or even in tune, the passages set down for them. Should
            this confusion be observed by the audience, the singer is ne-ver to blame, but all the indignation is vented upon the in-nocent orchestral performers.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Setting aside the want of compass and also the want of
            power of voice, we cordially award much praise to Madame
            Pico. With one or two exceptions she adhered faithfully to
            her author, and sung with much feeling and depth of passion.
            Her execution is finished and artistical, and she seldom inter-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>lards her music with extraneous ornaments. Her intonation
            is seldom faulty, but her intervals are sometimes so incorrect-ly taken, that we are almost inclined to attribute the mis-takes to the want of a true ear. This error was particularly
            evident in the andante movement of her duett with Borghese
            in the second act—“ Giorno d'orrore,”—in the third bar of
            which she made the sequences fifths instead of sixths; also in
            the thirty-fifth and fifty-third bar, she sang G natural instead
            of G sharp on each occasion. These are a few out of many
            errors which we could point out if we had space. Although
            this andante has been encored every time, it was, beyond a
            doubt, the worst performed piece in the Opera. Both ladies
            sang out of tune, the one sharp and the other flat, more espe-cially in their interpolated cadence. But it is a pretty move-ment, and tickles the ear. Pico cannot be compared in any
            way with Borghese as an actress; her manner is constrained,
            her action awkward, and her walk ungraceful in the extreme.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It would be a charity if the character of Idreno were
            omitted from the opera. Signor Perogzi is altogether incom-petent to sing any of the music. In proof of our assertion
            we would merely say, that he only took part in such con-certed music as was necessary to the action of the opera; and
            that what he did sing he altered to suit his voice, to conceal
            the inflexibility of his vocal organ, or its want of education.
            He omitted the Aria Ah ! dov e il cimento, also the Aria La
            speranza piu soave.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Signor Valtellina gave us real pleasure by his masterly
            performance of Assur. He is the only artist among the com-pany of whom we can truly say that he respected his au-thor. His music is exceedingly florid and difficult, and its
            compass ranges very high for a bass voice, but he sang it in
            fine taste, with good emphasis and passionate energy, and in
            short in admirable style. He occasionally sang flat, but the
            fault was more with the high range of the music, than with the
            singer. His acting, too, was bold, energetic, and artist-like.
            He is undoubtedly the feature of the opera.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Signor Meyer acquitted himself in a very creditable manner. He is always correct in his music, and were he to edu-cate his voice and subdue its somewhat harsh and grating
            quality, he would be a still more efficient member of the
            company.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The chorusses were indifferently well performed. Some
            were omitted which we think ill judged, as they form a relief to the numerous successive solos. In the Coro di Sacerdoti, which is a grand and effective piece, the whole of the
            beautiful movement for the male voices, in A minor, was
            omitted. We should be glad to know why ?
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The performance of the band has somewhat improved
            since the first night, but even now it is by no means worthy
            of its distinguished members. The only redeeming points in
            the overture were the solos, by Messrs. Kyle and Groenevelt.
            These gentlemen, with Mr. Weise on the Oboe, are truly admirable throughout the opera. They are artists in point of
            execution, taste and undeviating correctness. The orchestra
            is imperfect. It wants more bass, another Oboe, and more
            brass.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The chief fault in the performance is the entire absence
            of the pianissimo, and the consequent impossibility of a
            forte or even a sforzando. This is a great error and should
            be corrected immediately.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The scenery is very beautiful, particularly the last; the
            dresses are in good keeping, and in short the whole getting
            up of the piece is highly creditable to the management.
         </p>
         <p>The company commence a new engagement next week,
            we understand.

         <p>From the Courier and Enquirer, July 27, 1844.
            GOLDSMITH’S GEMS OF PENMANSHIP.—The Chirographic art is
            much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, and
            Mr. Goldsmith may well claim to be considered at its head. The
            volume before us exhibits more taste and ingenuity, and higher proofs
            of manual dexterity than we have ever seen before.

         <p>GOLDSMITH’S GEMS OF PENMANSHIP.—We have seen the original, as
            executed by his own hand, and a more beautiful, and indeed a more
            wonderful display of the power of that little instrument which is said
            to be “ more potent than the sword,” we never witnessed before.

         </p>
         <p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL will differ from any of the weekly Peri-odicals now published in this city, as it will be made up entirely of
            original matter, consisting of Essays, Criticisms on Art and Literature,
            Domestic and Foreign Correspondence, and Literary and Scientific
            Intelligence.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Illustrations will be given as often as good original Designs can
            be procured, and drawings and plans of all new public buildings that
            have either elegance or novelty to recommend them to notice. Par-ticular attention will be given to this department, and no pains spared
            to make it worthy of patronage.

         <p>Efficient aid has already been secured in the services of some of the
            best writers in the country ; but it is hoped that a free channel be-ing opened through which true-hearted men may “ let loose their
            thoughts,” will be the means of drawing out some of the slumbering
            talent amongst us which has not yet been seen afloat on the surface of
            our periodical literature.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The Broadway Journal will espouse the cause of no political party, but will hold itself free to condemn or approve any men or meas-ures, that a patriotic regard for the welfare of the country may dictate.
            It will be printed on fine paper with clear type, in the Octavo form of
            16 pages, double columns.
