         <p>During this dusty weather there can hardly be a more agree-; able theme to dilate
            upon than that of Fountains. There is a deliciously cool and dripping sound in the
            mere name. Our Broadway Fountains are the delight of the whole city, and
            considering how little they owe to art, they must be considered the cheapest pleasure that could be provided for the enjoyment of the
            people. If it were possible to render a fountain altogether hideous and distasteful,
            the proprietors of Bowling Green and Union Square would have succeeded to a miracle.
            We have heard a story in respect to that in Bowling-Green, for the correctness
            of which we cannot vouch, although it seems to wear the appearance of truth. It is said that the artist who made the designs for the rock-work of that
            fountain, went raving mad as soon as he had completed his drawings; giving birth
            to so grand an idea entirely prostrated his mental powers, and his imagination has
            ever since been a wreck. We have seen a good many plans, and heard a good many suggestions for improving the Park Fountain, but we trust that it may
            forever be left in its present pure and simple state. Architecture
            can do nothing to beautify it; a single column of sparkling water rising from the
            ground to the height of forty or fifty feet, presents an appearance of simple
            grandeur and beauty that art can never improve. When there is a scanty supply of
            water, marble basins, Neptunes, dolphins and rivergods help to increase the
            effect and make a grand show; but with an abundance of water any accessories, which
            are not in themselves beautiful, will only tend to destroy the simple majesty of a
            column of pure water. The fountain in Union Square looks, at times, not to speak
            irreverently, like a mere squirt when compared with its majestic brother in the Park. The fountains in London and Paris are among the chief ornaments of those
            cities. In London there are but three or four, which will not compare with ours
            ; those that have been recently erected in Trafalgar Square are maintained at a very
            great expense, but are very poor things. They are made of red granite highly
            polished, and are in themselves very beautiful specimens of workmanship; they
            stand in the centre of a large stone basin, on a level with the Square, and consist
            of a granite pedestal with four heads of dolphins projecting therefrom, and
            supporting a tazza ten feet in diameter and another above of five feet, in the centre of which is something like a fire plug from which issues the water to the
            height of four or five feet. The resemblance of these fountains to dumb-waiters with
            the tops knocked off has given occasion to a good many witticisms among the cockneys
            who love nothing in this world, next to a lord, better than a joke, even though
            it be at their own expense. We have never seen these fountains, but they are said by
            amateurs and artists to be intensely ugly in their appearance. The water for their
            supply is procured from two wells sunk to the depth of three hundred and
            ninety-five feet from the surface, and at a distance of three hundred and eighty feet
            from each other. The water, after it has played through the jets, instead of being
            allowed to run to waste, is conveyed back to the engine house and again pumped
            up to the reservoir. Besides these two fountains in Trafalgar Square there are but
            two other small jets in London, one in St. James’ Park, and one in the Temple
            Gardens, which Boz has immortalized in Martin Chuzzlewit as the trysting place
            of Tom Pinch’s sister and John Westlock. In Paris there are nearly seventy fountains,
            many of them of very great beauty, and all of them are large and elaborately
            decorated. With our proverbial love for grand names, no sooner had the Croton
            been introduced into our city than it was immediately dubbed the City of Fountains,
            but it will be a long time before we become as well entitled to the appellation as
            Paris. The Fountains in the Place de la Concorde are two in number, and are made
            of elaborately chased bronze from the same design. The lower basin of each is
            circular, of stone, fifty-two feet in diameter. In the centre is a group of colossal
            seated statues representing Ocean deities, and above an elaborately enriched
            plateau, twenty feet diameter, in the middle of which a group of children and swans surround the ornamental support of a reversed tazza of ten feet
            diameter, in the centre of which issue jets from a centre flower. At the
            circumference of the lower basin there are six full-sized figures representing
            Tritons and Naiads, holding each a fish or a drill, from which, by a beautiful arrangement, water is thrown inwards into the large tazza above. By
            this arrangement and the addition of numerous smaller jets, a great diversity of
            effect is produced, giving an idea of breadth and a pleasing appearance of
            complexity, while the annoyance of a scattered shower of spray is avoided. The
            effect of these fountains when viewed from a short distance is extremely
            beautiful. Many of our readers are aware of the beauty of the magnificent vista, which, commencing at the Chamber of Deputies, comprises, in a perfectly
            straight line, the Bridge of Louis XVI, the two Fountains and the statues of the
            Place de la Concorde, the Obelisk of Luxor, the avenue of columns formed by the
            buildings of the Garde Meuble, and terminates with the beautiful church of the Madeleine. If there be another vista in the world that can rival this, it is that which intersects it at right angles, and which, commencing at
            the centre gate of the Tuilleries with its innumerable statues, includes the
            Obelisk of Luxor, at the intersection with the former vista, the grand Avenue of
            the Champs Elysees, and terminates at the vast triumphal arch of the Barriere de
            l’Etoile. Those only who have seen these incomparable views of fountains, statues,
            foliage, porticos, vases, orange trees, gilded balustrades and marble terraces,
            can have even a faint idea of their magnificence and beauty.
         </p>
         
         <p>Long may it be before our own metropolis presents a vista to be compared with these; we neither desire to see an accumulation of private wealth, nor to bear
            any portion of the taxes which would be indispensable to create them. While we have
            the Hudson and East rivers, the Battery, and the Bay, and the Croton in our
            streets, we have a succession of vistas from the foot of every street that crosses
            the city, of greater beauty and natural magnificence than any that art has given to
            Paris and London. The Fountain at Chatsworth, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, is the highest in the world, and by way of distinction is
            called the “Emperor." It consists, like our Park Fountain, of a single vertical jet
            rising from the surface of a lake, but to the height of two hundred and sixty-seven
            feet. The 
            reservoir is a natural lake at an elevation of three hundred and eighty-
            one feet. The next highest fountain in the world, is that of Wilhelm’s-hoeh, in Hesse
            Cassel, which plays one hundred and ninety feet. One of the Fountains at St. Cloud
            rises one hundred and sixty feet. The spire of Trinity church is, or will be two
            hundred and eighty feet; by comparison the grandeur of these magnificent jets will in
            a degree be realized.
         </p>
         
         <p>Before we leave this subject of fountains, we will add a short extract from Savage
            Landor on the absurdity of elevating the statue of a hero on the top of a high
            column, as a hint to the many projectors of monuments to Washington, but for the
            special eye of Mr. Crawford and Mr. Catherwood. The satire is very pointed and
            highly polished; and shows the absurdity, very clearly, of putting up a statue out of
            sight on top of a tall pillar.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lysides, a young Athenian, has just returned to us from a voyage in Thrace. . . .
            But Lysides will appear to you to have assumed a little more than the privileges of a
            traveller, in relating that the people have so imperfect a sense of religion as
            to bury the dead in the temples of the Gods, and the priests so avaricious and shameless as to claim money for the permission of this impiety. ... He
            told us furthermore of a conqueror to whom a column has been erected, sixty cubits
            high, supporting his effigy in marble! Imagine the general of an army standing
            upon a column sixty cubits high to show himself! A crane might do it after a victory
            over a pigmy; or it might aptly represent the virtues of a rope dancer, exhibiting how little he was subject to dizziness. I will write no more
            about it, for I begin to think some pretty Thracian has given poor Lysides a love
            potion, and that it has affected his brain a little. . .
         </p>
         
         <p>“The mistake is really ludicrous. The column you must have perceived at once, was
            erected not to display the victor, but the vanquished. A blunder very easy for an
            idle observer to commit. Few of the Thracians, I conceive, even in the interior, are so utterly ignorant of Grecian arts, as to raise a statue
            to such a height above the ground, that the vision shill not comprehend all the
            features easily, and the spectator see and contemplate the object of his admiration
            as nearly and in the same position as he was used to do in the Agora.”—Pericles and Aspasia.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is so long since the attempt was first made to build a monument to the memory of Washington in this city; the plans presented to the public
            have been so numerous and so magnificent; the patriotism, as manifested in
            resolutions and speeches at public meetings, so praiseworthy; the subscriptions have
            been so extensive and the results of all have been so small; that we have long
            since given up all expectation of ever seeing a Washington Monument in New York. The
            tittle plaster casts, from the very beautiful and appropriate model by Mr. Kneeland, we fear will be the only memento to the memory of Washington,
            that New York will ever erect.

         <div class="head">MAGAZINE-WRITING—PETER SNOOK.</div>
         
         <p>In a late number of the Democratic Review, there appeared a very excellent paper (by
            Mr. Duyckinck) on the subject of Magazine Literature—a subject much less thoroughly comprehended here than either in France or in England. In America
            we compose, now and then, agreeable essays and other matters of that character—but we have not yet caught the true Magazine spirit—a thing neither to be
            defined nor described. Mr. Duyckinck’s article, although piquant, is not altogether
            to our mind. We think he places too low an estimate on the capability of the Magazine paper. He is inclined to undervalue its power—to limit unnecessarily its province—which is illimitable. In fact it is in the
            extent of subject, and not less in the extent or variety of tone, that the French and
            English surpass us, to so good a purpose. How very rarely are we struck with an
            American Magazine article, as with an absolute novelty— how frequently the foreign
            articles so affect us! We are so circumstanced as to be unable to pay for elaborate compositions—and, after all, the true invention is elaborate.
            There is no greater mistake than the supposition that a true originality is a
            mere matter of impulse or inspiration. To originate is carefully, patiently, and
            understandingly to combine. The few American Magazinists who ever think of this
            elaboration at all, cannot afford to carry it into practice for the paltry prices offered them by our periodical publishers. For this and other glaring
            reasons, we are behind the age in a very important branch of literature—a branch which, moreover, is daily growing in importance—and which, in the end
            (not far distant) will be the most influential of all the departments of Letters.
         </p>
         
         <p>We are lamentably deficient not only in invention proper, but in that which is, more strictly, Art. What American, for instance, in penning a criticism, ever
            supposes himself called upon to present his readers with more than the exact stipulation of his title—to present them with a criticism and something beyond? Who thinks of making his critique a work of art in
            itself—independently of its critical opinions?—a work of art, such as are all the
            more elaborate, and most effective reviews of Macaulay. Yet these reviews we have
            evinced no incapacity to appreciate, when presented. The best American review
            ever penned is miserably ineffective when compared with the notice of Montagu’s
            Bacon—and yet this latter is in general a piece of tawdry sophistry, owing every thing to a consummate, to an exquisite arrangement—to a thorough and just sufficiently comprehensive diffuseness—to a masterly climacing of
            points—to a style which dazzles the understanding with its brilliancy—but not
            more than it misleads it by its perspicuity —causing us so distinctly to comprehend that we fancy we coincide—in a word to the perfection of Art—of all the
            Art which a Macaulay can wield, or which is applicable to any criticism that a
            Macaulay could write.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is, however, in the composition of that class of Magazine papers which come,
            properly, under the head of Tales, that we evince the most remarkable deficiency in
            skill. If we except first Mr. Hawthorne—secondly, Mr. Simms—thirdly Mr. Willis—and fourthly, one or two others whom we may as well put mentally
            together without naming them—there is not even a respectably skilful tale-writer on
            this side the Atlantic. We have seen, to be sure, many very well-constructed
            stories—in dividual specimens—the work of American Magazinists; but these specimens have invariably appeared to be happy accidents of construction; their authors, in subsequent tales, having always evinced
            an incapacity to construct.
         </p>
         
         <p>We have been led to a comparison of the American with the British ability in
            tale-writing, by a perusal of some Magazine papers, the composition of the author of
            “Chartley” and “The Invisible Gentleman.” He is one of the best of the English
            journalists, and has some of the happiest peculiarities of Dickens,
            whom he preceded in the popular favor. The longest and best of his tales, properly so
            called, is “Peter Snook,” and this presents so many striking points for the
            consideration of the Magazinist, that we feel disposed to give an account of it in
            full.
         </p>
         
         <p>Peter Snook, the hero, and the beau ideal of a Cockney, is a retail linen-draper in
            Bishopgate street. He is of course a stupid and conceited, although at bottom a very good little fellow, and “always looks as if he was frightened.” Matters
            go on very thrivingly with him, until he becomes acquainted with Miss Clarinda
            Bodkin, “a young lady owning to almost thirty, and withal a great proficient in the
            mysteries of millinery and mantua-making.” Love and ambition, however, set the little
            gentleman somewhat beside himself. “If Miss Clarinda would but have me,” says
            he, “we might divide the shop, and have a linen-drapery side, and a haberdashery and
            millinery side, and one would help the other, There’d be only one
            rent to pay, and a double business—and it would be so comfortable too!” Thinking
            thus, Peter commences a flirtation, to which Miss Clarinda but doubtfully responds.
            He escorts the lady to White Conduit House, Bagnigge Wells, and other genteel
            places of public resort—and finally is so rash as to accede to the proposition
            on her part, of a trip to Margate. At this epoch of the narrative, the writer observes that the subsequent proceedings of the hero are gathered from
            accounts rendered by himself, when called upon, after the trip, for explanation.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is agreed that Miss Clarinda shall set out alone for Margate—Mr. Snook following her, after some indispensable arrangements. These occupy
            him until the middle of July, at which period, taking passage in the “Rose in June,”
            he safely reaches his destination. But various misfortunes here await
            him,—misfortunes admirably adapted to the meridian of Cockney
            feeling, and the capacity of Cockney endurance. His umbrella, for example, and a large brown paper parcel, containing a new pea-green coat and flower-patterned embroidered silk waistcoat, are tumbled into the water at the landingplace, and Miss Bodkin forbids him her presence in his old
            clothes. By a tumble of his own, too, the skin is rubbed from both his shins for
            several inches, and the surgeon, having no regard to the lover’s cotillon
            engagements, enjoins on him a total abstinence from dancing. A cock-chafer, moreover,
            is at the trouble of flying into one of his eyes, and (worse than all) a tall military-looking shoemaker, Mr. Last, has taken advantage of the linen-draper’s delay in reaching Margate, to ingratiate himself with his
            mistress. Finally, he is cut by Last and rejected by the lady, and has nothing left for it but to secure a homeward passage in the “Rose in June.”
         </p>
         
         <p>In the evening of the second day after his departure, the vessel drops anchor off
            Greenwich. Most of the passengers go ashore, with the view of taking the stage to the
            city. Peter, however, who considers that he has already spent money enough to no
            purpose, prefers remaining on board. “We shall get to Billingsgate,” says he, “while
            I am sleeping, and I shall have plenty of time to go home and dress, and go into the
            city and borrow the trifle I may want for Pester and Company’s hill, that comes due the day after to-morrow.” This determination is a source of much
            trouble to our hero, as will be seen in the sequel. Some shopmen who remain with him
            in the packet, tempt him to unusual indulgences in the way first, of brown
            stout, and secondly, of positive French brandy. The consequence is, that Mr. Snook falls, thirdly, asleep, and fourthly, overboard.
         </p>
         
         <p>About dawn on the morning after this event, Ephraim Hob- son, the confidential clerk
            and factotum of Mr. Peter Snook, is disturbed from a sound sleep by the sudden
            appearance of his master. That gentleman seems to be quite in a bustle, and
            delights Ephraim with an account of a whacking wholesale order for exportation
            just received. “Not a word to anybody about the matter, exclaims Peter, with unusual
            emphasis. “It’s such an opportunity as don’t come often in a man's life-time.
            There’s a captain of a ship—he’s the owner of her too; but never mind! there
            an’t time to enter into particulars now, but you’ll know all by and bye—all you have
            to do, is to do as I tell you—so come along!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Setting Ephraim to work, with directions to pack up immediately all the
            goods in the shop, with the exception of a few trifling articles, the master avows
            his intention of going into the city, “to borrow enough money to make up Pesters bill
            for to-morrow.” “I don’t think you’ll want much, Sir,” returns
            Hobson with a self-complacent air. “I’ve been looking up the long-winded ’uns you
            see, since you’ve been gone, and have got Shy’s money and Slack’s account, which we’d
            pretty well given up for a bad job, and one or two more. There,— there’s
            the list—and there’s the key to the strong box, where you’ll find the money, besides
            what I’ve took at the counter." Peter at this seems well pleased, and shortly
            afterwards goes out, saying, he cannot tell when he’ll be back, and giving directions that whatever goods may be sent in during his absence, shall
            be left untouched till his return.
         </p>
         
         <p>It appears that, after leaving his shop, Mr. Snook proceeded to that of Jobb,
            Flashbill &amp; Co. (one of whose clerks, on board the “Rose In June,” had been very
            liberal in supplying our hero with brandy on the night of his ducking) looked over a
            large quantity of ducks and other goods, and finally made purchase
            of “a choice assortment,” to be delivered the same day. His next visit was to Mr.
            Bluff, the managing partner in the banking-house where he usually kept his cash. His
            business now was to request permission to overdraw a hundred pounds for a few
            days.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Humph,’ said Mr. Bluff, “money is very scarce but—Bless me!—yes—it’s he! Excuse me
            a minute, Mr. Snook, there’s a gentleman at the front counter whom I want
            particularly to speak to—I'll be back with you directly.” As he uttered these words,
            he rushed out, and, in passing one of the clerks on his way forward, be
            whispered—“Tell Scribe to look at Snook’s account, and let me know directly.” He then went to the front counter, where several people were waiting to pay and
            receive money. “Fine weather this, Mr. Butt. What! you’re not out of town like the
            rest of them?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No," replied Mr. Butt, who kept a thriving gin-shop, “no, I sticks to my
            business—make hay while the sun shines—that's my maxim. Wile up at night—I up early
            in the morning.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The banker chatted and listened with great apparent interest till the closing of a
            huge book on which he kept his eye, told him that his whispered order had been
            attended to. He then took a gracious leave of Mr. Butt, and returned back to the
            counting-house with a slip of paper, adroitly put in his hand while passing, on which
            was written, "Peter Snook, Linen Draper, Bishopgate Street—old account—increasing gradually—balance £153 15s. 6d.—very regular.” “Sorry
            to keep you waiting, Mr. Snook,” said he, “but we must catch people when we can.
            Well, what is it you were saying ( you wanted us to do?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I should like to be able to overdraw just for a few days,” re- plied Peter.</p>
         
         <p>“How much?”</p>
         
         <p>“A hundred.”</p>
         
         <p>“Won’t fifty do?”</p>
         
         <p>“No, not quite, sir.”</p>
         
         <p>”Well, you’re an honest fellow, and don’t come bothering us often, so I
            suppose we must not be too particular with you for this once.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Leaving Bluff, Mr. Snook hurries to overtake Mr. Butt, the dealer in spirits, who
            had just left the banking-house before himself, and to give that gentleman an order
            for a hogshead of the best gin. As he is personally unknown to Mr. Butt, he
            hands him a card on which is written “Peter Snook, linen and muslin ware house, No.—,
            Bishopgate street within,” etc. etc., and takes occasion to mention that he purchases at the recommendation of Mr. Bluff. The gin is to be at Queenhithe
            the same evening. The spirit-dealer, as soon as his new customer
            has taken leave, revolves in his mind the oddity of a linen draper’s buying a hogshead of gin, and determines to satisfy himself of Mr. Snook’s responsibility by a personal application to Mr. Bluff. On reaching the
            bank, however, he is told by the clerks that Mr. Bluff, being in attendance upon a committee of the House of Commons, will not be home in any reasonable time—but also that Peter Snook is a perfectly safe man. The gin
            is accordingly sent; and several other large orders for different goods, upon other houses, are promptly fulfilled in the same manner. Meantime Ephraim is busily engaged at home in receiving and inspecting the invoices of the
            various purchases as they arrive, at which employment he is occupied until dusk,
            when his master makes his appearance in unusually high spirits. We must here be
            pardoned for copying some passages:
         </p>
         
         <p>“Well, Ephraim,” he exclaimed, “this looks something like business! You havn’t had such a job this many a day! Shop looks well now, eh?”</p>
         
         <p>“You know best, sir,” replied Hobson. “But hang me if I a’nt frightened. When we
            shall sell all these goods I’m sure I can’t think. You talked of having a
            haberdashery side to the shop; but if we go on at this rate, we shall want another
            side for ourselves; I’m sure I don’t know where Miss Bodkin is to be put.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“She go to Jericho!” said Peter contemptuously. “As for the goods, my boy, they’ll
            be gone before to-morrow morning. All you and I have got to do is to pack ’em up: so
            let us turn to and strap at it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Packing was Ephraim’s favorite employment, but on the present occasion
            he set to work with a heavy heart. His master, on the contrary, appeared full of life
            and spirits, and corded boxes, sewed up trusses, and packed huge paper parcels with a
            celerity and an adroitness truly wonderful.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why, you don’t get on, Hobson,” he exclaimed; “see what I’ve done! Where’s the ink-pot?—oh, here it is!” and he proceeded to mark his packages with his initials and the letter G below. “There,” he resumed, “P. S. G.; that’s for me at Gravesend. I’m to meet the Captain and owner there; show the
            goods —if there’s any he don’t like shall bring ’em back with me; get
            bills—bankers’ acceptances for the rest; see ’em safe on board then—but not
            before, mind that Master Ephraim! No, no, keep my weather eye open as the men say on
            board the Rose in June. By the bye, I havn’t told you yet about my falling overboard
            whap into the river.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Falling overboard!" exclaimed the astonished shopman, quitting his
            occupation to stand erect and listen.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ay, ay,” continued Peter—“see it won’t do to tell you long stories now. There—mark
            that truss, will you? Know all about it some day. Lucky job though—tell you that: got this thundering order by it. Had one tumble, first going off, at
            Margate. Spoilt my peagreen—never mind—that was a lucky tumble too. Hadn't been
            for that, shouldn't so soon have found out the game a certain person was playing with
            me. She go to Jericho!”
         </p>
         
         <p>But for the frequent repetition of this favorite expression, Ephraim Hobson has since declared he should have doubted his master’s identity during the whole of that evening, as there was something very singular
            about him; and his strength and activity in moving the bales, boxes, and trusses,
            were such as he had never previously exhibited. The phrase condemning this, that, or
            the other thing or person to “go to Jericho,” was the only expression that he uttered, as the shopman said, “naturally,” and Peter repeated that
            whimsical anathema as often as usual.
         </p>
         
         <p>The goods being all packed up, carts arrive to carry them away; and, by half-past
            ten o’clock, the shop is entirely cleared, with the exception of some trifling
            articles to make show on the shelves and counters. Two hackney coaches are
            called. Mr. Peter Snook gets into one with a variety of loose articles which
            would require too much time to pack, and his shopman into another, with some more. Arriving at Queenhithe, they find all the goods previously sent, already
            embarked in the hold of a long-decked barge which lies near the shore. Mr. Snook
            now insists upon Ephraim's going on board and taking supper and some hot rum and
            water. This advice he follows to so good purpose that he is at length completely
            bewildered, when his master, taking him up in his arms, carries him on shore,
            and there setting him down, leaves him to make the best of his way home as he
            can.
         </p>
         
         <p>About eight the next morning, Ephraim awaking, of course in a sad condition both of body and mind, sets himself immediately about arranging the appearance
            of the shop “so as to secure the credit of the concern.” In spite of all his
            ingenuity, however, it maintains a poverty-stricken appearance;—which
            circumstance excites some most unreasonable suspicions in the mind of Mr.
            Bluff’s clerk, upon his calling at ten with Pester &amp; Co’.s bill, (three hundred
            and sixteen pounds, seventeen shillings) and receiving, by way of payment, a check
            upon his own banking house for the amount—Mr. Snook having written this check
            before his departure with the goods, and left it with Ephraim. On reaching the bank,
            therefore, the clerk inquires if Peter Snook’s check is good for three hundred and
            sixteen pounds odd, and is told that it is not worth a farthing, Mr. S. having overdrawn for a hundred. While Mr. Bluff and his assistants are
            conversing on this subject, Butt, the gin-dealer, calls to thank the banker for having recommended him a customer—which the banker denies having done.
            An explanation ensues and “stop thief!” is the cry. Ephraim is sent for and
            reluctantly made to tell all he knows of his master’s proceedings on the day before—by which means a knowledge is obtained of the other
            houses who (it is supposed) have been swindled. Getting a description of the barge
            which conveyed the goods from Queenhithe, the whole party of creditors now set
            off in pursuit.
         </p>
         
         <p>About dawn the next morning they overtake the barge a little below
            Gravesend—when four men are observed leaving her, and rowing to the shore in a skiff.
            Peter Snook is found sitting quietly in the cabin, and, although apparently a little
            surprised at seeing Mr. Pester, betrays nothing like embarrassment
            or fear.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah, Mr. Pester, is it you? Glad to see you, sir! So you’ve been taking a trip out
            o’ town, and are going back with us? We shall get to Billingsgate between eight and
            nine, they say; and I hope it won’t be later, as I’ve a bill of yours comes due
            to-day, and I want to be at home in time to write a check for it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The goods are also found on board, together with three men in the hold, gagged and
            tied hand and foot. They give a strange account of themselves. Being in the employ of
            Mr. Heaviside, a lighterman, they were put in charge of “The Flitter” when she
            was hired by Peter Snook for a trip to Gravesend. According to their orders they took
            the barge in the first instance to a wharf near Queenhithe and helped to load
            her with some goods brought down in carts. Mr. Snook afterwards came on board,
            bringing with him two fierce looking men, and “a little man with a hooked nose” (Ephraim.) Mr. S. and the little man then “had a sort of jollification” in the cabin, till the latter got drunk and was carried ashore. They then proceeded down the river, nothing particular occurring till
            they had passed Greenwich Hospital, when Mr. S. ordered them to lay the barge
            alongside a large black sided ship. No sooner was the order obeyed than they were
            boarded by a number of men from said ship, who seized them, bound them, gagged
            them and put them in the hold.
         </p>
         
         <p>The immediate consequence of this information is, that Peter is bound, gagged, and put down into the hold in the same manner, by way of retaliation, and
            for safe keeping on his way back to the city. On the arrival of the party a meeting
            of the creditors is called. Peter appears before them in a great rage and with
            the air of an injured man. Indeed his behavior is so mal apropos to his situation as entirely to puzzle his interrogators. He accuses the whole party of a
            conspiracy.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Peter Snook,” said Mr. Pester solemnly, from the chair, “that look does not become
            you after what has passed. Let me advise you to conduct yourself with propriety. You
            will find that the best policy, depend on't.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“A pretty thing for you, for to come to talk of propriety!” exclaimed
            Peter; “you that seed me laid bold on by a set of ruffians, and never said a word,
            nor given information a'terwards! And here have I been kept away from business I
            don't know how long, and shut up like a dog in a kennel; but I look upon’t you
            were at the bottom of it all—you and that follow with the plumpudding face, as blowed me up about a cask of gin! What you both mean by it I can't
            think; but if there’s any law in the land, I’ll make you remember it, both of
            you—that’s what I will!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Snook swears that he never saw Jobb in his life except on the occasion of his
            capture in “The Flitter,” and positively denies having looked out any parcel of
            goods at the house of Jobb, Flashbill &amp; Co. With the banker, Mr. Bluff, he acknowledges an acquaintance—but not having drawn for the two hundred and seventy pounds odd, or having ever overdrawn for a shilling in his
            life. Moreover he is clearly of opinion that the banker has still in his hands more than a hundred and fifty pounds of his (Mr. Snook's) money. He also
            designates several gentlemen as being no creditors of his, although
            they were of the number of those from whom large purchases had been made for the “
            whacking” shipping order, 
            and although their goods were found in the “Flitter.” Ephraim is summoned, and testifies to all the particulars of his master’s return, and
            the subsequent packing, cart-loading and embarkation as already told—accounting for
            the extravagances of Mr. Snook as being “all along of that Miss Bodkin.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Lor’, master, hi’s glad to see you agin,” exclaimed Ephraim. “Who’d ha’ thought as
            ’twould come to this?” 
         </p>
         
         <p>“Come to what?” cried Peter. “I’ll make ’em repent of it, every man Jack of ’em,
            before I’ve done, if there’s law to be bad for love or money!”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ah, sir,” said Ephraim, “we’d better have stuck to the retail. I was afraid that
            shipping consarn wouldn’t answer, and tell'd you so, if you recollect, but you
            would’nt barken to me.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“What shipping concern?” inquired Peter, with a look of amazement.</p>
         
         <p>“La! master," exclaimed Ephraim, “it aint of any use to pretend to keep
            it a secret now, when every body' knows it. I didn't tell Mr. Pester, though, till
            the last, when all the goods was gone out of the shop, and the sheriff’s officers had
            come to take possession of the house.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Sheriff’s officers in possession of my house!” roared Peter. All the goods gone out
            of the shop! What do you mean by that you rascal? What have you been doiug in my
            absence?” And he sprang forward furiously, and seized the trembling shopman by
            the collar with a degree of violence which rendered it difficult for the two
            officers in attendance to disengage him from his hold.
         </p>
         
         <p>Hereupon, Mr. Snap, the attorney retained by the creditors, harrangues the company
            at some length, and intimates that Mr. Snook is either mad or acting the madman for
            the purpose of evading punishment. A practitioner from Bedlam is sent for, and
            some artifices resorted to—but to no purpose. It is found impossible to decide upon
            the question of sanity. The medical gentleman, in his report to the creditors,
            confesses himself utterly perplexed, and, without giving a decision, details the particulars of a singular story told him by Mr. Snook
            himself, concerning the mode of his escape from drowning alter he
            fell overboard from the “Rose in June.” “It is a strange unlikely tale to be sure,”
            says the physician, “and if his general conversation was of that wild, imaginative,
            flighty kind which I have so often witnessed, I should say it was purely ideal;
            but he appears such a plain-spoken, simple sort of a person, that it is difficult to
            conceive how he could invent such a fiction.” Mr. Snook’s narration is then told, not
            in his very words, but in the author’s own way, with all the particulars obtained from Peter's various recitations. We give it only in brief.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon tumbling overboard, Mr. Snook (at least according to his own story) swam
            courageously as long as he could. He was upon the point of sinking, however, when an
            oar was thrust under his arm, and he found himself lifted in a boat by a “dozen
            dark-looking men.” He is taken on board a large ship, and the captain, who is a droll
            genius, and talks in rhyme somewhat after the fashion of the wondrous Tale of Alroy,
            entertains him with great cordiality, dresses him in a suit of his own clothes,
            makes him drink in the first place, a brimmer of “something hot,” and afterwards
            plies him with wines and cordials of all kinds, at a supper of the most magnificent description. Warmed in body and mind by this excellent cheer, Peter
            reveals his inmost secrets to his host, and talks freely and minutely of a thousand
            things; of his man Ephraim and his oddities; of his bank account; of his great
            credit; of his adventures with Miss Bodkin; of his prospects in trade; and
            especially of the names, residences, etc. etc., of the wholesale houses with
            whom he is in the habit of dealing. Presently, being somewhat overcome with wine, he
            goes to bed at the suggestion of the captain, who promises to call him in season
            for a boat in the morning, which will convey him to Billingsgate in
            full time for Pester and Co’s note. How long he slept is uncertain—but when he awoke a great change was observable in the captain’s manner, who was somewhat
            brusque, and handed him over the ship’s side into the barge where he was discovered by the creditors in pursuit, and which he was as- sured would convey him
            to
            Billingsgate.
         </p>
         
         <p>This relation, thus succinctly given by us, implies little or nothing. The result, however, to which the reader is ingeniously led by the author, is, that
            the real Peter Snook has been duped, and that the Peter Snook who made the various purchases about town, and who appeared to Ephraim only during the
            morning and evening twilight of the eventful day, was, in fact, no other person
            than the captain of “the strange black-sided ship.” We are to believe that, taking
            advantage of Peter’s communicativeness, and a certain degree of personal resemblance to himself, he assumed our hero’s clothes while he slept, and
            made a bold and nearly successful attempt at wholesale peculation.
         </p>
         
         <p>The incidents of this story are forcibly conceived, and even in the hands of an
            ordinary writer would scarcely fail of effect. But, in the present instance, so
            unusual a tact is developed in the narration, that we are inclined to rank “Peter
            Snook” among the few tales which (each in its own way) are absolutely faultless. It is a Flemish home-piece of the highest order —its merits lying in
            its chiaro ’scuro—in that blending of light and shade and shadow, where nothing is
            too distinct, yet where the idea is fully conveyed—in the absence of all rigid
            outlines and all miniature painting—in the not undue warmth of the coloring—and
            in a well subdued exaggeration at all points—an exaggeration never amounting to
            caricature.

         <p>Ill-fated and mysterious man!—bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination,
            and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in fancy I behold thee! Once more
            thy form hath risen before me!—not—oh not as thou art—in the cold valley and
            shadow—but as thou shouldst be—squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in
            that city of dim visions, thine own Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the
            sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and
            bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I repeat it—as thou
            shouldst be. There are surely other worlds than this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other speculations than the speculations of the
            sophist. Who then shall call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of
            life, which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?
         </p>
         
         <p>It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the Ponte di Sospiri,
            that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I speak. It is with a
            confused recollection that I bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember—ah! how should I forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge of
            Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the
            narrow canal.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had sounded the fifth
            hour of the Italian evening. The square of the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and
            the lights in the old Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home
            from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the
            mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon
            the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the
            sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single oar, lost
            it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery, and we were consequently left
            to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller
            channel. Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the
            windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep
            gloom into a livid and preternatural day.
         </p>
         
         <p>A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen
            from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal.
            The quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own gondola
            was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking
            in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas! only within
            the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace, and
            a few steps above the water, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever
            since forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite—the adoration of all Venice—the
            gayest of the gay—the most lovely where all were beautiful—but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of that fair child,
            her first and only one, who now deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in
            bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in
            struggles to call upon her name.
         </p>
         
         <p>She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of
            marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than half loosened for the night from
            its ball-room array, clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her
            classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and
            gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but
            the mid-summer and midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very
            vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.
            Yet—strange to say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave
            wherein her brightest hope lay buried—but riveted in a widely different
            direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think, the statliest building in all Venice—but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when
            beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark, gloomy niche, too, yawns right
            opposite her chamber window—what, then, could there be in its shadows—in its
            architecture—in its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di
            Mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not remember
            that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror, multiplies the images
            of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far off places, the wo which is close at
            hand?
         </p>
         
         <p>Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate, stood, in full
            dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was occasionally occupied in
            thrumming a guitar, and seemed ennuyc to the very death, as at intervals he gave
            directions for the recovery of his child. Stupified and aghast, I had myself no
            power to move from the upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek,
            and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down
            among them in that funereal gondola.
         </p>
         
         <p>All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing
            their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There seemed but little hope for
            the child; (how much less than for the mother!) but now, from the interior of that
            dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the Old
            Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a
            cloak, stepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of
            the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant
            afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp,
            upon the marble flagstones by the side of the Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the
            drenching water, became unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered
            to the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very young man, with
            the sound of whose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.
         </p>
         
         <p>No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive her child—she
            will press it to her heart—she will cling to its little form, and smother it with her
            caresses. Alas! another's arms have taken it from the stranger—another’s arms have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace!
            And the Marchesa! Her lip—her beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her
            eyes—those eves which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes,
            tears are gathering in those eyes—and see! the entire woman thrills throughout the
            soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of the marble countenance, the
            swelling of the marble Bosom, the very purity of the marble feet, we behold
            suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder
            quivers about her delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver
            lilies in the grass.
         </p>
         
         <p>Why should that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer—except that, having
            left,
            in the eager haste and terror of a mother’s heart, the privacy of her own boudoir, she has neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers,
            and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venitian shoulders that drapery which is
            their due. What other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing?—for
            the glance of those wild appealing eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing
            bosom?—for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?— that hand which fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of
            the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low—the singularly low tone
            of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu?
            “Thou hast conquered”—she said, or the murmurs of the water deceived me—“thou hast
            conquered—one hour after sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be!”
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">***** *</div>
         
         <p>The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace, and the
            stranger, whom I now recognised, stood alone upon the flags. He shook with
            inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola. I could
            not do less than offer him the service of my own; and he accepted the civility.
            Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we proceeded together to his residence,
            while he rapidly recovered his self-possession, and spoke of our former slight
            acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The person of
            the stranger—let me call him by this title, who to all the world was still a
            stranger—the person of the stranger is one of these subjects. In height he might have
            been below rather than above the medium size: although there were moments of
            intense passion when his frame actually expanded and belied the assertion. The light,
            almost slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity
            which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which
            he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more dangerous
            emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity—singular, wild, lull, liquid eyes,
            whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which a forehead of unusual
            breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivory—his were features than which I
            have seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those
            which all men have seen at some period of their lives, and have never afterwards
            seen again. It had no peculiar—it had no settled predominant expression to be
            fastened upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten—but forgotten
            with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind. Not that the
            spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw its own distinct image
            upon the mirror of that face—but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of
            the passion, when the passion had departed.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in what I thought
            an urgent manner, to call upon him very early the next morning. Shortly after
            sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of
            gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in
            the vicinity of the Rialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into
            an apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an
            actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.
         </p>
         
         <p>I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his possessions in terms
            which I had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed
            about me, I could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in
            Europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed
            around.
         </p>
         
         <p>Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still brilliantly lighted
            up. I judged from this circumstance, as well as from an air of exhaustion in the
            countenance of my friend, that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the
            preceding night. In the architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident design had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been
            paid to the decora of what is technically called keeping, or to the proprieties of
            nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon none—neither the grotesques of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the best Italian
            days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low, melancholy music, whose or
            gin was not to be discovered. The senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting
            perfume reeking up from strange convolute censers, together with mutitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire.
            The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole, through windows
            formed each of a single pane of crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a
            thousand reflections, from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts
            of molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the
            artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich,
            liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha!”—laughed the proprietor, motion ng me to a seat as I
            entered the room, and throwing himself back at full length upon an ottoman. “I see,"
            said he. perceiving that I could not immediately reconcile myself to the
            bienseance of so singular a welcome—“I see you are astonished at my apartment—at
            my statues—my pictures—my originality of conception in architecture and
            upholstery—absolutely drunk, eh? with my magnificence. But pardon me, my dear sir,
            (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for
            my uncharitable laughter, you appeared so utterly astonished. Besides, some things
            are so completely ludicrous that a man must laugh or die. To die laughing must be the
            most glorious of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More—a very fine man was Sir
            Thomas More—Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the Absurdities of
            Ravisius Textor, there is a long list characters who came to the same
            magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he musingly,
            “that at Sparta (which is now Palaeochori), at Sparta, I say, to the west of the
            citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind of socle upon which are
            still legible the letters AAZM. They are undoubtedly part of TEAAZMA. Now at
            Sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities.
            How exceedingly strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But in the present instance," he resumed, with a singular
            alteration of voice and manner, “I have no right to be merry at your expense.
            You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this,
            my little regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the same order; mere
            ultras of fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion—is it not? Yet
            this has but to be seen to become the rage—that is, with those who could afford it at
            the cost of their entire patrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such
            profanation. With one exception you are the only human being besides myself and
            my valet, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial
            precincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!”
         </p>
         
         <p>I bowed in acknowledgment: for the overpowering sense of splendor and perfume, and
            music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my appreciation of what I might have
            construed into a compliment.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around the
            apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the
            present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting tapestry for a chamber
            such as this. Here too, are some chef d'oeuvres of the unknown great—and here
            unfinished designs by men, celebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence and to me. What think you,” said
            he, turning abruptly as he spoke—“what think you of this Madonna della
            Pieta?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“It is Guido’s own!” I said with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. “It is Guido’s own!—how
            could you have obtained it?— she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in
            sculpture.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ha!" said he thoughtfully, “the Venus—the beautiful Venus?—the Venus of the
            Medici?—she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part of the left arm (here
            his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty), and all the right are
            restorations, and in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I think, the
            quintessence of all affectation. Give me the Canova! The Apollo, too!—is a copy—there
            can be no doubt of it—blind fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration
            of the Apollo! I cannot help—pity me!—I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was
            it not Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of marble?
            Then Michel Angelo was by no means original in his couplet—
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>'Non ba l’ottimo artista alcun concetto
            
            <br></br>Che uu marmo solo in se non circunscriva.'”
            
         </div>
         
         <p>It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true gentleman, we
            are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the vulgar, without being at
            once precisely able to determine in what such difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still more fully
            applicable to his moral temperament and character. Nor can I better define that
            peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other
            human beings, than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought, pervading even his most trivial actions—intruding upon his moments of dalliance—and interweaving itself with his very flashes of
            merriment—like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the
            cornices around the temples of Persepolis.
         </p>
         
         <p>I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation—a degree of nervous unction in
            action and in speech— an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all
            times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sentence whose commencement
            he had apparently forgotten, he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as
            if either in momentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must have
            had existence in his imagination alone.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian’s beautiful tragedy
            “The Orfeo,” (the first native Italian tragedy,) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in pencil. It was a passage towards
            the end of the third act—a passage of the most heart-stirring excitement—a
            passage which, although tainted with impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with
            fresh tears, and, upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my
            acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own.

            their author acquainted—afforded me little matter for surprise. I was too well aware
            of the extent of his acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in
            concealing them from observation, to be astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must confess, occasioned me no
            little amazement. It had been originally written London, and afterwards carefully
            overscored—not, however, so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing
            eye. I say this occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former conversation with my friend, I particularly
            inquired if he had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some
            years previous to her
            marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of Great
            Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than once heard, (without of
            course giving credit to a report involving so many improbabilities,) that the
            person of whom I speak was not only by birth, but in education, an
            Englishman.

         <p>“There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice of the
            tragedy—“there is still one painting which you have not seen.” And throwing aside a
            drapery, he discovered a full length portrait of the Marchesa Aphrodite.
         </p>
         
         <p>Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty. The
            same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy
            which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a
            curiously fashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth—and, scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which
            seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately
            imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman’s Bussy D'Ambois quivered instinctively
            upon my lips:
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>“He is up
            
            <br></br>There like a Roman statue! He will stand
            
            <br></br>Till Death hath made him marble!”
            
         </div>
         
         <p>“Come!” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled and massive
            silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained, together with two large
            Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. “Come!” he said abruptly, “let us drink! It is early—but
            let us drink. It is indeed early,” he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy
            golden hammer, made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise—“It is
            indeed early, but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to
            subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.
         </p>
         
         <p>“To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory
            conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vases—“to dream has been the business of my life. I have therefore
            framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have
            erected a better? You behold around you, it is trite, a medley of
            architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by antediluvian
            devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the
            contemplation of the magnificent. Once I was myself a decorist: but
            that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for ray
            purpose. Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the
            delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of
            real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.” He here paused abruptly, bent
            his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At
            length, erecting his frame, he looked upwards and ejaculated the lines of the
            Bishop of Chichester:—
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>Slay for me there! I will not fail
            
            <br></br>To meet thee in that hollow vale.
            
         </div>
         
         <p>In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself at full
            length upon an ottoman.
         </p>
         
         <p>A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into the room, and faltered out, in a
            voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words, “My mistress!—my mistress!—poisoned!—poisoned! Oh beautiful—oh beautiful Aphrodite!”
         </p>
         
         <p>Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to a sense
            of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid—his lips were livid—his
            lately beaming eyes were riveted in death. I staggered back towards the table— my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet—and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.

            <p>Fleetwood, or The Stain op Birth. A Novel of American Life. By the Author of
               Philip in Search of a Wife, &amp;c., &amp;c. New York. Burgess, Stringer &amp; Co.
               1845.
            </p>
            
            <p>A novel of American life is one of the greatest novelties in literature; and we took up “Fleetwood,” therefore, with peculiar pleasure, anticipating,
               from its winning title, an unusual treat. Novels of Irish life, Scotch life,
               Cockney life, French life, and even of Swedish and Russian life, are as plenty as
               blackberries, in our booksellers’ shops. But hitherto, nobody but Mr. Dickens and Mrs. Trollope, has made an attempt at American life.
               It certainly speaks little for the imagination of our twenty millions, that not one
               among them has been found capable of giving a sketch of their characters. We have not produced a single book which can be pointed to as containing
               an insight into the peculiarities of the national character. Mrs. Clavers has made the most successful attempt, but her sketches are confined to a very limited circle of characters. Very perfect, they are, as far as they
               reach; but our American novelist is yet in embryo, and in embryo must remain,
               until an international copy-right law shall enable the genius of the nation to
               develope itself. The author of the book before us, says in his preface, which he calls an “overture,” that twenty thousand copies of his last work were
               sold; a much greater number we fear, than were read, for we do not remember to
               have heard it named or to have seen it alluded to, by any of our critics or
               reviews. Twenty thousand copies are a monstrous edition for a novel, much larger than any of Walter Scott’s ever reached, and probably four times
               greater than either of Bulwer’s or James’ novels has ever amounted to in their
               best days. Cheap reading, we mistrust, produces cheap readers. A great majority of the books published at the present day, novels in particular, are pure
               luxuries, and a luxury to be held in any esteem must not come too cheap. If novels
               and truffles were given away, we doubt whether half the quantity of either would be devoured, that there is at present. Authors and booksellers made a terrible mistake when they introduced the cheap
               system. Nothing has saved the present race of English novelists from utter
               oblivion, but publishing in three volumes at a guinea and a half. A book needs the endorsement of a review to give it a circulating value, but who
               will waste time in reviewing a work which is shabbily printed and sold for a shilling? Mr. Cooper has lost half his popularity at home, since he
               reduced the price of his novels; but abroad where the old price is adhered to, he
               meets with the same dignified reception that he ever did. Whether such a book
               as Fleetwood would meet with a more profitable sale if the prices were greater we
               have doubts, but if the uniform price of novels were greater, we should have no
               Fleetwoods at all, but in their place works of a much higher order of merit.
            </p>
            
            <p>The sub-titles of Fleetwood are both misnomers; first there is no character in it to whom the stain of birth is fixed, and secondly it contains no
               American life, nor any other life indeed, although it contains several American names. The first chapter of the work affords a fair specimen of the
               author’s style, which is stiff and pompous,—inflated without being light, and
               dreadfully hard without any force;—it begins in this abrupt and grandiloquent
               style:
            </p>
            
            <p>“Midnight brought with it no abatement of the violence of the gale. During the day
               it had swept in eddying gusts through the broad avenues and narrow cross streets of
               the city, carrying desolation and dismay—prostrating chimneys—scattering the slates from the roofs, and making sad havoc with the wooden signs
               which adorned the districts devoted to traffic. One man, as he was passing up
               Broadway, had been knocked on the head by the shaft of a canvass awning, and
               instantly killed. Others had been severely bruised by the flying fragments, strewn at random by the blast. The dwellers on the North River
               had been appalled by the lurid aspect and the rapid swelling of that majestic
               stream. Its tortured waters would writhe and convolve into large ridges of foam, as
               if a new ocean were struggling for birth beneath its laboring surface, &amp;c., &amp;c.” Much more of similar description follows, which the
               reader will naturally suppose has something to do with the story, but it hasn’t.
               The man knocked on the head by the shaft of a canvass awning and instantly killed,
               as he was going up Broadway, is a touch of “American life,” and should be a
               caution to our citizens to get into an omnibus when wooden signs, slates and
               chimneys are “strewn at random by the blast.” “The dwellers on the North River”
               and the “shaft of a canvass awning,” are objects of which we have no very clear idea, although we are tolerably familiar with the river and with
               awnings.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the midst of this tremendous storm, the door of a house opens, “a young man
               might have been seen,”—he must have been seen, or the fact could not have been chronicled—“to issue forth unattended.” Though young women do not
               often issue forth unattended in stormy nights, it is a very common occurrence
               with young men; and we do not, therefore, see the necessity of noticing the fact.
               The young man after he has issued forth, holds this remarkable conversation with somebody who had lighted him to the door:
            </p>
            
            <p>“You had better stay, Challoner. It is a dreadful night. Gome back.”</p>
            
            <p>“No, I thank you, Winton. I shall get along very well. Good night.”</p>
            
            <p>What does the reader suppose that this young man, who had issued forth unattended at midnight, did in the midst of a pelting snow storm, when chimneys
               were flying about at random, and the waters of the North River wore convolving
               themselves into lurid aspects and so forth? We will let the author answer.
            </p>
            
            <p>“No sooner had the door closed upon him than he threw his cloak over his arm, took
               off his hat, tore open his vest, and stood with his face to the blast, as if its
               snow-laden currents were hardly strong and chilly enough to cool the fever of his
               brain. His person bared to the storm, he walked slowly on like one immersed in thought.” Now to our thinking he acted much more like one immersed in
               liquor than thought.
            </p>
            
            <p>This gentleman had just left a gambling house, where he had lost all his money,
               and having a young wife at home whose destitution he commiserates, he coolly stops
               at the door of a courtesan and requests the trifling loan of a hundred dollars of
               the bawd who keeps the house. His request is politely complied
               with, but before he reaches his own house, “as he was turning the corner of a well
               known street, (there are several in New York) a chimney was hurled into fragments
               by the blast. The scattered debris struck him violently on the head and felled
               him to the earth.” Debris is, we suppose, a new name for bricks, we know of no
               other material of which chimneys are composed. “The storm howled on, and spread its flaky winding sheet over his body; and there he was found under the
               incarnadined snow, a ghastly spectacle, by the early morning light.”
            </p>
            
            <p>This is the last of the chapter and the last of the unfortunate gentleman; we hear of him no more until the book is closing. The next
               chapter begins with a conversation between “two young men equipped for a shooting excursion,” seventeen years after the “tragical event which we have narrated.” The scene is in Connecticut near the Sound; the two
               young men are the heroes of the novel, very intimate friends, who appear
               afterwards to have had not the slightest regard for each other. As they stand conversing after the manner of Amer
               ican high life, they see a young female on the brow of a small sandy
               acclivity in the act of falling from a spirited horse, Fleetwood, the man-angel of
               the story, “darted to her relief and caught her in his arms, while her horse in his
               fright, was twisting round like—” Like what? We would bet a trifle that no
               reader, though ever so familiar with horses, could ever guess,—“like water as it
               leaves a tunnel." This young lady is the woman-angel of course, with “chiselled
               loveliness of features,” not to be described; and “long eye-lashes that curtained dark blue balls.” He and she fall in love without the slightest
               hesitation, as a matter of course; the merest tyro in novel-reading could tell that. But we regret for “American life,” that Mr. Fleetwood was guilty
               of an act which not only proves him to be either an ass or a villain, but also lets
               us into the secret of the author’s estimation of a gentleman and of his experience of “American life.” While the young lady rests in a fainting
               condition in his arms, he has the meanness, which no butcher’s boy would be guilty
               of, to kiss her lips and her cheek; and when Glenham, his companion, interrupts
               him, he requests that American gentleman to run and call a physician, to which Mr. Glenham replies, “using a school boy’s colloquial vulgarism,” as
               the author elegantly expresses it, “in what part of my eye do you see anything
               green?”
            </p>
            
            <p>Fleetwood is a young gentleman of very large fortune without a
               relative in the world, although he is a descendant of the royal families of England
               and France, all his relations having been blown up in steamboats or lost at sea.
               His father had enjoined upon him never to marry a woman of inferior birth to
               himself; but Adelaide, the heroine, proves to be the offspring of a
               left-handed connexion; in fact her mother was the keeper of the very brothel from
               whom the unfortunate gentleman, who was killed by the debris of a chimney, borrowed a hundred dollars in the first chapter. What of that? Love is not
               only, blind, but an unprincipled vagabond, and Fleetwood, under his
               directions, pays not the slightest regard to his father's injunctions, but proposes to marry Adelaide, who agrees to marry him, after fifteen
               minutes’ acquaintance. The young lady’s mother, however, puts a stop to the match
               by taking her daughter back to New York, with an intention of putting her upon
               the stage; her extremely modest and shrinking manners rendering her a capital
               subject for the display of the theatre. Augusta, the mother of the young lady, who
               still keeps up her establishment, in a “well-known street,” forms a league with
               Mr. Gordon, a rich merchant, Glenham, Fleetwood’s friend, and Count La Salle, a French gentleman, to prevent Fleetwood from marrying Adelaide, and
               to carry their purpose, they resort to practices which we trust no three
               individuals could be found in the world base enough to undertake. But quite as
               a matter of course they don’t succeed. Adelaide turns out to be the lawful
               daughter of the debris-killed gentleman and the heiress of a large fortune, which
               she bequeaths to Fleetwood and dies; he gives the money to the greatest rogue in
               the book and goes a travelling, and the book is at an end. But a letter from
               Mrs. Davenant in Paris to her friend in New York, intimates that there is probability of a match being made between Fanny Ellsler the younger, a
               Park Theatre figurante, whom Adelaide took under her protection before she died,
               and Fleetwood, who has been travelling in the East.
            </p>
            
            <p>“Fleetwood” is probably quite as good a book as many of those that issue from our
               press and are eagerly read by the young and thoughtless, doing them no more harm
               than any other merely idle employment, and we should not have selected it from a mass of flimsy things for an extended notice, had not
               the presumption of the author, in putting “a Novel of American life” in the title page, arrested our attention. American life is human life, and the
               author who aims to represent American men and women, must bear in mind the
               importance of making them appear like human beings, if he would have them pass
               current with the rest of the world.

               series will comprise some of the best Essays which have appeared this side of the Atlantic.

         <p>The Democratic Review for June, is illustrated by a portrait of M. B.
            Lamar, of Texas. It contains a long poem by Whittier; a spirited paper on Oregon, by D. D. Field; a peculiarly unintelligible essay on Emerson, by a
            “Disciple an article by J. T. Headly, and a very pleasant collection of
            miscellanies, besides reviews and critical notices.

         <p>Hunt’s Magazine, has its usual variety of excellent papers on commerce and
            political economy, and an able article on the commercial associations of France and
            England, by Henry C. Cary, of Philadelphia.
         </p>
         
         <p>The American Review contains two articles of unusual force for a magazine; the “Mystery of Iniquity,” continued from the last number, by Dr. Bacon,
            and an essay on American Letters, by Mr. Johnson, the author, we believe, of the literary notices in the National Intelligencer. The essay is written with vigor and, to a very great extent, with discrimination;
            but the writer betrays an inexcusable ignorance
            of his subject, or a very reprehensible prejudice against American authors. As a specimen of his feeling for poetry, we quote his
            concluding paragraph.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Still there is some comfort. Verse is daily getting into disrepute, which
            delights me. There is nothing of which a London or New York bookseller is so shy.
            Shortly we trust to see it abandoned to tailors and man-milliners, as congenial
            to their pursuits alone, and employed to popularize, as it is already adequately doing, patent blacking, hoarhound candy and quack medicines.
            They who rhyme upon these subjects give us hopes, for they are the only ones we see
            who are equal to their subjects.”
         </p>
         
         <p>This is decidedly cool, considering that the editor of the Re- view is himself the
            author of the longest American poem which has been published. The new Johnson has
            something of the imperative manner of his great namesake. He is evidently not
            a person to spoil a joke for relation sake. Ne sutor ultra crepidam, however. We
            regret, for the Review's sake, that so absurd an article has been admitted into its
            columns.

         <p>Another glorious landscape by George Brown has been added to the exhibition-room
            of the American Art-Union. It represents a view on the Arno, near Florence, with the
            tower of Michael Angelo in the fore-ground, and the city in the distance. It
            is in the style of the four other pictures by the same artist, which we have already
            noticed, and equals either of them in execution. As these masterly paintings belong
            to private houses, the public should not miss the opportunity of inspecting them while they remain in their present place of exhibition.

         <div class="head">MUSICAL ITEMS.</div>
         
         <p>The New Opera at Philadelphia.—We shall present to our readers next week a
            faithful account and impartial criticism of Leonora, written and composed by the
            Messrs. Fry. It being the first Opera written by an American, there is very naturally a considerable degree of excitement and interest respecting
            it. We are curious to witness the impression made by its first performance, and have therefore made arrangements to proceed to Philadelphia, in order to be present on Wednesday evening. We trust, for
            the sake of “Young America,” that we may be enabled to give a favorable report of
            the joint work of the two brothers. But, be that as it may, no one can dispute
            their claim to much merit and boldness as the pioneers on a way hitherto
            untravelled.
         </p>
         
         <p>Among the young men both in this city and in Philadelphia, there is a vast amount
            of genius and perseverance, and to their exertions will music owe its elevation in
            this country.
         </p>
         
         <p>But, while extolling the “young men,” we would on no account disparage the "old
            ones.” There are many whose large practical and theoretical knowledge, if rightly exerted, would give an impulse to music hitherto unknown; but they
            wrap themselves about with their age and their dignity, and, like the snail, keep themselves to themselves, and retire into houses which they seem ever
            to carry on their backs, lest the young men should tread upon their heels.
         </p>
         
         <p>We have thought much upon this subject, and intend very shortly to discuss it at
            length, for it is a theme rife with interest, 
            and offers matter for deep
            consideration to all those interested in the progress of musical art in the New
            World.

         <p>Concert at the Coliseum.—Mrs. Strong, Miss Pearson, Mr. Comes and Mr. Pearson,
            Sen., have formed themselves into an association for the purpose of giving Glee
            Concerts. The first one took place at the above Rooms on Tuesday last; the
            selection was attractive, consisting of some extremely beautiful glees, and some very popular melodies, harmonized Mrs. Strong's talent is well known
            to the largest portion of the musical public; she is deservedly a great
            favorite. The Concert was well attended, and the performance was highly
            creditable. Mr. H. C. Timm presided at the pianoforte.

         FOREIGN MUSICAL ITEMS.
         
         <p>Signor Marras, a tenor singer, who came out last year, has been highly successful
            in London. His capabilities are said to be of a high order. He gave a grand concert
            at the Hanover-Square Rooms. Among the five artists who assisted him, we observe
            the name of W. V. Wallace, whose triple genius as composer, violinist and
            pianist was the theme of such just eulogy in this city some two years since.
         </p>
         
         <p>Royal Society of Female Musicians’ benefit Concert, came off on the 2d ult., at
            the Hanover-Square Rooms. Mdlle. Schloss, Mrs. W. H. Seguin, Miss Poole, Miss
            Steele, Miss Sabilla, Madame Caradori Allan, Miss Dolby, and others, were the vocal contributors. Mrs. Anderson and M. Benedict played a piano-forte
            duet; M. Vieuxtemps a solo on the violin; and the Distin family a quintet on
            the Sax-horns. There was also a Mdlle. Lorenzina Mayer, who volunteered an amusing
            specimen of her skill upon the flute.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mdlle. Themar, a native of Prussia, who has been distinguished at Brussels, Spa,
            and various places on the Continent, as a pianist of the first order, has made her debut in London with great sucsess. It is said, that the astonishing
            vigor, facility, and precision of Mdlle. Themar’s execution, combined with the
            expression and finish of her performance, much of which is of her own composition, gave great satisfaction to the distinguished party, and justify
            the expectation that she will prove a star of no small magnitude, amidst the
            variety of musical talent at present collected in that metropolis.

         <p>Mr. Wilson is giving his annual delineation of Scotch songs at the Hanover-Square
            Rooms, London, where he is warmly greeted by numerous and highly respectable
            audiences.

         <p>Mr. Grattan Cooke is giving Soirees Musicales in the same place. He is assisted by
            Madame Albertazzi, Miss Hawes, Miss Rainforth, Herr Staudigl, and Signor Brizzi, and with piano-forte and concertina fantasias by Mr. Kiallmark and
            Signor Regondi. John Parry is by no means the least important person in the programmme.
         </p>
         
         <p>Madame Caradori Allan is also giving concerts in London, assisted by
            the principal members of the Italian troupe in that city.
         </p>
         
         <p>Sir Henry Bishop has resigned the conductorship of the Philharmonic concerts, and Mr. Moscheles has been engaged to conduct the remaining
            performances of the season.

         <p>The author of the letters in the Boston Atlas, who has had the rare good fortune of being on intimate terms with everybody worth knowing, is an
            Englishman who recently came to this country, named Ross. The letters have been
            attributed to Mr. Grattan the consul at Boston, but we had thought from
            reading them that they must be written by some diligent reader of the English magazines, who had never left the emporium of the Bay State.

         <div class="head">THE GRAVE OF L. E. L.</div>
         
         <p>The following graphic description of the burial place of Miss Landon, for the world will never call her Mrs. McLean, is extracted from the journal of an African cruiser, kept by an officer of our navy, and re written by
            Nathaniel Hawthorne. The “Journal” will be published by Wiley &amp; Putnam, and will
            form the leading volume of their new series of “books which are books,” by
            American authors. The “African Cruiser,” it appears is satisfied that the death of
            Mrs. McLean was purely accidental; but it is strange that no pains have ever been
            taken by her husband to put the world in possession of the facts relating to her sudden decease, and thus to silence the many vague rumors that have been
            circulated in England and America, since the occurrence of that unhappy event. Mrs.
            McLean is said to have been strongly attached to her husband, but it is hard to
            believe that the author of the Golden Violet could have felt any sympathy for a person of his mental and personal qualities. A person less likely than
            Captain McLean, to excite the admiration of an imaginative woman could hardly be
            conceived.

         <p>May 2.—Sailed for Cape Coast Castle with the evening breeze.</p>
         
         <p>3.—At Cape Coast Castle.</p>
         
         <p>The landing is effected in large canoes, which couvey passengers close to the rocks,
            safely, and without being drenched, although the surf dashes fifty feet in height.
            There is a peculiar enjoyment in being raised, by an irresistible power beneath you,
            upon the tops of the high rollers, and then dropped into the profound hollow of
            the waves, as if to visit the bottom of the ocean, at whatever depth it might be. We landed at the castle-gate, and were ushered into the castle itself, where the commander of the troops received us in his apartment.
         </p>
         
         <p>I took the first opportunity to steal away, to look at the burialplace
            of L. E. L., who died here, after a residence of only two months, and within a year
            after becoming the wife of Governor McLean. A small, white marble tablet (inserted
            among the massive grey stones of the castle-wall, where it faces the area of the
            fort) Dears the following inscription:

         <p>The first thought that struck me was the inappropriateness of the spot for a grave,
            and especially for the grave of a woman, and, most of all, a woman of poetic
            temperament. In the open area of the fort, at some distance from the castle-wall, the
            stone pavement had been removed in several spots, and re-placed with plain
            tiles. Here lie buried some of the many British officers who have fallen victims to
            the deadly atmosphere of this region; and among them rests L. E. L. Her grave is
            distinguishable by the ten red tiles which cover it. Daily, the tropic sunshine
            blazes down upon the spot. Daily, at the hour of parade, the peal of military
            music resounds above her head, and the garrison marches and counter-marches through
            the area of the fortress, nor shuns to tread upon the ten red tiles, any more than
            upon the insensible stones of the pavement. It may be well for the fallen commander
            to be buried at his post, and sleep where the reveille and roll-call may be heard, and the tramp of his fellow-soldiers echo and reecho over him.
            All this is in unison with his profession; and the drum and trumpet are his perpetual requiem; the soldier's honorable tread leaves no indignity upon the
            dead warrior’s dust. But who has a right to trample on a woman's breast! And what had
            L. E. L. to do with warlike parade? And wherefore was she buried beneath this
            scorching pavement, and not in the retired shadow of a garden, where seldom any footstep would come stealing through the grass, and pause before her
            tablet? There, her heart, while in one sense it decayed, would burst forth afresh
            from the sod in a profusion of spontaneous flowers, such as her living fancy
            lavished throughout the world. But now, no verdure Dor blossom will ever grow upon
            her grave.
         </p>
         
         <p>If a man may ever indulge in sentiment, it is over the ashes of a woman whose poetry
            touched him in his early youth, while he yet cared anything about either
            sentiment or poetry. Thus much, the reader will pardon. In reference to Mrs. McLean,
            it may be added, that, subsequently to her unhappy death, different rumors were
            afloat as to its cause, some of them cruel to her own memory, others to the conduct
            of her husband. All these reports appear to have been equally and entirely unfounded.
            It is well established here, that her death was accidental.

      <div class="piece" id="#p28">
         <div class="head">A PERFECT LADY.</div>
         
         <p>We take the following charming portrait of a very perfect woman from the last number of Coleman’s European Agricultural Tour; we know the author to be a very honest unimaginative person, or we should half suspect that he had been
            indebted to his fancy for a sitter, but he assures us that he only describes
            what he saw. We once heard Mr. Colman apologise to some ladies for using the term manure in their hearing, when conversing upon agricultural topics,
            but his beau ideal lady appears to have been afflicted with none of the squeamishness
            common among American women.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had no sooner entered the house, where my visit had been expected,
            than I was met with an unaffected cordiality which at once made me at home. In the midst of gilded balls, and hosts of liveried servants, of dazzling
            lamps, and glittering mirrors, redoubling the highest triumphs of art and taste; in
            the midst of books, and statues, and all the elegances and refinements of luxury; in
            the midst of titles, and dignities, and ranks, allied to regal grandeur— there
            was one object which transcended and eclipsed them all, and showed how much the nobility of character surpassed the nobility of rank, the beauty of
            refined and simple manners all the adornments of art and the scintillations of the
            soul, beaming from the eyes, the purest gems that ever glittered in a princely
            diadem. In person, in education and improvement, in quickness of perception, in facility and elegance of expression, in accomplishments and
            taste, in a frankness and gentleness of manners tempered by a modesty which courted confidence and inspired respect, and in a high moral tone and sentiment, which, like a bright halo, seemed to encircle the whole
            person,—I confess the fictions of poetry became substantial, and the beau ideal of my
            youthful imagination was realized.
         </p>
         
         <p>But who was the person I have described? A mere statue, to adorn a gallery of
            sculpture? a bird of paradise, to be kept in a glass case? a mere doll, with painted
            cheeks, to be dressed and undressed with childish fondness? a mere human toy, to
            languish over a romance, or to figure in a quadrille? Far otherwise; she was a
            woman in all the noble attributes which should dignify that name; a wife, a mother, a
            housekeeper, a farmer, a gardener, a dairy-woman, a kind neighbor, a benefactor to the poor, a Christian woman, ‘full of good works, and alms-deeds which
            she did.’
         </p>
         
         <p>In the morning, I first met her at prayers; for, to the honor of England, there is
            scarcely a family, among the hundreds whose hospitality I have shared, where the duties of the day are not preceded by the services of family worship;
            and the master and the servant, the parent and the child, the teacher and the taught,
            the friend and the stranger, come together to recognise and strengthen the sense of their common equality in the presence of their common Father, and to
            acknowledge their equal dependence upon his care and mercy. She was then kind enough
            to tell me, after her morning arrangements, she claimed me for the day. She first
            showed me her children, whom, like the Roman mother, she deemed her brightest jewels, and arranged their studies and occupations for the day. She then
            took me two or three miles on foot to visit a sick neighbor, and, while performing
            this act of kindness, left me to visit some of the cottages upon the estate, whose
            inmates I found loud in the praises of her kindness and benefactions. Our next
            excursion was to see some of the finest, and largest, and most  aged trees in the
            park, the size of which was truly magnificent; and I sympathized in the veneration
            which she expressed for them, which was like that with which one recalls the
            illustrious memory  of a remote progenitor. Our next visit was to the greenhouses
            and the gardens; and she explained to me the mode adopted there of managing the
            most delicate plants, and of cultivating, in the most economical and successful
            manner, the fruits of a wanner region. From the garden we proceeded to the cultivated
            fields; and she informed me of the system of husbandry pursued on the estate,
            the rotation of crops, the management and application of manures, the amount of seed
            sown, the ordinary yield, and the appropriation of the produce, with a perspicuous detail of the expenses and results. She then undertook to show me the
            yards and offices, the byres, the feeding-stalls, the plans for saving, and increasing, and managing, the manure, the cattle for feeding, for
            breeding, for raising the milking stock, the piggery, the poultryyard, the stables, the harness-rooms, the implement-rooms, the dairy. She explained
            to me the process of making the different kinds of cheese, and the general management
            of the milk, and the mode of feeding the stock; and then, conducting me into the
            baliff’s house, she exhibited to me the Farm Journal, and the whole
            systematic mode of keeping the accounts and making the returns, with which she seemed
            as familiar as if they were the accounts of her own wardrobe. This did not finish our
            grand tour: for, on my return, she admitted me into her boudoir, and showed me
            the secrets of her own admirable housewifery, in the exact accounts which she kept of
            everything connected with the diary and the market, the table, the drawing-room, and
            the servants’ hall. All this was done with a simplicity and frankness which
            showed an absence of all consciousness of any extraordinary merit: in her own
            deportment, and which evidently sprang solely from a kind desire to gratify a
            curiosity on my part, which, I hope, under such circumstances, was not unreasonable.
            A short hour after this brought us into another relation; for the dinner-bell
            summoned us, and this same lady was found presiding over a brilliant circle of
            the highest rank and fashion, with an ease, elegance, wit, intelligence, and good-humor, with a kind attention to every one’s wants, and an
            unaffected concern for every one’s comfort, which would lead one to suppose that this
            was her only and her peculiar sphere. Now, I will not say how many mud-puddles we had
            waded through, and how many dung-heaps we had crossed, and what places we
            explored, and how every farming topic was discussed: but I will say, that she pursued
            her object without any of that fastidiousness and affected delicacy which pass with
            some persons for refinement, but which in many cases indicate a weak if not a
            corrupt mind. The mind which is occupied with concerns and subjects that are worthy to occupy it, thinks very little of accessories which are of no importance. I will say, to the credit of Englishwomen,—I speak, of
            course, of the upper classes, that it seems impossible that there should exist a more
            delicate sense of propriety than is found universally among them; and yet you will
            perceive at once that their good sense teaches them that true delicacy is much
            more an element of the mind, in the person who speaks or observes, than an attribute
            of the subject which is spoken about or observed.
         </p>
         
         <p>Now, I do not say that the lady to whom I have referred was herself the manager of
            the farm; that rested entirely with her husband; but I have intended simply to show
            how grateful and gratifying to him must have been the lively interest and sympathy
            which she took in concerns which necessarily so much engaged his time and
            attention; and how the country could be divested of that dulness and ennui, so often
            complained of, as inseparable from it, when a cordial and practical interest is taken
            in the concerns which necessarily belong to rural life. I meant also to show—as
            this and many other examples which have come under my observation
            emphatically do show—that an interest in, and a familiarity with, even the most
            humble occupations of agricultural life, are not inconsistent with the highest
            refinements of taste, the most improved cultivation of the mind, and elegance, and
            dignity of manners, unsurpassed in the highest circles of society.

         <p>Castle Garden.—This well known and popular summer resort, is, we are happy to say,
            in a fair way to return with interest the liberal outlay of the proprietors. The
            price of admission has been lowered to twenty five cents—a rate recommended by us
            from the first—and the entertainments are of a character to please those persons most likely to visit the Garden, or rather Theatre. Singing, dancing,
            rope-dancing and funny monopolologues till up the passing hours; to say nothing of
            the vast area for promenading and refreshment, with the lovely walk which surrounds
            the whole, in full view of the Bay.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is one thing, however, which imperatively calls fur alteration.
            We tried every portion of the gallery, and found that in no situation could we hear
            one word of Mr. Hilt’s humorous sketches. Ladies do not like being hustled by the
            crowd below, but prefer remaining, to their own loss, in their seats in the gallery. To entertainments such as Mr. Hill presents us with, a stage should be
            erected in front of the Cupola, when every one in the house would be enabled to
            hear. This is the sole, though important, drawback to this extensive and attractive
            establishment.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Italian singers will not be re-engaged, which we think very fortunate for the
            Proprietors. They were out of place there, and could not fail to take more from the
            treasury than they would bring into it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Poor Hood is at last in “port,” as he said of himself. He died on the 7th of last
            month and was buried in Kendal Green Cemetry, a much better place for his remains
            than the "corner” in Westminster Abbey.

            <p>Splendidly and profusely embellished with about 1600 exquisitely-finished illustrations by Adams, principally from original designs by
               Chapman; to be completed in about 50 numbers, royal folio size, at 25 cents each,
               28 of which are already published: the continuation at intervals of every 10 days till finished. This sumptuous work, evincing a style of art
               unsurpassed by any edition of the Sacred Canon ever issued from the press, forms
               one of the most desirable and beautiful presents that can possibly be selected as a Sacred Token of Remembrance, and certainly far more worthy the giver and receiver than the ephemeral though gaudy works usually
               devoted to that purpose. For its extreme beauty of finish, and the richness and
               rarity of its embellishments, this volume, when complete, will far transcend
               anything of the kind extant. To render it universally acceptable, the text is the
               authorized version, given without note or comment, so that no sectarian prejudice can exist against its unlimited circulation. By taking the work in numbers choice impressions of the plates will be secured, besides the well-known advantages of economy in so costly a publication.

            <p>The extreme elegance, vigor, and boldness of conception that characterise the exquisite designs which embellish this sumptuous edition of
               Shakspeare, impart to it great artistic value. Based as this American edition is
               upon the well known English edition of Knight and Tyas, embodying the best features
               of both, it cannot fail of rankiug first among the numerous splendid monuments of
               bibliographic art to the memory of the great “monarch of the mind." To the
               lovers of the “legitimate drama,” as well as to the artist, this will prove a rich
               and luxurious book: and as early impressions possess a charm for such, their inspection of it is especially solicited, now in the freshness of its first issue. The entire number of illustrations will amount to about
               14,00! a fact of itself sufficient evidence of prodigal liberality on the part of

               as are its descriptions, it possesses a yet more exalted merit in the biblical and
               philosophical illustrations of the writer.”—United Service Magazine.

            <p>"Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The 'Realities’ of 'Eastern Travel’ are described with a vividness which invest them with deep and abiding interest; while the 'Romantic’ adventures which the

               how much he enjoyed these reliefs from the ennui of every-day life.”—Globe.

            <p>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old establishment in
               Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS published on the continent
               without the heavy expense attending their transmission through England. Each of
               these establishments will be conducted by one of his sons, under his own general
               superintendence.— This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage
               to his correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
               on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and small sums
               payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New-York. Two and a half percent will be
               allowed to all those who make a remittance with their orders.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years, possesses a
               knowledge of books and editions not often to be met with, and will be happy to give any advice and information respecting the formation of Libraries or
               Collections of Books in any particular branch of literature or science. For
               information in regard to his efficiency, he begs to refer to Messrs Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other literary characters in the United
               States, to whom he is known. Intending to devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits, his greatest pleasure will arise from sending rare
               and valuable books to his own country; and he trusts to live long enough to see in
               the United States a Library which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in
               Europe. If he can live to say, “I also assisted in its formation,” his most ardent wishes will be gratified.

            <div class="head">BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.</div>
            
            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work yet published iu this
               country. Where pupils have used this method, the most rapid advancement has been
               observed in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons,
               exercises, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they enlist
               the interests of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those
               mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when a superficial knowledge
               of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of such methods
               as Bertini’s that pupils will be enabled to read music with facility, and at the
               same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rudiments of music
               being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson is fully explained by
               marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from professional
               gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method over all others yet
