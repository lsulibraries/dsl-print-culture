            <p>A Course of English Reading, adapted to every taste and capacity,
<br/>with Anecdotes of Men of Genius.By the Rev. James Pycroft,
<br/>B. A., with additions by J. G. Coggswell. New York, Wiley &amp; Put-
<br/>nam, 1845.</p>
            <p>“Miss Jane C.,”-says Mr. Pycroft, in his preface, “divided
<br/>her in-door hours into three parts: the house-keeping andFor
<br/>dinner-ordering cares of life, claimed one part; hearing two
<br/>younger sisters say their lessons, a second part; and during
<br/>the third, and most delightful remainder, she would lock
<br/>herself up in her bed-room, and move on the marker of Rus-
<br/>sell’s ‘ Modern Europe,’ at the rate of never less than fifteen
<br/>pages an hour, and sometimes more.”</p>
            <p>It was to cure this unfortunate person of her strange mania,
<br/>that Mr. Pycroft composed the book which we have before
<br/>us. He tells us that the remedy worked well, and the lady
<br/>was cured of her disorder. But it strikes our mind that a
<br/>course of medical treatment would have been the safer experi-
<br/>ment in such a case. Mr. Pycroft, however, knew his patient,
<br/>and it appears that he prescribed wisely; but as such cases
<br/>must be exceedingly rare, we do not discover any very good
<br/>reason for his publishing his remedy, for so peculiar a dis-
<br/>ease. The disease, fortunately has never reached this country,
<br/>to our knowledge, excepting of the type Henry Russell,
<br/>which was quite a different complaint.</p>
            <p>Mr. Coggswell has added a preface to the present edition,
<br/>as well as an appendix, in which the work is highly com-
<br/>mended, and being a scholar of extensive and varied book-
<br/>knowledge, his opinion upon such a subject, must not be
<br/>lightly regarded. But, to make use of a refined vulgarism,
<br/>our own view of the work must be taken from our own point
<br/>of observation, we cannot pretend to view it from the same
<br/>altitude with the learned editor.</p>
            <p>The utmost that can be done in such an attempt as this of
<br/>Mr. Pycroft’s, is to recommend such books as have come un-
<br/>der one’s own observation; and as any one man’s observation
<br/>of general knowledge, must be extremely limited, when com-
<br/>pared with the necessities of the human mind, and his ability
<br/>to judge critically of the fitness of a work to meet the cravings
<br/>of particular classes, still narrower; it is very clear that his
<br/>labors will be of little benefit to any but those whose necessi-
<br/>ties are the same as his own. The few words of wisdom to
<br/>be written on the subject of general reading might be inscri-
<br/>bed on your thumb nail. Read only such works as give you
<br/>pleasure. This, it is true, is the burthen of our author’s in-
<br/>structions; hut it is so overlaid with gossip of one kind and
<br/>another, that the novice who reads the book for information,
<br/>Will be very likely to miss it entirely. His ideas of the worth
<br/>of historical writings are very admirable, but his recommen-
<br/>dations of particular works are of no worth. Hume, Smoll ett,
<br/>Keightly, Robertson, and Gibbon, are his staples, and they
<br/>probably form the staples of the majority in this country, who
<br/>flatter themselves that they are studying history, when they
<br/>are poring over the wordy pages of these writers. The great
<br/>defect of the book is the lack of general principles, in the
 
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>place of which we have particular instructions. But there is
<br/>much sound sense distributed through the work, which ap-
<br/>pears to less advantage for want of a proper arrangement.
<br/>There are many pious mothers, who would sooner see their
<br/>sons wasting their time in listless idleness, or engaged in
<br/>entertaining their guests at an evening party with the most
<br/>wearisome of small talk, than in reading a novel, though it
<br/>were Caleb Williams, or the Golden Ass of Apuleius. But,
<br/>Mr. Pycroft says with truth:</p>
            <p> "The lowest order of intellectual is preferable to mere physical re-
<br/>sources. A book containing but little good, has kept many a youth
<br/>from company productive of positive evil. The excitement and gross
<br/>immorality of even the worst class of the old fashioned novels is a less
<br/>pernicious stimulant than lounging night after night with a cigar to
<br/>the billiard-room. Not long since, I heard a father say: If I could
<br/>only see my boy reading Tom Thumb, I should be happy: that would
<br/>be a beginning; but he avoids a book as if it had the plague. The
<br/>habit of seeking amusement with books, is so truly valuable in con-
<br/>ducing to limit the sphere of youthful temptations, that a parent does
<br/>wisely, if he encourages it at almost any cost. Children should be
<br/>taught that books are as natural a source of fun as tops and balls.”</p>
            <p>How differently do our fathers and merchants generally
<br/>reason in regard to young men placed under their care. It
<br/>is almost an universal prejudice among merchants, that books
<br/>are unbecoming to business men. In a very large wholesale
<br/>dry goods establishment, in this city, the principal of which
<br/>was a rigidly pious man, whenever one of the clerks was
<br/>discovered with a book in his hand, in an interval of business,
<br/>he was immediately sent on some idle errand, or some unne-
<br/>cessary work as a punishment. Clerks who employ their
<br/>leisure hours in study, very rarely, if ever, become defaulters.
<br/>But the greatest number of these unfortunates have either
<br/>been the gay and dashing, who seek for amusement in thea-
<br/>tres and ball-rooms, or the sternly pious, whose source of
<br/>excitement has been found in religious assemblies.</p>
            <p>“In paying so much deference to the excitement class of readers, I
<br/>only act on the principle that if we wish to keep a child quiet, we
<br/>must give him such toys as he is in humor to play with. Children are
<br/> found of all ages; and, as Aristotle says,  'whether young in years, or
<br/> young in character, matters not for my argument;’ for doubtless, in
<br/> bis day, as in ours, children often attained to the so-called years of
<br/> discretion without being able to run alone. I say, then, those of
<br/>youthful taste and mind must be indulged in their own way, and
<br/>gradually led on, by timely encouragement, and the influence of supe-
<br/>rior minds, to mingle works of valuable information with those of
<br/>more thrilling interest. But, after all, let the taste of youth be what
<br/>it may, it is better that they should read after their own way, than
<br/>not at all.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Pycroft’s “plan” for studying any particular subject is
<br/>very good, but the “course” of study recommended by him,
<br/>must be objectionable, because he reasons from his own
<br/>tastes, while he recommends that others should follow theirs.</p>
            <p>"And for the study of History, which I will consider under the fol-
lowing divisions:</p>
            <div class="ab">HISTORY,
    <br/>  MODERN,  
    <br/>  of Great Britain ; 
    <br/>  of the Continent, Colonies, and
    <br/>  of India, America;
    <br/>  ANCIENT,
    <br/>  of Rome; 
    <br/>  of Greece;
    <br/>  of the Egyptians, Persians, &amp;c.</div>
            <p> "Divide and conquer, that is, choose one department and master it,
<br/>and you will have accomplished, in point of time and labor, much
<br/>more than a sixth part of the whole. You would do well to read the
<br/>lists of books in all these departments, before you decide. For your
<br/>decision should be deemed irrevocable, otherwise you will be continu-
<br/>ally changing, in a vain hope of escaping difficulties which really at-
<br/>tach to all.”</p>
            <p>This is the main principle of the plan in every department
<br/>of study, to divide off, and master a portion at a time, and not
    <br/>attempt to grasp an entire study at once. A very judicious,<div class="pagebreak" id="#page66"/>
    
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
and obviously necessary course, such as would naturally be
<br/>followed by any student who had a serious wish to become
<br/>tolerably well acquainted with any department of learning.</p>
            <p>The part of the book which relates to the translation of the
<br/>classics is well entitled to consideration. He candidly and
<br/>honestly admits that it is better to read Plutarch and Xeno-
<br/>phon, &amp;c., in the English translations, than in the original,
<br/>for the reason that they can be comprehended with greater
<br/>ease and mastered in less time.</p>
            <p>“With a little reflection, all must allow, that when a critical know-
<br/>ledge of the text, and an accurate recollection of the matter of sixteen,
<br/>or more, Latin and Greek books are required, very little time can re-
<br/>main for reading the many works which are so desirable to illustrate
<br/>them.”</p>
            <p>“The first thing to consider is, for what purpose are you commenc-
<br/>ing a course of study. If to humor a literary ambition, to be thought
<br/>learned, and to excite the wonder of the ignorant, believe me, that till
<br/>you abandon this vile and degrading purpose, your vanity will increase
<br/>faster than your learning; what you gain in head you will lose in
<br/>heart; your mind will be tilled, but not refined; and you will excite
<br/>far more jealousy than admiration. Read, as Bacon said, for the
<br/>glory of your Creator, and for the relief of man’s estate, to improve
<br/>your talents for the race that is set before you, to prevent that periodi-
<br/>cal void within, which is doomed to fill, and that with gnawing cares,
<br/>and soul debasing thoughts. That is true of our faculties, which an
<br/>old officer told me of his men, that there was no such security for good
<br/>behaviour as active service.”* * * “Among the many who desire to be
<br/>thought literary characters, nothing is more common than an inclina-
<br/>tion to lock up the temple of knowledge, and throw away the key; or,
<br/>on attaining an eminence, to kick away the ladder, that none may fol-
<br/>low them. So beware of this class of literary impostors; their life is
<br/>one continued lie; a lie partly positive, because they pretend to know
<br/>far more than they do know; and partly a lie in direct, but far more
<br/>mischievous, because they seek to magnify difficulties, hint that things
<br/>are not so easy as they seem, and pretend that a peculiar talent is re-
<br/>quired for their favorite subjects. In every department of knowledge,
<br/>the man really proficient, is ever desirous to lead others on; and for-
<br/>getting all the difficulties to be encountered, firmly believes, and as
<br/>honestly confesses, he could teach his friends in half the time his
<br/>learning cost himself.”</p>
            <p>These extracts prove the author a sincere honest man, one
<br/>in whom you can trust as far as his own knowledge extends;
<br/>and if he had confined himself simply to the course of reading
<br/>which he had mastered himself, his book would have been
<br/>twice as valuable as it now is, when, according to his own
<br/>account, for much that he has recommended, he has depended
<br/>upon the advice of others.</p>
            <p>In the department of art, where every one thinks it neces-
<br/>sary to dabble, though he be profoundly and willingly igno-
<br/>rant of every thing else, he gropes his way like a blind man
<br/>on a strange road. He stands like Bartimeus in Raffaelle’s
<br/>Cartoon, feeling for something tangible, but missing it. The
<br/>famous writers in art are very few, and among these few,
<br/>those who can be read with profit, form but a very inconside-
<br/>rable part. Mr. Pycroft recommends the whole, which is
<br/>certainly safe, though it would have been safer to recommend
<br/>none.</p>
            <p>The Lectures of Sir Joshua Reynolds we may expect, as
<br/>a matter of course, to stand first on the list of an English-
<br/>man’s enumeration of readable works on Art. But the dis-
<br/>courses of Sir Joshua, though very agreeable reading, are
<br/>pervaded by errors in principle, which render them among
<br/>the most dangerous books that can be placed in the hands of
<br/>a neophyte. He is a popular author still, though his country-
<br/>men have begun to say that he was great in practice in spite
<br/>of his errors in theory. Hazlitt is recommended as well as
<br/>Sir Joshua, but his principles in criticism are the antipodes
<br/>of the theories of Sir Joshua. Unless the reader have suffi-
<br/>cient knowledge to perceive the truth himself, he would be
<br/>completely bewildered by such conflicting systems. Allan
<br/>Cunningham, who has contrived to imitate all that is bad in
<br/>both of these writers, without mingling in their faults any
<br/>good of his own, is also recommended by Mr. Pycroft. In
<br/>short, he includes in his catalogue everybody who has writ-
<br/>ten on Art excepting Leonardo and Lanzi. In his list of ar-
<br/>chitectural works he has omitted two of the best of modern
    
    <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>times—Hope’s Essay and Gwilt’s Cyclopoedia. But his re-
<br/>marks on this subject are exceedingly brief, and prove that
<br/>he felt but little interest in it. He would have acted more
<br/>judiciously in letting it alone altogether. The space devoted
<br/>to Biblical Literature is very ample, as might have been ex-
<br/>pected in a book of this kind from a clergyman.</p>
            <p>His directions on the study of poetry and works of taste,
<br/>are very curious. Johnson’s Lives is recommended as a hand-
<br/>book or guide to the poets.</p>
            <p>“Cowley, Waller, Philips, Parnell, Rowe, Prior, Gay, Green, Tick-
<br/>ell, Somerville, Swift, Collins, Dyer, Churchill, Akenside, Lyttleton,
<br/>Armstrong, J. Warton, T. Warton, Mason, Beatty, are authors of
<br/>whom those of limited opportunities may be contented to read such
<br/>parts only as Johnson, or other critics point out.”</p>
            <p>This is strange company to find Swift in; and the others,
<br/>excepting Prior and Gay, would probably be as much aston-
<br/>ished at being associated with him, as he with them. Mr.
<br/>Pycroft, of course, has never read a line of Swift, or he
<br/>would have shown better discrimination. If there is any
<br/>book in the English language sure of immortality, it is the
<br/>Tale of a Tub. But we should think it was too solid food for
<br/>the digestion of Mr. Pycroft, who seems to have a strange
<br/>craving for flummery.</p>
            <p>“Shakspeare no one should ever cease reading: begin with the tra-
    gedies.”</p>
            <p>We wish that Mr. PycToft had given some reason why
<br/>readers of Shakspeare should begin with the tragedies, or
<br/>what series of the tragedies, whether Titus Andronicus and
<br/>Pericles, or King John and Richard the Second; and it would
<br/>not have been amiss in giving so peremptory an order as to
<br/>never cease reading an author, to state why he should be read
<br/>at all. There is little need of directing any English reader to
<br/>Shakspeare, yet we have known men who confessed that
<br/>they read him, as a duty, but could not take any pleasure in
<br/>him. There can be no such thing as a universal directory in
<br/>study. Byron found Milton heavy, and Cobbett made Shak-
<br/>speare the butt of his irony. To name so humble an instance
<br/>as ourselves, after these illustrious names, may sound absurd-
<br/>ly, but no one is too humble to illustrate a principle; we never
<br/>could get through with a tithe of Robinson Crusoe, perhaps
<br/>the most universally read book in the language. Many an
<br/>idle hour have we loitered away in our summer days with
<br/>Dr. Doddridge or one of the dramatists of Charles the Second’s
<br/>time, but we never could get up an intimacy with Robinson
<br/>Crusoe.</p>
            <p>Among the works on America which Mr. Pycroft recom-
<br/>mends, are Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Trollope, Miss Martineau, Cap-
<br/>tain Hall, Dickens, and Sydney Smith. Why he should omit
<br/>Marryatt and Hamilton, is not easy to discern. The works
<br/>of American authors which he recommends, are very few.
<br/>Anthon’s Lempriere, Catlin’s Notes on the Indians, Two
<br/>Years Before the Mast, and Stuart’s Letters to Dr. Channing,
<br/>are all.</p>
            <p>Mr. Coggswell, in his Appendix, fills up the deficiencies
<br/>of the author with a liberal hand. He adds every work that
<br/>has ever been heard of on the subject of America, excepting
<br/>one, which he had not, probably, heard of himself. This is
<br/>an account in La Mosaique de L'Ouest, of the discovery of this
<br/>continent by a Norman navigator, who landed at the mouth
<br/>of the Amazon, in 1488, four years prior to the discovery by
<br/>Columbus. This navigator was a native of Dieppe, named
<br/>Cousin, from which port he sailed on a voyage of discovery,
<br/>fitted out by the merchants of his nation, whom he had
<br/>persuaded to engage in the undertaking, upon representations
<br/> similar to those which Columbus had made to his patrons.
<br/> Among the adventurers who accompanied Cousin was a boat-
<br/> swain, or mate, contra-maitre, named Vincent Pinzan, who<div class="pagebreak" id="#page67"/>
    
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>quarrelled with his commander, and afterwards was one of
<br/>the most sanguine of those who seconded the endeavors of
<br/>Columbus, as is well known. A very satisfactory library
<br/>might be formed out of the works which neither Mr. Pycroft
<br/>nor Mr. Coggswell have alluded to.</p>
            <p>His notes on the poets are highly amusing.</p>
            <p>“Of Addison—read Cato, and Psalm 23.” This differs
<br/>Widely from Dr. Blair’s advice, “Give your days and nights
<br/>to Addison.”</p>
            <p>“Of Pope—the Essay on Criticism, and the Dunciad, show
<br/>that Pope could write as strong lines as any writer.” Pope
<br/>was strong in the Dunciad, among poets, in the same sense
<br/>that the skunk is strong among animals.</p>
            <p>“Of Coleridge—like Shelley and others of the same school,
<br/>he often failed in the single step which would have attained to
<br/>the sublime, and therefore their writings seem to remain in the
<br/>regions of the ridiculous.” Here is a very common error
<br/>among thoughtless writers. The step from the sublime to
<br/>the ridiculous, is the step downwards—not from the ridicu-
<br/>lous to the sublime. One may fall in a moment from a height
<br/>which he has been all day in reaching, but no one ever fell
<br/>upward by a false step.</p>
            <p>The book is published in a very handsome manner, and
<br/>but for the leaden tint of the ink, would look like an English
<br/>edition.</p>

            <div class="piece" id="#p2"> 
            <p>The Chimes, A Goblin Story. By Charles Dickens, Esq. New York, 
E. Winchester. Republished.</p>
            <p>The Chimes are in the Dickens vein, but not the true vein
<br/>—there’s neither a laugh nor a tear among them all. If the
<br/>Christmas Carol had not come first, the Chimes would never
<br/>have come at all. It is the first time that Boz has at-
<br/>tempted to repeat himself; and he has failed as signally as
<br/>though he had attempted to imitate somebody else. The
<br/>Carol was a bright bubble, a perfect sphere with all the pri-
<br/>mitive colors playing upon its surface; the Chimes is no-
<br/>thing more than a painted shell. Scrooge and Tiny Tim
<br/>will live for ever, but there is nobody in the Chimes whose
<br/>life will last a twelvemonth. Toby Veck has no individua-
<br/>lity, but such as his clothes give him—which is nothing.
<br/>Richard and Meg, and Alderman Cute, the Member of Par-
<br/>liament, the Goblins of the Bells, and all, are misty, unsub-
<br/>stantial personages. It is Boz, but living Boz no more. The
<br/>Chimes, too, give out a tone that is becoming wearisome:
<br/>we do not like the key note—it has that dismal wail which
<br/>is becoming fashionable among dandies and misers, the cant
<br/>of philanthropy. Mr. Dickens has almost caricatured the
<br/>tribe in the exaggerated portrait of Sir Joseph Bowerley, in-
<br/>tended probably to personify the “new generation.” He
<br/>gives Young England some terrible thwacks—hard enough,
<br/>we should think, to demolish so young a gentleman.</p>
            <p>In calling the Chimes a failure, we only compare it with
<br/>the other productions of the same author; compared with
<br/>the successful works of many others, it is prodigious. No
<br/>one can read it without feeling that Dickens is a thorough
<br/>good fellow: one who sympathises keenly with the lower
<br/>orders of society, and who sees through the flimsy veil which
<br/>respectable rogues throw over their own actions. Like all
<br/>of his productions, it is bold, rapid, and sincere. You cannot
<br/>perceive any marks of doubt or hesitancy: no erasures, no
<br/>after-thoughts, no mending of passages; but you are con-
<br/>scious of having before you the first conception of the author,
<br/>in its original integrity, without having been submitted to
<br/>the emasculating corrections of a calculating prudence, or
<br/>the refinements of a fastidious taste. It is this freshness
<br/>which distinguishes all his writings, that gives them one of
      
      <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>their chief attractions. His copy goes from his hand to the
<br/>printer before the ink is dry. There are many slovenly pas-
<br/>sages in his writings in consequence, but no stiff ones. The
<br/>Chimes contains many passages of unapproachable beauty,
<br/>and some impersonations which are equal to any thing that
<br/>he has done before in the same way. The wind is his favor-
<br/>ite element: he writes of its pranks in a spirit of love. In
<br/>Martin Chuzzlewit, and in the Christmas Carol, it seemed
<br/>like a witch element to him. Of the same nature it appears
<br/>in the Chimes:</p>
            <p>“For the night wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and
<br/>round a building of that sort, and moaning as it goes; and of trying
<br/>with its unseen hand, the windows and the doors: and seeking out
<br/>some crevices by which to enter. And when it has got in: as one
<br/>not finding what it seeks, whatever that may be; it wails and howls
<br/>to issue forth again: and not content with stalking through the aisles
<br/>and gliding round and round the pillars, and tempting the deep organ,
<br/>soars up to the roof, and strives to rend the rafters; then flings itself
<br/>despairingly upon the stones below, and passes, muttering, into the
<br/>vaults. Anon, it comes up stealthily, and creeps along the walls;
<br/>seeming to read, in whispers, the Inscriptions sacred to the Dead.
<br/>At some of these it breaks out shrilly , as with laughter; and at oth-
<br/>ers, moans and cries as if it were lamenting. It has a ghostly sound
<br/>too, lingering within the altar; where it seems to chaunt, in its wild
<br/>way, of Wrong and Murder alone, and false Gods worshipped; in de-
<br/>fiance of the Tables of the Law, which look so fair and smooth, but
<br/>are so flawed and broken. Ugh! Heaven preserve us, sitting snugly
<br/>round the fire! It has an awful voice, that wind at Midnight, singing
<br/>in a church!</p>
            <p>“But high up in the steeple! There the foul blast roars and whis-
<br/>tles! High up in the steeple, where it is free to come and go through
<br/>many an airy arch and loop-hole, and to twist and twine itself about
<br/>the giddy stair, and twirl the groaning weathercock, and make the
<br/>very tower shake and shiver! High up in the steeple, where the
<br/>belfry is; and iron rails are ragged with rust; and sheets of lead and
<br/>copper shrivelled by the changing weather, crackle and heave beneath
<br/>the unaccustomed tread: the birds stuff shabby nests into corners of
<br/>old oaken joists and beams; and dust grows old and grey; and spec-
<br/>kled spiders, indolent and fat with long security, swing idly to and fro,
<br/>in the vibration of the bells, and never loose their hold upon their
<br/>thread spun castles in the air, or climb up sailor-like in quick alarm,
<br/>or drop upon the ground and ply a score o; nimble legs to save a lie!
<br/>High up in the steeple of an old church, far above the light and mur-
<br/>mur of the town, and far below the flying clouds that shadow it, is the
<br/>wild and dreary place at night; and high up in the steeple of an old
<br/>church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.”</p>
            <p>We have heard a good many wonderful stories of miserly
<br/>hearts being melted, and churls made amiable, by the mere
<br/>reading of the Christmas Carol, but we fear that the good
<br/>done by the Chimes will not be as great. There are parts
<br/>of it that make riches appear hateful, but none that render
<br/>poverty pleasant. Mr. Filer and Alderman Cute are very-
<br/>gross caricatures, so is Lady Bowerley; but there is something
<br/>inexpressibly fine, a satire terribly scorching on the benevo-
<br/>lence of the upper classes, in her ladyship’s charitable de-
<br/>signs.</p>
            <p>“Let him be made an example of, by all means,” returned the la-
<br/>dy. “Last winter, when I introduced pinking and eyelet-holeing
<br/>among the men and boys in the village, as a nice evening employ-
<br/>ment, and had the lines,
<div class="lg">
                  <br/>Oh let us love our occupations,
  <br/>Bless the squire and his relations,
  <br/>Live upon our daily rations,
  <br/>And always know our proper stations,</div>
               <br/>set to music on the new system, for them to sing the while: this very
<br/>Fern—I see him now—touched that hat of his, and said,  'I humbly
<br/>ask your pardon my lady, but an’t I something different from a great
<br/>girl?’ I expected it, of course; who can expect anything but insolence
<br/>and ingratitude from that class of people? That is not to the purpose,
<br/>however. Sir Joseph! Make an example of him!’ ”</p>
            <p>In that kind of writing called grotesque, Dickens stands at
<br/>an unapproachable height; his page teems with phantoms;
<br/>the commonest objects assume a fantastic shape the moment
<br/>he touches them; rusty hinges, battered doors, toppling chim-
<br/>neys, bits of lead, scraps of tin and old nails become instinct
<br/>with life, and suddenly assume a new character as though
<br/>the wand of an enchanter had touched them. But his gro-
<br/>tesques have not that aimless merely grotesque existence
<br/>which the wizard shapes of other authors have; they speak
<br/>to us smoothly, and their words are imbued with a wisdom
<br/>above that of ordinary men.</p>

            <p>" 'The voice of Time,’ said a phantom, 'cries to man, Advance!
<br/>Time is for his advancement and improvement; for his greater worth,
<br/>his greater happiness, his better lite; his progress onward to that
<br/>goal within its knowledge and its view, and set there, in the period
<br/>when Time and he began. Ages of darkness, wickedness, and vio-
<br/>lence, have come and gone; millions unaccountable, have suffered,
<br/>lived, and died; to point the way before him. Who seeks to turn
<br/>him back, or stay him on his course, arrests a mighty engine which
<br/>will strike the meddler dead; and he the fiercer and the wilder, for
<br/>its momentary check!'</p>
            <p>" 'I never did so, to my knowledge, Sir,' said Trotty. 'It was
<br/>quite by accident if I did. I wouldn’t go to do it, I’m sure.’
<br/>" 'Who puts into the mouth of Time, or of its servants,’ said the
<br/>Goblin of the Bell,  'a cry of lamentation for days which have had
<br/>their trial and their failure, and have left deep traces of it which the
<br/>blind may sec—a cry that only serves the Present Time, by showing
<br/>men how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets
<br/>for such a past—who does this, does a wrong. And you have done
<br/>that wrong to us, the Chimes.’ ”</p>
            <p>The English Reviewers have all spoken highly of the
<br/>Chimes, and the Edinburgh gives it a notice longer than the
<br/>book itself; but the same causes which help to render it po-
<br/>pular there, have hardly an existence here. Our rich and
<br/>poor occupy different positions. The poor here is the privi-
<br/>leged class. We have no Aldermen Cutes, do Toby Vecks,
<br/>God be praised for it. The Chimes is a politico-comic pro-
<br/>duction, and will be more popular with politicians than idle
<br/>readers. The illustrations which ornament the London edi-
<br/>tion are by famous artists, but have nothing but the names
<br/>of the artists to recommend them.</p>

            <p>The Natural Boundaries of Empires, and a New View of Colo-
<br/>nization. By John Finch, Esq., Corresponding Member of the
<br/>Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, and of the Natural His-
<br/>tory Societies of Montreal, New York, New Brunswick, Delaware,
<br/>etc. London: Longmans, 1844. Imported by Wiley &amp; Putnam.</p>
            <div class="ab">(Second Notice.)</div>
            <p>As this book is not likely to be placed in the hands of our
<br/>reading public, we give a few more extracts from it, to show
<br/>more fully than our notice of last week could do, the general
<br/>spirit which pervades it.</p>
            <p>“  'War,’ said the great captain of his age,  war is the trade of bar-
<br/>barians. The whole art consists in assembling a force superior to
<br/>your adversary.’ This can be accomplished by a great naval power,
<br/>which is thus enabled to seize, much to her own detriment, on various
<br/>small isolated portions of the world, and on extensive kingdoms which
<br/>have not yet arrived at their full power, or which have become imbe-
<br/>cile and weak from age.</p>
            <p>"Happy therefore would it be for every nation, if the ocean would
<br/>rise with storm and with tempest against ships of war, and tranquil
<br/>seas and favouring gales were reserved for honest merchant ships and
<br/>gaily painted yachts. Then when the land was infested by war, each
<br/>one who was peaceably inclined might advance to the shore and em-
<br/>bark in his yacht, with a plentiful store of provisions and wine, sail
<br/>about on the tranquil surface of the ocean, and return to the land when
<br/>the war was over. Less tyranny would be practised, and the indepen-
<br/>dence of nations would be much promoted.’’</p>
            <p>It is hardly possible that a work like this, which makes
<br/>war upon the deepest rooted prejudices of the world, can ex-
<br/>ert any influence in removing the errors which grow out of
<br/>them. Reformers must not be too radical, if they would do
<br/>good. The world has but little sympathy with those who
<br/>have keener sight than itself. It was a difficult thing for
<br/>Columbus to persuade the monarchs of his time to aid him
<br/>in his attempt to discover a new Continent; but now that
<br/>everything is discovered, every nation sends out ships on voy-
<br/>ages of discovery. If the Genoese had aimed at nothing
<br/>more than an island, it is probable that any of the Christian
<br/>monarchs would have seconded his designs. But a new Con-
<br/>tinent was too much for their understanding. So, an amend-
<br/>ment of an odious law, or the curtailment of what are called
<br/>the national defences, may sometimes be accomplished, but an
<br/>attempt to abolish altogether, would be resisted by the con-
<br/>servative instincts of society.</p>
            <p>There is food for deep thought, for missionaries of all kinds,
        in the follow ng extract.</p>
            <p>"In Upper Lusatia, in Germany, is a tribe of people called Wends,
<br/>descended from the good Saxons who resisted with such true valour
<br/>the armies of Charlemagne. They dress in the skins of sheep, and
  
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>dwell in tents. They are perfectly happy, lor they lead a pastoral
<br/>life, and cordially pity those unfortunate people who are compelled to
<br/>reside in towns. Towns! where Mother Earth is carefully hidden from
<br/>view by a heavy pavement of brick or of stone; where the air is pol-
<br/>luted by a thousand vitious exhalations, and where sleep, silence and
<br/>solitude are unknown.</p>
            <p>“In the midst of Christian Europe they retain a solemn Pagan rite,
<br/>and a grove of majestic oak trees, near the centre of their territory, is
<br/>their object of religious adoration. They were formerly under the go-
<br/>vernment of the Elector of Saxony, who allowed them to pursue their
<br/>own course without interference, having perceived the folly of any at-
<br/>tempt to control them. In the exchange of territory which took place in
<br/>Europe during the year 1815, they were transferred, along with some
<br/>other Saxon subjects, to the jurisdiction of Prussia. The monarch of
<br/>that country, when informed of the circumstance, issued an immediate
<br/>order that they should pay a tax and contribution, and attend Chris-
<br/>tian worship. An officer was appointed to execute the decree.</p>
            <p>“It was soon discovered that, unless they were caught and chained
<br/>to the benches, it was impossible to procure their attendance in the
<br/>cathedral of Luchaw. Two companies of infantry were then detached
<br/>to cut down the sacred grove; but the tribe threatened destruction to
<br/>all who engaged in the attempt. The commissioner of Prussia, wish-
<br/>ing to avoid bloodshed in a newly acquired territory, desisted from
<br/>this part of the enterprise.</p>
            <p>“The project of converting them forcibly to Christianity having
<br/>failed, it was thought highly desirable that they should pay tribute,
<br/>and a large sum was demanded. The chiefs of the tribe replied, that
<br/>money was totally unknown among them; that flocks of sheep and
<br/>herds of cattle were the only things they possessed, and they could
<br/>not, with any convenience to themselves, part with and of them.
<br/>They said that if the King was hungry, and came that way, they
<br/>would kill a lamb and roast it for his dinner; but they resolutely re-
<br/>fused to pay any tax, and immediately assembled in arms to defend
<br/>their property. The Prussian officer finding he could do nothing with
<br/>this inexorable race, was obliged to leave them in possession of their
<br/>ancient freedom.</p>
            <p>"Like this tribe, the people of every country have certain habits,
<br/>customs, feelings, opinions, and prejudices, by which they are distin-
<br/>guished from other nations. These customs are so powerful, that it is
<br/>impossible to eradicate them; nor would it be desirable.</p>
            <p>“As medals are more valued for the variety of their impressions, so
<br/>nations present a more pleasing aspect from the variety of their cus-
<br/>toms, the difference of their opinions, and the distinct character of
<br/>their political institutions.</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>" 'The shuddering tenant of the Frigid Zone
  <br/>Boldly proclaims the happiest spot his own;
<br/>Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,
<br/>And his long nights of revelry and ease.
<br/>The naked Negro, panting at the Line,
<br/>Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine;
<br/>Banks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,
<br/>And thanks his gods for all the wealth they gave.
<br/>Such is the patriot’s boast, where’er he roam,
  <br/>His first, best country', ever is, at home.’</div>
            <p>“This circumstance contributes much to the comfort and happiness
<br/>of the human race; each nation considers its own law, custom, and
<br/>institution—soil, climate, and provision—habit, manner, and govern-
<br/>ment, as far superior to all others. There is one thing which every
<br/>nation adores, and that is itself; each nation believes itself the most
<br/>free, the most wise, the most brave, the most every thing.</p>
            <p>"The praise and the superiority of his native land is the pleasing
<br/>theme of every orator in every country. lie who assures his audience
<br/>they are the best and most enlightened people on the face of the earth,
<br/>will always receive abundant applause. Were it otherwise, it would
<br/>show a great want of proper feeling; for ingratitude is one of the
<br/>worst vices that can be charged against individuals; but the man who
<br/>is grateful for kindness conferred on him, possesses many other good
<br/>qualities. An orator and his audience thus mutually delighted with
<br/>each other, present a very pleasing spectacle.</p>
            <p>"Frequently a community considers its own law, government and re-
<br/>ligion, so excellent, it desires to enforce them on other nations. Hence
<br/>arises one cause of war.”</p>
            <p>Our next extract is of a similar character; but we are not
<br/>sure that the reasoning is correct. The government of a
<br/>country cannot be said to form the people, but the people
<br/>must create the government, let its character be what it may.
<br/>Every nation makes its own rulers; it matters not what
<br/>names they may bear, whether kings or senators.</p>
            <p>“The most important circumstance connected with the welfare of
<br/>man, is the government which exercises a control over his actions and
<br/>his thoughts; for, in every country where the human race have exis-
<br/>ted for some time under one species of power, his sentiments and his
<br/>ideas become gradually assimilated to the government under which
<br/>he is placed. A single glance at the countries that were formerly pros-
<br/>perous and flourishing under free institutions, and which are now ren-
<br/>dered desolate and oppressed by despotic power, would confirm so ir-
<br/>resistibly this view of the subject, and has been so often illustrated
<br/>by various writers, that it is not worth while to cite any examples.
<br/>They will readily occur to any one who is conversant with history.</p>
            <p>“There is not any nation which desires to have a good government;
<br/>that is, it is not the first and principal object which they desire. The
<br/>first wish of all nations, and which they are unhappy if they do not
<br/>attain, is to be governed according to their peculiar ideas and prejudices. There is no doubt they believe these to be founded in truth
<br/>and justice; but how fur this is from being actually the case, the his-
<br/>tory of every country will elucidate. Even if a nation should desire it,<div class="pagebreak" id="#page69"/>

               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>—as governments are carried on by human agents, and their power is
<br/>exercised over human subjects,—how is it possible it should be per-fect? they of necessity partake of the general imperfection of all hu-
<br/>man things. Can we construct a temple which shall continue to at-
<br/>tract for ages the admiration of mankind with diminutive bricks, or
<br/>will you raise a pile of timber to last for centuries?</p>
            <p>“Let us therefore make a few enquiries what the human race are.
<br/>In the first place, in respect to their form, which has some relation to
<br/>the subject, although it may appear a distant one; and in the next,
<br/>with respect to their disposition or character, on which, in point of
<br/>fact, governments depend for their development. Do we find perfec-
<br/>tion of form or character in any member of the human race with
<br/>whom we have ever been acquainted? A French author has very
<br/>truly observed, that we are surrounded by merely halves and quarters
<br/>of men.</p>
            <p>With reverence be it spoken, the reason why angels are not permit-
<br/>ted to visit the earth, except at very distant intervals, is because they
<br/>would be stared at as curiosities; and yet the accounts which are giv-
<br/>en to us of angelic natures is, that they merely exhibit all the good
<br/>qualities of which man is capable, wrought to the highest degree of
<br/>intensity. Who ever saw perfection in the human figure? and what
<br/>lumps of men we see around us, and what a variety! Why is it that
<br/>the statues of the Apollo di Belvidere and the Venus de Medici al-
<br/>ways excite in us such emotions of pleasure and delight ? If we met
<br/>Apollos walking in the street, and Venuses were our companions eve-
<br/>ry moment of our leisure hours, we should pass by the statues with-
<br/>out observation. It is because they are very beautiful and differ from
<br/>anything we see in common life, that they attract our notice.</p>
            <p>“Monarchy, especially hereditary monarchy, is expensive; it is so
<br/>of necessity. All people, all nations, connect ideas of dignity with
<br/>expense and luxury. It is a false association of ideas, but so general,
<br/>that it is adopted by every nation. It is therefore necessary that the
<br/>monarch presiding over the destinies of a nation should excel all his
<br/>subjects in luxury and expense, as much as he exceeds them in power.
<br/>There have been but two monarchs since the commencement of time
<br/>who were maintained at a very trifling cost to their subjects; and the
<br/>nations over whom they ruled were so exasperated against them on
<br/>that account, that they put one to death and were constantly conspiring
<br/>against the other. The first was the beautiful white ox that reigned
<br/>in Egypt, and of whom an account is given in the pages of Herodotus.
<br/>He was one of the best monarchs the world ever saw ; he never en-
<br/>gaged in bloody wars to gratify an unreasonable ambition, or to ex-
<br/>tend his dominion; and while he chewed the cud, his subjects were
<br/>peaceful and happy. It was under his reign that some of those beau-
<br/>tiful temples were built, which have attested to a later age the pow-
<br/>er and magnificence of ancient Egypt, and which the modem degen-
<br/>erate nations of Europe make not even an attempt to imitate. A
<br/>plentiful supply of grass, with a little corn and pure water, were all
<br/>that he required; but at length his subjects were so indignant against
<br/>him, because he would not spend more money, that they rose in rebel-
<br/>lion, effected a revolution, and cruelly put him to death.”</p>

         <div class="head">AMERICAN PROSE WRITERS.
            <br/>NO. 3.
            <br/>R. H. Dana.</div>
         <p>If fancy (as we justly conceive the case to be) represent
<br/>the leading traits in the intellectual constitution of Mr.
<br/>Willis: sentiment, we apprehend, with no less characteris-
<br/>tic force, forms the most prominent features in the genius
<br/>and writings of Mr. Dana. No mere sentimentalist, our au-
<br/>thor is emphatically a man of sentiment: no hypocritical Jo-
<br/>seph Surface, full of cant and moral pretensions, but a genu-
<br/>ine man of feeling, unlike, or rather superior to, Mackenzie’s
<br/>hero, in being, in addition, a true philosophic observer of
<br/>life and character, a stem self-student, and, a powerful
<br/>painter, according to the stereotyped phrase, of men and
<br/>manners.</p>
            <p>This attribute of sentiment, in the instance of our author,
<br/>is at one and the same time, a moral and an intellectual
<br/>quality, religious, high-toned, upright, masculine, partaking
<br/>of the softness of Mackenzie and the stern dignity of Words-
<br/>worth. Apart from this faculty, Mr. Dana is a writer of
<br/>great purity and power, of much acuteness and elegance in
<br/>other walks than in those of philosophic sentiment or of
<br/>sentimental description; but in those he is a master, and
<br/>ranks first among his contemporaries and countrymen. He
<br/>has vast powers in depicting the struggles of the darker pas-
<br/>sions, jealousy, hatred, suspicion and remorse. Paul Felton
<br/>has touches of Byronnic force, and discloses a similar vein to
<br/>that so fully opened and with such popular effect in the
<br/>works of Godwin and Chas. Brockden Brown.</p>
            <p>This, however, is what one would call, perhaps, with a
<br/>certain degree of innocence, the uncomfortable portion of
<br/>Mr. Dana’s genius, and of which the tendency is doubtful.
<br/>It is an open literary question, as to the extent that such
<br/>characters as that of Paul Felton should be taken, for the de-
<br/>lineation of real characters. An idiot, a madman, a mono-
<br/>maniac, may be made very effective in vigorous description,
<br/>but is not the simple-hearted Jonathan Fords, for example,
              
<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>a better character both for study and imitation? Doubtless
<br/>more than one Paul Felton has birds, but we do not go to
<br/>nature, in bad extravagances or capricious words, for instruc-
<br/>tion or delight—else the records of a Prison or a Lunatic
<br/>Asylum would form the truest volumes of history, instead of
<br/>merely furnishing a few supplementary chapters of strange
<br/>idiosyncrasies, or morbid developments. But, we have no
<br/>idea of going into a deep question of psychological criticism
<br/>at present; merely remarking that we have not the remotest
<br/>idea of any, but the purest intention, in the mind of the crea-
<br/>tor of that wretched man, as he has himself called him, and
<br/>yet from false sympathy or an unhappy bias, that way, the
<br/>readers of that most terrible history may become unaware so
<br/>strangely interested in the character and fate of the hero, as
<br/>to feel the ill effects of such an unmanly weakness long after
<br/>he had hurriedly perused the story—the wonderful truth and
<br/>fidelity of the analysis of the heart, and the vivid description
<br/>of the darkest passions, set off and release the hateful moral
<br/>deformity of the diabolical passions, that festers and finally ut-
<br/>terly corrupts the heart of their victim. Otherwise, as a
<br/>picture of naked hideousness, the tale could be read only by
<br/>the wisest and the weakest.</p>
         <p>The sentiments of the writer even in the midst of these
<br/>harrowing scenes, comes in as an angel during a whirlwind
<br/>excited by the most malicious fiends in hell, spreading a hea-
<br/>venly calm, and casting a pure bright effulgence over an at-
<br/>mosphere of gloom and despair.</p>
         <p>In Paul Felton, Mr. Dana has exhibited power in depicting
<br/>passion, as well as sentiment: and the same criticism ap-
<br/>plies to his Thornton, though in a much inferior degree.
<br/>Yet he is most at home in pictures of domestic life; in de-
<br/>scribing the charm of home scenes, in realizing the ideal of
<br/>conjugal felicity. Strange, that the author, who as a man is
<br/>so enthusiastic on such a theme, should, as a poet, (for he is
<br/>one as much in Tom Thornton and Paul Felton, as in the
<br/>Buccaneers,) delight in pictures, also, of gloom, of crime, of
<br/>remorse.</p>
         <p>Sentiment furnishes the key, also, to the criticisms of
<br/>Dana. We noticed this in his lectures a few winters since
<br/>on the poets and dramatists. He finds this, his favorite facul-
<br/>ty, beautifully expressed by the ballad writers and the Shaks-
<br/>perian dramatists among the old writers; and by Words-
<br/>worth and Coleridge, among the new; and to them he has
<br/>given his heart. The single critical paper in the volume of
<br/>Dana’s selected works, on the acting of Kean, is full of it, no less
<br/>than of acuteness and deep insight into the mysteries of art,
<br/>both of which indeed are colored and refined by it, to a point
<br/>and degree that may be honestly declared as not being very
<br/>far distant from perfection. The paper is almost equal in its
<br/>way, to Elia’s admirable miniature sketches: differing, as
<br/>widely in spirit, as they resemble each other in execution.</p>
         <p>As a writer of sentiment, love, in its forms both of senti-
<br/>ment and passion, (for it varies in different natures, and is the
<br/>offspring of the temperaments of the affections and of the
<br/>fancy, according to the individual constitution, mental or mor-
<br/>al, or sensitive of the recipient and cherisher of it,) constitutes
<br/>the staple of Dana’s inventions and speculations—of love in
<br/>all of its degrees, he is a delicate limner or a vigorous pain-
<br/>ter, according as the subject is a delicate woman or a manly
<br/>man: a quiet, retired, meditative nature, or a stirring, active,
<br/>ambitious character. The female character has full justice
<br/>done it, by the writer of Edward and Mary. Judging from
<br/>his writings on this subject, Mr. Dana has been a happy man.
<br/>Yet he can paint a weak credulous mother, or a dashing,
<br/>heartless woman of fashion (see Tom Thornton) with as
<br/>subtle skill as he can delineate the fond, confiding heart, the
<br/>clear and wise judgment, the gentle and amiable tastes, of
<br/>a true woman and a good wife.</p>
         <p>We have other points to speak of, than that only of our au-
<br/>thor’s sentiments, however, and must not dwell too long on
<br/>that.</p>
         <p>Mr. Dana has been connected in ties of literature and fami-
<br/>ly connection, with the first artist and finest poet of our
<br/>country. Allston and Dana married sisters, and remained to
<br/>the last intimate associates. We have heard Mr. D. speak of
<br/>his works out at Cambridgeport (we think where Allston re-
<br/>sided) and his conversations there with the Poet Painter, as
<br/>among his richest pleasures, nor should we forget that Bry-
<br/>ant was the early associate, as he remains the "oldest friend
<br/>of our author. Some of Dana’s finest portrait contributions,
<br/>were included in Bryant’s New York Review. The father,
<br/>too, is happy in a son who has written one of the best books<div class="pagebreak" id="#page70"/>

            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>of its class since the world renowned fiction of De Foe. With
<br/>these connections to boast of, the nobility of genius has had
<br/>to contend with comparative neglect and poverty: sure ever
<br/>of a high place in the esteem and admiration of good critics,
<br/>honest readers and worthy men, whose applause constitutes
<br/>his fame, but who have little else to give beyond sympathy
<br/>and respect.</p>
         <p>The late reviews of American novelists, in the Quarterly,
<br/>just and fair in the main, was yet guilty of omissions that
<br/>should have been noticed at the time, and filled up by a
<br/>competent critic. It is not our purpose, at present, to occupy
<br/>the whole ground, nor fill the entire vacancy—that is to be
<br/>left to the writer, who can honestly appraise the merits of
<br/>the authors less unnoticed, in a sort of article supplementa-
<br/>ry. Three comic writers, at least as worthy of notice as Miss
<br/>Leslie,—Neale, Matthews, and the author of Harry Fran-
<br/>co, our best comic satirists since Paulding’s Salmagundi,
<br/>have escaped notice entirely; while two serious writers, of
<br/>unquestionable excellence, Allston in his Monaldi, and Dana,
<br/>in certain prose dramas, among prose fictions, what the
<br/>masterpieces of Heywood or Middleton would prove by the
<br/>side of the Shaksperian drama, have been passed by without
<br/>ever attracting a casual remark.</p>
         <p>This neglect may furnish some excuse for the foregoing
<br/>remarks and the critical observations that may follow, al-
<br/>beit, we had hoped the task might have been committed to
<br/>other hands. Nor shall we attempt to disentangle the mesh-
<br/>es of the tales themselves; skilful unwinding of the thread
<br/>of a narrative, or the decomposition of a plot, or an analysis
<br/>of the conduct of the incidents, ranking in our opinion, when
<br/>well done, almost with the original poem that gave birth to
<br/>the fiction. And as we do not write tales, but merely criti-
<br/>cisms upon them, we shall speak of the qualities displayed
<br/>in the construction of these narratives, rather than the inci-
<br/>dents or the characters they contain. Another and an equal-
<br/>ly good reason, as it appears to us, for the present sketch,
<br/>may be found in the fact, that our authors had been gradu-
<br/>ally lost sight of by the generation of readers that have risen
<br/>since he wrote. To a large number, we fear, nothing of
<br/>Dana is known beyond his name; with whom, too, his name
<br/>is getting to be matter of tradition. It is now nearly a quar-
<br/>ter of a century, since we have seen anything in print by the
<br/>author of the Idle Man. During which period so many can-
<br/>didates for public honor and claimants for a niche in the
<br/>temple of fame have been pouring in, that the public eye is
<br/>well nigh clouded by the sparkling ephemerida, and the
<br/>public ear confounded by loud clamors and noisy appeals.
<br/>In the midst of this hubbub, the silent speculative genius
<br/>of Dana, and the power, the purity, and the classic genius
<br/>of Dana’s writings, have passed almost unregarded.—
<br/>Among the thousands who devour James, the tens who
<br/>study Dana may be easily enumerated; the lovers of his-
<br/>torical melo-drama, see nothing in simple, undisguised,
<br/>unaffected, yet most real and vigorous, true dramatic paint-
<br/>ing. Perhaps the American is too much of a philosopher for
<br/>those readers, who are captivated by detailed narrative and
<br/>circumstantial description; though, as a mere writer of tales
<br/>full of striking characters, closely crowded with stirring in-
<br/>cidents, set in a frame of poetic description, and enshrined
<br/>within a halo of imagination, Dana is in the first rank of no-
<br/>velists. It is wrong to speak of him as a mere tale writer:
<br/>for his tales are not only as long as certain short novels (as
<br/>long and longer than Rasselas, Zadig, Candide, the Man of
<br/>Feeling, or the admirable fictions of Richter, Zschokke,
<br/>and other German novelists) but they are as closely woven,
<br/>that they read sometimes like abstracts of longer works.
<br/>There is nothing to be spared; the utmost economy is ob-
<br/>served, consistent with real richness and vigor. Yet, as we
<br/>said, the evident philosophic character of the author, the
<br/>basis, indeed, of his portrait character, as well; the love of
<br/>speculating upon character, the motives to action, the prin-
<br/>ciples of conduct, may deter the mere readers for amuse-
<br/>ment, since Dana is manifestly a teacher of men, and is to
<br/>be estimated rightly only in that character. He had selected
<br/>prose fiction, we imagine, only as a vehicle for conveying
<br/>certain pictures of life, portraits of individuals, certain whole-
<br/>some moral satire, an ideal of contented private enjoyments,
<br/>and of a life of action, enlightened duty. His invention
<br/>is probably, therefore, voluntary, and the offspring of ready
<br/>impulse. Hence a want of the popular manner and of the
<br/>“taking” style. He is not a popular writer, and has,
<br/>rightly, not aimed at popularity. This he confesses, and

<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>justifies with sense and honesty. His real mind—the cast of
<br/>a writer’s mind must be popular, to render his writings
<br/>such, yet there is no element of that kind in our author’s
<br/>intellectual constitution. He is too honest to disguise his
<br/>defects to individuals; too sincere to please the literary mob.
<br/>He is sure of the aristocracy of genius and scholarship and
<br/>true worth; the class composed of the wisest and best—the
<br/>true aristocracy. To take an elevated example, he, like Mil-
<br/>ton, will always be read by the choice few, while, like him,
<br/>he must remain caviere to the mass of readers.</p>
         <p>We insinuate nothing, byway of comparison between the
<br/>two; for Milton is first among the greatest, while Dana
<br/>would be too wise to accept of a place among the greatest at
<br/>all. He is first among the lesser lights, the Dii Minores of
<br/>our literary firmament.</p>
         <p>The facts of Mr. Dana’s literary career are known to few.
<br/>Beside the history of his literary connexions, mentioned be-
<br/>fore, we have heard of little else. We once heard Mr, D.
<br/>speak of his life as passed in his room. He has been much of
<br/>an invalid, and has led, we understand, a retired life. The
<br/>only account the public at large, even here, at home, have
<br/>of one of the first men we can point to, is to be found in
<br/>Blackwood’s Magazine for 1824 or 5. It occurs in a para-
<br/>graph, in a series of papers on American writers, ascribed to
<br/>John Neal, and evidently from his pen. It is instinct with
<br/>the shrewdness and sense of that very clever man, and dash-
<br/>ed off in his slashing off-hand style. Without a number of
<br/>the Magazine by us, we must quote from memory. Neal
<br/>complains of Dana’s indolence and careful polish; though he
<br/>gives high and just praise for soundness, purity, and true
<br/>genius, he adds certain censure on his excessive care, some-
<br/>what after this manner. Dance (a misprint) is pure, sound,
<br/>full of genius, but timid, where he has a fair chance, shuts
<br/>the wrong eye and is apt to miss. Fond of carving heads,
<br/>or cherry stones with his friend Bryant; but the public care
<br/>nothing for the otto of prose. Neal says, that he almost
<br/>ruined himself and damned the North American Review,
<br/>by an article on Hazlitt’s Poets—an exaggerated sentence in
<br/>the true John Neal style. When or how long Dana edited
<br/>the North American Review, we cannot exactly discern.
<br/>Two only of his reviews have attracted much attention—on
<br/>Moore and on Hazlitt’s lectures—the latter harsh, and we
<br/>think, unjust. Mr. Dana thinks (or did think) Hazlitt very
<br/>much inferior to the notion his admirers entertain of him.
<br/>The paper on Moore is just, manly, and creditable to the
<br/>critic’s heart, as well as his taste. Much excellent matter is
<br/>doubtless buried under a heap of quarterly rubbish. Neal,
<br/>in a concluding sentence, reproves our author for his silence
<br/>and indolence, stating that Dana had done in several years
<br/>as much as he (Neal) could have done in as many weeks or
<br/>months. Very likely, but with a difference; with a different
<br/>quality, we make bold to think, however, and hardly destined
<br/>to survive its year or deeds. Neal, with great cleverness,
<br/>and wit, and industry, has furnished hardly anything, except
<br/>a few critical sketches and moral essays, with a few brilliant
<br/>tales, that show how much more might have been accom-
<br/>plished. Neal could have been the first magazine writer of
<br/>his day; but he could never equal Dana, lacking, as he does,
<br/>the profound and subtle genius of the latter.</p>
         <p>In a general survey of the genius of Dana, we may remark
<br/>his defect of wit and humor. He sometimes indulges in
<br/>playful sarcasm, as in the letters from town (would he had
<br/>given us more), which are models of their kind—elegant,
<br/>familiar, and Addisonian, in the best sense—the natural union
<br/>of sense and gaiety, of reflection and feeling.</p>
         <p>Dana is a master of characters: his observation is keen
<br/>and benevolent, and can at the same time grapple with vig-
<br/>orous and strongly-marked characters. He has painted a
<br/>character in the First Letter, which somewhat resembles his
<br/>own; and which, together with the character of Edward,
<br/>and a few touches (of the maiden kind) in the youthful cha-
<br/>racter of Paul Felton, go to make up a pretty fair and just
<br/>idea of the author.</p>
         <p>Dana has more imagination than fancy, and which gives
<br/>his fictions the air of reality. He is too habitually serious to
<br/>be fanciful or fantastic. His imagination delights in tragic
<br/>situations, and dark characters, and terrible deeds, that carry
<br/>a fearful moral with them. His style is admirable; close,
<br/>clear, precise, final. He is equally powerful in his critical
<br/>capacity, as he is an original writer. His essays are musings,
<br/>the finest reflections of a scholar, and many given to reverie
<br/>and sentimental disquisition. The man, too, is but the natu-<div class="pagebreak" id="#page71"/>

            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>ral converse of the author—kind, sincere, honorable; with-
<br/>out a meanness, without a flaw—such is Richard H. Dana,
      <br/>one of our very best writers; one of our very best men.</p>

         <div class="head">BARBARITIES OF THE THEATRE.</div>
         <p>Dullness and absurdity are not the only or the least causes
<br/>of the decline and fall of the present Drama. The stage has
<br/>something to answer for, on the”score of positive inhumani-
<br/>ty. In Hogarth’s delightful print of the Strolling Players
<br/>behind the scenes, the characters are represented as preparing
<br/>for a burletta. The imperial Eagle of Jove is feeding one of
<br/>the bantlings of the company with pap out of his projected
<br/>talons; the tragedy Queen raves to the imaginary gods, while
<br/>a rent is getting stitched on her leg; two imps are quarrelling
<br/>for a pot of porter; a lady is pleasantly distressed at the ap-
<br/>pearance of her first pair of breeches, and reinforces her
<br/>courage with a glass of cordial; the mitre is filled with play
<br/>books, and a cat is tossing the royal globe on the floor as a
<br/>bauble. It is a very happy print to look at, for every charac-
<br/>ter in it, is steeped to the very crown in that sovereign bath
<br/>for the misfortunes of the world, the humor of a full overflow-
<br/>ing heart. But alas! the picture has its reverse, and the same
<br/>great master might have drawn upon the same scene for addi-
<br/>tional materials to his shuddering prints of the Four Stages
<br/>of Cruelty. He might have set his burletta in motion, and
<br/>anticipated a scene which has just occurred at Drury Lane,
<br/>and forms one of the most horrible realities, yet one so obvi-
<br/>ous that it may occur again, at any moment, of the theatrical
<br/>life. Miss Clara Webster, a dancer of ability and a favorite
<br/>with the audience, was performing in the opera of the Revolt
<br/>of the Harem, in the bath scene, where there is a miserable
<br/>attempt at the representation of water, and women bathing
<br/>in it, that, when we witnessed it at the Park Theatre, seemed
<br/>as natural and agreeable to the eye, as the stiff, tawdry.
<br/>French pictures smeared on band boxes. There is nothing
<br/>to be said against the indecency of such an exhibition, for it
<br/>was too painful and revolting to produce any other feeling
<br/>than an uncomfortable disgust. Painted actresses with star-
<br/>ing eyes, fixed on a narrow strip of foothold, like rope-walkers,
<br/>illuminated in a glare of light, like Dante’s figures in purga-
<br/>tory, offer the least attractive subject of contemplation in the
<br/>world. Miss Webster was engaged in this gross show of
<br/>tinsel, when her gauze dress took fire from the lights placed
<br/>below. She was immediately enveloped in flames, and ran
<br/>about the stage shrieking for help, avoided and shaken off by
<br/>the other dancers, at the peril of their lives, till the carpenter
<br/>at the side scene, rolled himself over her, and extinguished
<br/>the fire at the cost of great personal suffering to himself. She
<br/>was taken home to die—and the play went on to the conclu-
<br/>sion. This reads like a reflection on the humanity of an Eng-
<br/>lish audience. So it occurred. Yet, as they were men and
<br/>women, that vision, clad in fire, must rise up before them as
<br/>a horrible portent—the extremest agony of pain, lit up by the
<br/>blaze of a theatre. What light foot can tread the boards
<br/>again? This disaster will, doubtless, attract the attention of
<br/>men of sense and feeling, who busy themselves in England,
<br/>in all such cases, Sydney Smith may find a deeper horror,
<br/>and a more available subject for relief in this, than in the fa-
<br/>mous Railway Disaster with locked doors. A similar fatal
<br/>occurrence in France, vividly related by Froissart, took place
<br/>in a species of mummery and masking, at the Court of
<br/>Charles VI. <span class="anchor" id="a001">

         <p>It remains for theatrical managers to take the strictest pre-
<br/>cautions against the recurrence of similar accidents in future.
<br/>We have often noticed with alarm, the flaring of the foot-
<br/>lights at the very steps of the actresses. The lights should
<br/>be carefully protected, as recommended by the London Coro-
<br/>ner, with a net-work of wire, and as he exhibited, the dresses
<br/>might also be rendered incombustible. Such steps are sug-
<br/>gested, not only by humanity, but by the interests of managers.
<br/>An occurrence of the kind happening here, would damn the
<br/>boards of any theatre to perpetual infamy. The whole class
<br/>of dangerous theatrical performances should beat once modi-
<br/>fied and amended. There is little pleasure for the audience as
<br/>safety for the performers, in these exhibitions. Ellsler really
<br/>delights us by her grace of motion, and piquant archness in
<br/>walking across the stage; she simply shocks all agreeable
<br/>feeling when she transports herself on a wire, or hangs sus-
<br/>pended from the ceiling. The blue-lights and sulphur are a
<br/>nuisance which, out of the theatre, would be indictable at
<br/>common law. On what principle a manager fills the house
<br/>with soot and smoke, unless to give color to the assertions of
<br/>those pious people who maintain that the stage is the devil’s
<br/>portal, we are at a loss to conceive. Mr. Povey may, very mys-
<br/>teriously, by some unknown laws of assimilation, continue
<br/>to grow fat in such an atmosphere, but it is death to the au-
  <br/>dience.</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page72"/>
            
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>There is a host of minor grievances, each sufficient in it-
<br/>self to account for the general disappearance of the audiences,
<br/>without recurring to the unfortunate laws of the drama, for a
<br/>single argument. There is one sentiment that, we have ob-
<br/>served, always comes home to the house, and is delivered
<br/>with an air of perfect naturalness, by the actors. It is the
<br/>passage in Hamlet where “the air bites shrewdly—it is very
<br/>cold.” There is no mock unction in the player’s art here.
<br/>We should have no plays performed in winter but such as
<br/>Macbeth, Hamlet, and others lying in hyperborean regions, to
<br/>keep up the historical keeping which Mr. Macready so much
<br/>values. Masaniello, or the Tempest, are absurdities.</p>
         <p>Now we have a very great respect for the cast-iron stove at
<br/>the Park Theatre, with its open mouth in the lobbies, and the
<br/>pieces of coal, set on like oysters, to roast. It does something
<br/>to fill up a vacuum in the deserted hall, and it is society for
<br/>the door-keepers, who have frequently nothing else to look at;
<br/>but bless you! for all purposes of warming the Theatre, it
<br/>might as well be round the comer, or supply fuel for the politi-
<br/>cal bonfires in the Park. Within there is neither flue, nor fire,
<br/>or pipe visible or perceptible. It is a comfort even to see poor
<br/>Grandfather Whitehead warm his feeble fingers, in the per-
<br/>son of Mr. Chippendale, over the painted embers of Langley’s
<br/>inhospitable hearth. Pity the poor actors! We have seen a
<br/>strong current of air sweep the ribons of an actress’s hair, and
<br/>a star, too, round into her face, that she could scarcely sing
<br/>for the annoyance. Bare n ecks look pitiable in such northern
<br/>blasts. Oh “the pity of it, the pity of it,” Mr. William B.
<br/>Astor!</p>
         <p>There is another word to be said, too, of those curiously
<br/>contrived instruments of torture for the audience, the boxes,
<br/>which to gentlemen who have legs, recal the idea very sen-
<br/>sibly, of Ravaillac’s boots. The problem of what infinitesimal
<br/>quantity of straw will protect the covering of the seats from
<br/>too exhaustive a friction on the boards underneath, has been
<br/>very satisfactorily solved too. Verily, if a man goes to destruc-
<br/>tion through the gate of the theatre, he goes to it like a Po-
      <br/>pish anchorite, without ever treading the soft primrose path.</p>

         <div class="head">NATIONAL NOMENCLATURE.</div>
         <p>Our countrymen are very much in the habit of pointing to
<br/>the Patent Office in Washington to prove the fertility of the
<br/>inventive powers of the nation. But it would require a dozen
<br/>such collections to weigh against the contrary evidence of the
<br/>Blue Book. Combination is the word for the Patent Office.
<br/>Imagination or invention, we can lay no claim to, if we look
<br/>to our national nomenclature for the proof. In the immense
<br/>catalogue of American names, there is hardly one we can
<br/>claim as our own. They are all of foreign or Indian deriva-
<br/>tion. The inconceivable repetition of certain names of towns,
<br/>proves us to be the most unimaginative people in the whole
<br/>world. There are one hundred and eighteen towns and
<br/>counties in the United States, called Washington. In all
<br/>Europe, there is but one London; we have five Londons, one
<br/>New London, and seven Londonderrys. We have six towns
<br/>called Paris, tweny-one Richmonds, sixteen Bedfords, nine
<br/>Brightons, nine Chathams, eleven Burlingtons, sixteen Dela-
<br/>wares, fourteen Oxfords, fourteen Somersets, nine Cam-
<br/>bridges, twenty-five Yorks, and other English names in pro-
<br/>portion. There are twelve towns with the prefix of Big, four
<br/>Great, and sixteen Little. There are nine Harmonys, seven-
<br/>ty-eight Unions, and eighteen Concords; forty-four Libertys,
<br/>and thirteen Freedoms; twenty-one Columbias, and seven
<br/>Columbuses. There are one hundred and four towns and coun-
<br/>ties of the color Green, five Vermillions, and twenty-four
  
  <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>Browns. Almost every name in Scripture, has been repro-
<br/>duced on our soil: Goshens fifteen, Canaans eleven, Salems
<br/>thirty, Bethlehems eleven. All the classical writers have
<br/>been largely honored in our national baptisms: there are fif-
<br/>teen Miltons, five Homers, nine Addisons, two Byrons, two
<br/>Drydens, and only one Virgil. We have five Avons, three
<br/>Stratfords, one Romeo, and one Juliet, but no Shakspeare.
<br/>We have twelve Athenses, eight Romes, one Romulus, and
<br/>four Scipios. Of Troys we have sixteen. “Ilium fuit” need
<br/>be written no longer. We have six Sheffields, and twelve
<br/>Manchesters. There are one hundred and fifty towns and
<br/>counties called New Somethings and only six Old. The most
<br/>imaginative name on our roster, is Richland, which is multi-
<br/>plied no less than thirty-eight times, we have precisely the
<br/>same number of Springfields; and Bloomfields, and Green-
<br/>fields without number. Of Oranges there are twenty-six,
<br/>and not one Lemon. We have three Dresdens, fourteen Ber-
<br/>lins, twenty Hanovers, and four Viennas. All the cities
<br/>of the East are multiplied a great many times, with the
<br/>exception of Constantinople, in place of which, we have a
<br/>Constantine. The national habit of imitation is very strongly
<br/>shown in our names: there are few that occur but once.
<br/>Smallpox, a town in Joe Davies county, Illinois, stands alone
<br/>yet, or it did when the census was taken; so does the town
<br/>of Jim Henry, Miller county, Missouri; but they will, doubt-
<br/>less, be imitated before long. We have ninety-one Jacksons,
<br/>sixty-nine Jeffersons, fifty-eight Monroes, fifty Madisons, thir-
<br/>ty-two Harrisons, nineteen Adamses, sixteen Van Burens,
<br/>twenty-one Clays, three Websters, and not one Tyler. Of
<br/>Bentons there are fourteen, Franklins eighty-three, and La-
<br/>fayettes thirty-four. The popularity of an individual can
<br/>hardly be inferred from the number of limes his name occurs
<br/>on the map. Clinton is multiplied twenty-seven times, De-
<br/>catur nine, and Perry fifty-one.</p>
         <p>The indigenous shrubs and fruits of the country give names
<br/>to but few towns. The Pepperidge, one of the most beauti-
<br/>ful of our forest trees, has never been used at all, nor the
<br/>Persimmons; but we have a Willow and a great many Oaks.</p>
         <p>We have thought it would be a good way to compel the
<br/>country to tax its imagination, by passing a law prohibiting
<br/>the use of a name for a town or county that had ever been
<br/>used before for the same purpose; but such a law would
<br/>lead to worse consequences still, all our towns would then
<br/>be numbered, as our new streets are now, and we should
<br/>have Nine hundred and twenty-first city, Fifty-fourth county,
<br/>New York, and we should see letters directed to Eighty-fourth
<br/>city, Sixty-fifth street, Forty-first county. Sooner than live
<br/>in such an arithmetical world as that, we would infinitely
<br/>prefer a dozen Joe Davieses, and ninety-one Jacksons.</p>

         <div class="head">THE DEVICES OF BEGGARY.</div>
         <p>Mr. Bumble, the beadle in Oliver Twist, was very indig-
<br/>nant at a pauper, who went and starved himself to death, on
<br/>purpose to bring odium upon the parish overseers; and Mrs.
<br/>Corney, the matron of the poor house, made terrible com-
<br/>plaints that some old woman or other, always took it into her
<br/>head to die, just as she, (Mrs. Corney,) was going to take
<br/>a comfortable cup of tea. The poor are terrible bugbears to
<br/>the rich; little emaciated children and pallid old creatures,
<br/>with their rags fluttering in the winter wind, are forever in-
<br/>truding themselves upon the elegant repose of the well-off.
<br/>A clergyman, who published his complaints on this subject,
<br/>not long since, made a very feeling statement of his griefs,
<br/>in not being able to eat his breakfast in quiet, for the obtru-
<br/>siveness of street beggars, who would be asking for some-
  <div class="pagebreak" id="#page73"/> 
  
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>thing to eat. Probably they did not know his profession, or
<br/>they would have kept clear. That any man, woman, or
<br/>child ever begged, but from sheer necessity, for something to
<br/>eat, we do not believe. It is a very prevalent opinion, how-
<br/>ever, among the well-to-do, that beggars go about from sheer
<br/>wantonness, with crying infants in their arms, or with shrivel-
<br/>led limbs, on purpose to disturb the upper classes, by exciting
<br/>their sympathies. One day, last week, we saw a fat lawyer,
<br/>whose person was enclosed in a blue cloth cloak, with an
<br/>abundance of velvet, talking rather harshly to a little boy,
<br/>with some almanacs in his hand, standing in his bare feet on
<br/>the rugged ice of the pavement.</p>
         <p>“Look at this little rascal,” said the legal gentleman, “he
<br/>goes about without shoes or stockings, on purpose to make
<br/>people buy his almanacs.”</p>
         <p>The culprit was a beautiful little fellow, of some ten years
<br/>with a profusion of glossy hair, and a look of intelligence
<br/>which showed that he or his parents had seen better times.
<br/>His feet were the color of mahogany, and they looked as
<br/>though they were touched with the frost; his dress was ex-
<br/>ceedingly scant, but he had a very healthy look, notwith-
<br/>standing. Indeed I have rarely seen a prettier boy. In spite
<br/>of his rags, and destitution, he had such a look of happy in-
<br/>nocence, that I doubt not John Jacob Astor would gladly
<br/>have changed places with him, and given his twenty mil-
<br/>lions for the poor boy’s ruddy cheeks, bright eyes, and frosted
<br/>feet.</p>
         <p>“Is it true,” I asked, “that you go bare-footed to sell your
<br/>almanacs?”</p>
         <p>The little fellow blushed at the question, and looked
<br/>down at my boots, at which I blushed in return.</p>
         <p>“Indeed, I should be very glad to wear shoes, if I could
<br/>get them,” he said, “but it is more than a month since I have
<br/>had any. Perhaps it is some other boy that the gentleman
<br/>means.”</p>
         <p>"No, no, you are the very scamp,” persisted the lawyer.</p>
         <p>“There’s a boy boards with my mother, it may be him,”
<br/>continued the youngster.</p>
         <p>“Does your mother take boarders?” I inquired.</p>
         <p>“She takes this little boy, because he has got no mother,
<br/>and when he gets a shilling by selling almanacs, he gives it
<br/>to her. Will you buy one of my almanacs?”</p>
         <p>‘‘Don’t you;’’ said the lawyer, “depend upon it, he’s a
<br/>cheat.”</p>
         <p>“I hope he is,” I replied, “there’s something to be hoped
<br/>of a boy who can endure such hardships as this little fellow
<br/>does, for the sake of two or three cents profit on the sale of
<br/>an almanac. Just cast your eyes on the opposite side of the
<br/>street, and look at the sleek negro, dressed in a cocked hat,
<br/>and a laced coat, at the entrance of that fancy bazaar; what
<br/>do you think he wears that finery for? Is it not to entice
<br/>customers into his employer’s shop? Look a little further, at
<br/>those immense sheets of plate glass in a hatter’s window,
<br/>what do you think they are for? Solely to admit light, or to
<br/>induce customers to drop in? for what purpose do you carry
<br/>that bundle of tape-tied papers under your arm, if not to gain
<br/>clients, by persuading the world that you are overrun with
<br/>them, knowing as you do that it is the way of the world to
<br/>help the prosperous? And will you censure this little fellow
<br/>for practising the only arts that he possibly can, to attract
<br/>customers, by leaving off his shoes and stockings, this bitter
<br/>morning?”</p>
         <p>“Well, there’s something in that, I believe 1 will buy an

            <div class="head">THE RING.
  <br/>(TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF LUDWIG UHLER.)</div>
            <div class="byline">BY <span class="person">MARIA LOWELL</span>.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>There rode upon a morning
<br/>A knight across the lea,
<br/>Of his lady many a warning
<br/>And anxious thought had he.
<br/>"My little trusty ring of gold
<br/>From care can set me free;
<br/>In thee my loved one’s pledge I hold;
<br/>How stands her constancy?”
<br/>Now while he looks upon the ring,
<br/>It flies from off his hand,
<br/>It rolls and bounds with many a spring
<br/>Across the meadow land.
<br/>Across the meadow would he skim
<br/>To catch it as it flew,
<br/>But golden blossoms dazzle him,
<br/>And grass bedropped with dew.
<br/>The ring a falcon spieth
<br/>From off a linden tree;
<br/>And downward swiftly flieth,
<br/>The ring on high lifts he.
<br/>On mighty plumes his way doth take
<br/>In the free air to swing,
<br/>His brothers follow in his wake
<br/>To seize the little ring.
<br/>But none can win the little ring,
<br/>It drops adown the sky,
<br/>The knight he watch’t it falling
<br/>On the deep sea silently.
<br/>The fish are gaily dancing
<br/>To seize the golden prize,
<br/>But down the ring is glancing,
<br/>Beyond the reach of eyes.
<br/>“Oh little ring, in meadows fair
<br/>The flowers drew thee aside,
<br/>Oh little ring, in the blue air
<br/>The birds behind thee glide.
<br/>“Oh little ring, from ocean’s spring
<br/>Thou draw’st the fish above,
<br/>I fear thou tellest, little ring,
<br/>Strange news of her I love!”</div>

         <div class="head">The Drama.</div>
         <p>The Chatham.—Chatham street has been a favorite loca-
<br/>tion for theatres during the past twenty-five years. Since
<br/>Barriere had his Pavilion and lemonade garden, where the
<br/>Chatham street chapel afterwards stood, there have been
<br/>some half a dozen different Thespian temples erected in the
<br/>neighborhood. The first dramatic representation that we
<br/>ever witnessed was under Barriere’s management, and we
<br/>remember hearing a good many discussions among the fre-
<br/>quenters of that classic spot, about the relative merits of
<br/>Mrs. Entwistle and Mrs. Waring. It was here that Gene-
<br/>ral Morris, then only a colonel, produced his first Opera of
<br/>Briar Cliff, in which that immortal song was introduced,
<br/>“William was holding in his hand, &amp;c.” long before the days
<br/>of Henry Russell and the “Tree,” and long before “long
<br/>time ago,” even; here, too, Mr. Woodworth, the coadjutor
<br/>of the Brigadier in the Mirror, produced the beautiful native
<br/>Opera of the “Forest Rose,” and the celebrated Micah
<br/>Hawkins brought out some of his classic dramas. These
<br/>were the palmy days of the drama, when the celebrated <div class="pagebreak" id="#page74"/>

            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>Colonel Stevenson, since a tobacco inspector, kept the re-
<br/>freshment room and served drinks to the ladies who frequent-
<br/>ed that charming spot. But these days are gone, never more
<br/>to return, as some poet says. Mrs. Entwistle, we believe,
<br/>has been gathered to her fathers, and Mrs. Waring became
<br/>Mrs. Blake a long time since, and has doubtless grown old.
<br/>The beautiful Mrs. Wallack first unveiled her charms to the
<br/>public here, and the great Andrew Jackson Allen here made
<br/>his most brilliant displays of costumery. A low comedian
<br/>named Stevenson, used to give immense delight here by sing-
<br/>ing the favorite song “Such a beauty I did grow.” San-
<br/>quirico and De Begnis were then eating macaroni in Italy,
<br/>little dreaming that they would ever come to America and
<br/>sing comic songs in the Tabernacle. How destiny shuffles
<br/>men about, as though they were a pack of cards, excepting
<br/>that in cards there are as many kings as knaves, while
<br/>among men there are but few kings, and of knaves a good
<br/>many.</p>
         <p>The Chatham street people are essentially dramatic in
<br/>their character: they are exceedingly fond of theatrical dis-
<br/>play, as may be seen by walking through that renowned
<br/>thoroughfare any sun-shiny morning, or clear evening. Ev-
<br/>ery thing here has an air of exaggeration and caricature. It
<br/>was here that the big boot was first set up. You look in
<br/>vain lor repose or quiet. It appears, therefore, the most
<br/>natural thing in the world that a theatre of some kind should
<br/>always exist in Chatham street. The Park Theatre has
<br/>been closed, to make room for the classic equestrians, but
<br/>the Chatham is still devoted to the legitimate drama; what
<br/>that is we do not very clearly comprehend, but we believe
<br/>that tragedies and comedies in five divisions, which do not
<br/>represent real life, are generally called the legitimate dra-
<br/>ma. The prices of admission to the Chatham theatre are by
<br/>no means extravagant, a shilling being the price to the pit,
<br/>and two shillings to the dress circles. A corner of the pit is
<br/>partitioned off to form a saloon, at the entrance of which
<br/>hangs-a transparency, informing the patrons of the drama
<br/>that the best of liquors are sold within at three cents per
<br/>glass, and that pigs’ feet and soused tripe may be obtained at
<br/>the bar. This is all legitimate, of course; the city authori-
<br/>ties confer the privilege of selling the best of liquors at three
<br/>cents per glass to the youngsters who frequent this Thespian
<br/>temple, as a special license; and take part of the profits of
<br/>the same, to help support the rogues of one kind and another
<br/>that are made by such means. We thus see how regularly
<br/>and beautifully the cog-wheels of society are moved, appa-
<br/>rently giving motion to each other, without revealing the
<br/>power which sets the whole a-going. By way of antidote
<br/>to the “best of liquors,” the theatrical decorator has made
<br/>an imitation of the entrances of the House of Detention in the
<br/>two ornamental doors at the sides of the proscenium, which
<br/>seem to say to the youngsters in the pit, “take care!”
<br/>This is a very happy idea, and the Egyptian style of archi-
<br/>tecture harmonises very well with the other parts of the
<br/>house, particularly the view of West Point on the drop cur-
<br/>tain, which contains some very remarkable examples of draw-
<br/>ing in perspective.</p>
         <p>We heard a very eloquent sermon a Sabbath or two since,
<br/>on the destitution of the Turcomans in respect of good books.
<br/>The preacher, who was a bishop, shewed himself perfectly
<br/>familiar with the reading of the Sultan’s subjects, and begged
<br/>very hard for aid to send them something better. We won-
<br/>der whether there be a licentiate, or a doctor of divinity in this
<br/>great city, who has ever troubled himself to inquire into the
<br/>nature of the mental food which is nightly administered to
<br/>the young care-for-naughts, who fill the pit and galleries of
<br/>this theatre? Yet it is surely of as much importance, in
        
<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>every respect, that the apprentices and newspaper boys of
<br/>our city should be rightly instructed, as the learned barbari-
<br/>ans of the east. These boys may possibly go to church once
<br/>a week, but they go to the theatre every night. It is admit-
<br/>ted that the stage is the most powerful method of enforcing
<br/>a moral truth; and we do not see why some of those bene-
<br/>volent souls who bestow so much consideration upon the
<br/>production of tracts to be circulated at home and abroad,
<br/>should not give some attention to the amusements of the des-
<br/>titute youth of our city. It is one of the best and most com-
<br/>mendable designs of “young England,” to elevate the amuse-
<br/>ments of the poor, and to furnish them with the means of ra-
<br/>tional enjoyment to entice them from the ale-house and the
<br/>ring. There are sometimes highly objectional representa-
<br/>tions put upon the stage, which must hare an injurious ef-
<br/>fect, beyond calculation, on the morals of the young who wit-
<br/>ness them. If some of the publications of the tract society
<br/>were dramatised, we have no doubt that they would be
<br/>highly popular. What people admire most is novelty; and
<br/>a religious drama, divested of sectarian cant, would possess
<br/>this charm in a high degree. The popular taste may easily
<br/>be discovered by watching the causes of popular approbation;
<br/>and we have always remarked, that among audiences like
<br/>those of the Chatham, the best sentiments and the most vir-
<br/>tuous actions receive the warmest applause.</p>
         <p>Bulwer’s Lady of Lyons was recently played here to a
<br/>crowded house, and the virtuous sentiments contained in it
<br/>produced rounds of applause. We could not but feel vexed
<br/>that the author had so spoilt an admirable moral, one so
<br/>well adapted to benefit an audience of apprentices, in misre-
<br/>presenting the true story upon which his drama was found-
<br/>ed. La Perouse, or the Bellows-Mender, was the tale which
<br/>he worked into a play; bnt by changing the course of ac-
<br/>tion, by which the hero raised himself from poverty, he en-
<br/>tirely destroyed the beauty of the moral, and rendered his
<br/>drama much less effective than it would have been, if he
<br/>had adhered to the integrity of the narrative. La Perouse,
<br/>the original of Claude Melnotte, to prove himself worthy of
<br/>the wife whom he had unworthily won, goes to Paris, and
<br/>by industry and strict integrity in trade acquires a fortune,
<br/>and returns to claim his bride, who has retired to a convent;
<br/>but Bulwer has made him a soldier, who makes himself rich
<br/>by robbing the Italians, and returns after two years of but-
<br/>chery and plunder, tricked out in epaulettes and plumes, and
<br/>rescues his bride just as she is about to sell herself for mo-
<br/>ney to his rival, after having sworn fidelity to her first hus-
<br/>band. The whole teaching of his play is mischievous, and
<br/>the sentiment of it exceedingly mawkish. As a work of art,
<br/>the Lady of Lyons does not rise above the low standard of
<br/>the conventionalities of the stage. People make long ha-
<br/>rangues at the elbows of others, who conveniently remain
<br/>deaf and blind to all that passes, until the proper time comes
<br/>for them to open their ears and eyes. Claude Melnotte re-
<br/>turns from Italy after an absence of nearly two years, and is
<br/>not recognised by his wife during a long conversation, because
<br/>it would disturb the denouement of the plot if he were to do
<br/>so. There are, in truth, as many gross inconsistencies in the
<br/>drama now, as in the days of Nick Bottom. While, in all
<br/>other departments of art improvements have been made to
<br/>meet the exactions of a critical age, the stage has remained
<br/>unchanged for the last two hundred years; we do not mean
<br/>in the machinery of the stage, which is of no account, but in
<br/>the construction of the drama, which is every thing. If
<br/>Shakspeare could be laid on the shelf for half a century, an
<br/>incubus would be removed from the drama, and it would
<br/>rise to a level with the other arts.</p>

            <div class="head">LETTER FROM DR. A. SIDNEY DOANE.</div>
            <div class="ab">New York, Jan. 23, 1845.
  <br/>To the Editor of the Broadway Journal.</div>
            <p>Sir,—On the 16th of January I was requested by my friend
<br/>Dr. S. Vital Bodinier, recently from Paris, to witness the
<br/>extirpation of a humor from the neck of a female, which he
<br/>said would be performed without her consciousness, and
<br/>without suffering, “while she was in a magnetic sleep," he
<br/>having operated twice under similar circumstances in Paris,
<br/>and with success.</p>
            <p>Being rather incredulous, but at the same time extremely
<br/>anxious to see so great a boon conferred upon suffering hu-
<br/>manity, I went to No. — Chambers street, previous to the
<br/>hour appointed for the operation (which was half-past one),
<br/>in order to witness the process of putting the female to sleep.
<br/>After being in the house about five minutes, the patient came
<br/>into the basement room and seated herself in an easy chair.
<br/>She seemed extremely bright and nowise sleepy, with a rosy
<br/>cheek, black eyes, and dark hair. After an inquiry or two
<br/>as to her health, and feeling her pulse, which was natural,
<br/>Dr. B. proceeded to make what are termed “magnetic pass-
<br/>es,” and so successfully, that in five minutes the eyelids
<br/>drooped, and in ten minutes—say at twenty minutes of twelve
<br/>—she was sound asleep. I learned from Dr. B. that she
<br/>had been placed in this state some ten or twelve times pre-
<br/>viously, with a view to secure her entire insensibility. Dr.
<br/>Bodinier now demonstrated on the female the operation to
<br/>be performed, and requested me to examine the tumor. It
<br/>was a lymphatic tumor in the parotid region, which had ex-
<br/>isted for five years, but had increased very rapidly within a
<br/>few months. I left the patient at twelve o’clock, still sleep-
<br/>ing soundly.</p>
            <p>I returned to the house at quarter past one, in company
<br/>with Prof. J. W. Francis and Mr. J. S. Redfield, the pub-
<br/>lisher. A few moments after, we were joined by Drs. Mott,
<br/>Belafield, J. Kearney Rodgers, Taylor, Nelson, Dr. Alfaro,
<br/>a highly distinguished physician from Madrid, Mr. Parmly
<br/>the dentist, and one or two others. Descending to the base-
<br/>ment, we found the patient still asleep, a fact of which I
<br/>believe all the medical gentlemen present were satisfied.
<br/>Every thing being arranged, Dr. Bodinier stated briefly that
<br/>the operation would be neither rapid nor brilliant, on ac-
<br/>count of the facial nerve, the division of which caused great
<br/>deformity. He then with a convex bistoury made an incision
<br/>two inches long, beginning below the lobule of the ear, dis-
<br/>sected the tumor from its lateral attachments, separated it
<br/>from the subjacent parts with the blunt edges of a pair of
<br/>curved scissors, and removed it; it was the size of a pullet’s
<br/>egg, and the operation occupied two and a half minutes only.
<br/>During this operation I stood at the head of the patient.
<br/>There was not the slightest change in her face or respiration;
<br/>she continued to sleep on quietly and calmly through the
<br/>whole of it. Dr. Bodinier seemed to be operating rather
<br/>upon a cadaveo than on a living being. The wound was
<br/>now dressed, and the patient still remaining unconscious,
<br/>previous to the departure of the gentlemen who witnessed
<br/>the operation, Dr. B. invited them to return and see the pa-
<br/>tient roused. I availed myself of the invitation, and went
<br/>again to the house at ten minutes past four. She was still
<br/>sleeping, but at quarter past four, the time indicated, she was
<br/>demagnetized by Dr. B., Drs. Taylor, Parmly, and others
<br/>being present. I immediately inquired, “How she felt?”
<br/>She answered, “rather tired.” “Had she suffered during
<br/>her sleep?” She said, “No.” “Had she been cut?” She
    
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>replied “ No, the operation was to be performed the next
<br/>day,” as Dr. B. had previously stated to her would be the
<br/>case. She was now shown the tumor, at which she seemed
<br/>much surprised and gratified., Since that time the patient has
<br/>recovered rapidly, and to-day, Thursday, one week since the
<br/>operation, the wound is entirely healed, and she has resumed
<br/>her duties in the family.</p>
            <p>The operation was performed very skilfully, and Dr. B.
<br/>justified the high expectations formed of him, by his great
<br/>reputation in Europe, and the manner in which Prof. Berard,
<br/>of the Hospital La Pitie, the celebrated Orfila, Dean of the
<br/>Faculty of Medicine, and the illustrious Guizot, Minister of
<br/>Foreign Affairs, have spoken of him in their letters to this
<br/>country.</p>
            <p>This, however, is not the only case in which surgical
<br/>operations have been performed, the patient being in a mag-
<br/>netic sleep. Some six years since, a schirrous breast was
<br/>extirpated at Paris by Prof. J. Cloquet, the details of which
<br/>were communicated by him to the “Academie Royale.” Dr.
<br/>Bodinier also, as we have already stated, operated twice in
<br/>June last, at Paris, successfully. Some two years since a
<br/>leg was amputated at Bangor, and lately I see by the papers
<br/>that at Augusta, a tumor has been removed from the breast.</p>
            <p>I have thus complied with your request to state what I
<br/>witness solely from a sense of justice to the distinguished
<br/>surgeon who performed the operation. I have told you
<br/>what I saw. You can draw your own conclusions.</p>
            <div class="ab">Respectfully yours,
    <br/>32 Warren Street.</div>

            <div class="head">THE MOZART-INSTITUTE OF FRANKFORT - ON - THE - MAINE.</div>
            <p>On the loth of February, 1828, a society of Amateurs was
<br/>formed in Frankfort, under the name of the “ Lieder-Kranz,”
<br/>Wreath of Songs; partly for social intercourse, but mainly
<br/>for the practice of Vierstimmigen Mannergesang, quartette
<br/>chorusses, songs composed for four male voices, first and se-
<br/>cond tenor and first and second bass. As every thing new in
<br/>art or literature creates a sensation in modem times, it was
<br/>very natural that the performances of the Lieder-Kranz
<br/>should cause a considerable excitement. The society conti-
<br/>nued for several years to prosecute its objects, and by the
<br/>amount of its fine talents and a continual striving after the
<br/>most classical compositions, it ventured at last to give a
<br/>public performance. It did so on several occasions, prompted
<br/>by a holy desire to honor the greatest poets of the fatherland,
<br/>Schiller and Goethe; to do honor to the European master of
<br/>sound, Mozart; and to make a thank-offering to the immor-
<br/>tal Guttenberg. It did so, too, to gratify the feelings of the
<br/>heart for the sufferings of others, and to turn the natural sym-
<br/>pathy for misfortune to productive effect.</p>
            <p>The satisfaction shown by the public at these performan-
<br/>ces, was the best acknowledgment of their merit; at the
<br/>same time, it gave an impulse to the perfection of the Ger-
<br/>man Mannergesang; and finally, it was an exhortation to
<br/>unite with the whole Fatherland in a grand national vocal
<br/>festival. The Lieder-Kranz entertained the joyful hope, that
<br/>its intentions would everywhere be received with eagerness.</p>
            <p>Its object was not by this Festival to prepare a mere pass-
<br/>ing enjoyment for the participators, but to lay the corner-
<br/>stone of an imperishable institution. The proceeds of the
<br/>Vocal Festival were to be appropriated to the foundation of
<br/>a Musical Institute, to be called the “Mozart-Stiftung;" in-
<br/>tending thereby to erect a moral monument to the greatest
<br/>tone-poet of the world. The first performance of the Lieder
<br/>Kranz for the benefit of the Mozart Institute, took place at
<br/>Frankfort in July, 1838, and the constitution of the society <div class="pagebreak" id="#page76"/>

               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>provided that an annual concert should be given by the Lie-
<br/>der-Kranz for the same purpose.</p>
            <p>The Constitution of the “Mozart-Stiftung” consists of
<br/>forty sections, detailing the manner in which its objects shall
<br/>be attained, the principal of which are the education of
<br/>youthful musical talent, and the production of musical com-
<br/>positions. Youths of all countries, where the German lan-
<br/>guage is spoken, can receive the aid of the Institute, provi-
<br/>ded that their lives are blameless, and their musical talents
<br/>respectable.</p>
            <p>It was natural that all artists glowing with a true love for
<br/>this science, should contribute, either by concerts or by their
<br/>compositions, to the perfection of the Mozart Stiftung, and
<br/>the completion of this admirable work. The noble Franz
<br/>Litzt was one of the first who gave concerts for the benefit
<br/>of the institute; among other contributors we find the names
<br/>of Spohr, Ferdinand Hiller, Mangold. Dr. Felix Mendelssohn-
<br/>Bartholdy, the composer of the Lobgesang, has promised to
<br/>write six Vierstimmigc Mannergesange for the benefit of the
<br/>institution. Franz Litzt has given it four imposing choruses.
<br/>The highly-esteemed Schnyder Von Wartensee, one of the
<br/>honorary members of the Lieder-Kranz, gave the institute a
<br/>sum of money for the formation of a particular fund for the
<br/>purchase of classical music. This happened very oppor-
<br/>tunely, for they were enabled to purchase thereby a great
<br/>part of the works of Sebastian Bach from the estate of (alas,
<br/>too early dead!) John Nep. Schelble, the worthy founder of
<br/>the “Cecilien Verein” in Frankfort. From New York, also,
<br/>the sum of one hundred and sixty florins was sent to the Mo-
<br/>zart Institute by friends of the cause.</p>
            <p>Slowly, but surely, this magnificent work approaches to
<br/>completion, and the joyful consciousness of a noble deed will
<br/>compensate its high-hearted founders for the indefatigable
<br/>zeal which they have shown in their interest for the German
    <br/>National Monument—the Mozart-Stiftung.</p>

            <div class="head">PLACES WORTH VISITING.</div>
            <p>The Governor’s Room in the City Hall.—The suite of
<br/>rooms in the City Hall, called the Governor’s Room, can be
<br/>visited, free of cost, at any time of day, by application to the
<br/>keeper. The chief attraction here, consists of the pictures,
<br/>of which there are a good many, mostly authentic portraits.
<br/>The Mayors of the city are all here, of the common kit-cat
<br/>size; and the Governors of the State are represented at full
<br/>length. The best picture among them all, is the portrait of
<br/>Governor Yates, by Vanderlyn. It is the best that he ever
<br/>painted; superior, in truth, to his Caius Marius. It proves
<br/>that the only true historical painting, is portraiture. The best
<br/>painted head in the collection, perhaps the best in the country,
<br/>is the portrait of Governor Marcy, by Page; the general ef-
<br/>fect is inferior to some others in the room, owing to an ill-
<br/>disposed flag suspended over the head of the Governor, and an
<br/>uncomfortable prominence which is given to a ponderous
<br/>table cover; but in other respects it is an admirable painting;
<br/>one that does honor to the arts in this country, and which
<br/>should be seen by every foreigner who would form a just esti-
<br/>mate of the advance of art among us. There are also two por-
<br/>traits, by Inman; one, the most elaborate of all his pictures,
<br/>of Mr. Van Buren; the other, one of his most free and dash-
<br/>ing subjects, of Governor Seward. Here, too, is a full length
<br/>portrait of Lafayette, painted by Mr. Morse, the President of
<br/>the National Academy; it is a very passable portrait, but the
<br/>most unnatural piece of coloring that was ever seen. But its
<br/>merit as a painting will always be of secondary interest; as
<br/>a portrait of a man, whose name will ever be dear to an
    
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>American, it will seem full of grandeur and beauty. It is
<br/>much superior to the portrait which hangs in the House of
<br/>Representatives at Washington.</p>
            <p>Some of the most interesting pictures here, are the portraits
<br/>of the heroes of our last war; may it ever remain the last!
<br/>Those of Perry and Hull, particularly,are very spirited, though
<br/>not to be commended as mere works of art. The citizens of
<br/>New York pay a good round price for these pictures, and they
<br/>should avail themselves oftener than they do, of their right to
<br/>inspect them. The children of the charity schools in London,
<br/>have the privilege of visiting the lions in the Tower, free of
<br/>charge; and the children of our Public Schools should be
<br/>allowed to visit the Governor’s Room on a certain day of the
<br/>week. It is the only free gallery in the city, and should be
<br/>made the most of.</p>

            <div class="head">WALL STREET ARCHITECTURE.</div>
            <p>A block of brick stores has just been built upon the site
<br/>of the old Wall Street Church, in which a novelty in street
<br/>architecture has been introduced, that will probably be exten-
<br/>sively copied hereafter. It consists of clustered pillars and
<br/>gothic ornaments, the effect of which is by no means unplea-
<br/>sant. There is now every possible style of architecture in
<br/>Wall Street, excepting only the Egyptian. There are sphinx-
<br/>es at the entrance of some of the banks, we believe, which
<br/>must be owned area very suitable emblem for such a purpose.
<br/>The Cyclopean is the favorite style in this region; and it ap-
<br/>pears to have been adopted to give an impression of stability
<br/>to the corporations which do their business in the buildings.
<br/>Herodotus relates an anecdote of a certain king who employed
<br/>an architect to build him a treasury for his wealth, which it
<br/>should be secure from thieves. But the architect left a stone
<br/>loose in the building by which means he and his son entered
<br/>it and stole the king’s gold. The public should not place too
<br/>great faith in these Cyclopean structures in Wall street, lest
<br/>there be a loose stone somewhere, through which the con-
<br/>tents of the vaults may be abstracted. There are two build-
<br/>ings in Wall street, which are probably the costliest that
<br/>were ever built in any part of the world; the Custom House
<br/>and the Exchange. One is a mountain of granite and the
<br/>other of marble. They will doubtless stand forever, monu-
<br/>ments of the inefficiency of mere money to produce anything
<br/>great in art without the assistance of knowledge or genius.</p>

            <p>Catalogue of the Mercantile Library in New York,
<br/>1844.—The library of this all-important institution now con-
<br/>tains 21,000 volumes, the use of which can be had for the
<br/>mere trifle of two dollars the year. We are surprised to
<br/>learn that the members of the association do not increase
<br/>more rapidly. Every merchant in the city should see
<br/>that his clerks are all subscribers to it; and where they
<br/>cannot afford it, it would be to the interest of the em-
<br/>ployer to present the employed with the necessary funds.
<br/>The present Catalogue is divided into three parts. In the
<br/>first, works are arranged in alphabetical order, under their au-
<br/>thors’ names, or, if anonymous, under the leading word in
<br/>the title. In the second, they are classified under general
<br/>heads, which are themselves arranged alphabetically. The
<br/>Classified Catalogue forms an index to the Alphabetical Cat-
<br/>alogue, and reference can readily be made from the former to
<br/>the latter, as the first word in the title of every book is the
<br/>same in both. Biographies, only, stand, in the body of the
<br/>Catalogue, under their authors’ names, and, in the index, un-
<br/>der the names of their subjects. The third part, or Appendix,
<br/>comprises Novels, which are not in the other divisions of the
<br/>Catalogue.</p>

            <p>The Difference.—The Chimes, by Dickens, was sold in
<br/>London at a dollar and a quarter; it is sold here at a six-
<br/>pence. The London edition is better printed, of course,
<br/>and better bound, with gilt edges, and illustrations; but the
<br/>illustrations are by no means good ones, although they are
<br/>by such celebrated artists as Maclise and Leech. The
<br/>book is about equal to a shilling volume, and the publisher
<br/>and author divide the enormous profits on the sale of the
<br/>Work between them—which is right and proper. Such a
<br/>book, so published, in the United States would not sell at
<br/>all. We doubt whether one copy could be disposed of at
<br/>such a price. Two of our publishers paid thirty dollars each
<br/>for their copies, to the importer; they issued their editions
<br/>at the lowest possible fraction—four cents to the trade; and
<br/>the next day the entire book was reprinted by a newspaper
<br/>publisher and sold for two cents. Knavery and swindling
<br/>can descend no lower. But this is neither knavery nor swin-
<br/>dling, but fair and legal trade; by which nobody makes any
<br/>thing, and all for the want of a copyright law. Lawrie Todd
<br/>states that Galt got three thousand guineas from the sale of
<br/>the book of that name; we are informed that Mary Clavers,
<br/>the author of two very popular books, has not received fif-
<br/>teen hundred dollars for all that she has ever written. One
<br/>of the publishing houses that paid thirty dollars for an early
<br/>copy of the Chimes, had the MS. of an original work by an
<br/>American author of established reputation, whose writings
<br/>have been extensively republished in England, offered to
<br/>them gratis, upon condition of their publishing it, and they
<br/>declined it.</p>

<br/>D. Appleton A Co., 200 Broadway. No. 1, pp. 158. Price 25 cents.</p>
            <p>The merits of Michelet, as a historical writer, are too universally
<br/>well known to require any commendation at this time. The need of a
<br/>work like this has long been felt among English readers, and the
<br/>American publishers have conferred an obligation upon the public by
<br/>the issue of this marvellously cheap edition of a desirable work. The
<br/>present number contains 158 pages in double columns of neatly print-
<br/>ed matter. The end of the second book, included in this number,
<br/>reaches to the time of Hugh Capet, and the third begins with a geo.
<br/>graphical picture of France. This cannot fail to be a profitable publi-
<br/>cation, for even though the publisher should reap no profit from it, the
<br/>public will. We have but one charge to prefer against the publica-

            <p>A new edition of a very popular work. Mrs. Clavers was a resi-

<br/>resident of this city.</p>
            <p>As a narrative writer she deserves a place at the head of American
<br/>female authors, and as a delineator of character she is greatly in ad-

<br/>nothing but an occasional sketch in a magazine; but the materials
<br/>for a book are as abundant in our high-ways, as m the by-ways of
<br/>the west. And we hope to see an announcement before long, of a
<br/>work from her hand, sketching the peculiarities of city life, wherein
<br/>she would be free to exercise her fine powers of observation, without
<br/>the fear of displeasing one of their high mightinesses, the editors of
<br/>the pictorial magazines. It is not a little remarkable that these gen-

<br/>of eight and fourteen, and it contains too many local allusions, we
<br/>should think, to prove a very profitable book for readers of the same

<br/>has several entirely unpronounceable names in it, which will render it
<br/>less acceptable to those for whom it was designed than it would other-

<br/>and most idiomatic English in their reading. In other respects it is a

<br/>ingly mortified to hear him abused by our countrymen, who appear to
<br/>have strangely misunderstood his character. Captain Marryatt is a
<br/>genuine sailor; there’s nothing about him but suffers a sea change.
<br/>He must not be judged by the standards by which other men are
<br/>measured. As a delineator of the sailor character, he has never been
<br/>approached, but they are not sailors only that he has delineated;
<br/>sailor’s wives, children, tradesmen, in short, all who live by naviga-
<br/>tion, from the bum-boat women to the ship carpenter, are all pre-
<br/>sented in his pages with the truthfulness of a daguerreotype. His
<br/>stories are all clumsily constructed, but we read them, not for the sake

         <p>The New York Vocal Society.—After endeavoring to correct ex-
<br/>isting abuses, the next duty of a journalist is to call the attention of
<br/>the public to any thing which may be in operation for its benefit ox
<br/>amusement. We regret to say that even when awakened, the public
<br/>is but too often neglectful of much that is truly excellent, unless it
<br/>happens to hit decidedly the taste or fashion of the moment, irrespec-
<br/>tive of its merits or its tendency. Such is the case, unfortunately, with
<br/>the Society in question, for although its objects are of the highest mu-
<br/>sical importance, and its performance fully equal to the noble works
<br/>it executed, yet it has asked in vain for public sympathy and support.
<br/>We cannot account for this lukewarmness, otherwise than that it has
<br/>not yet become the fashion to admire classical Vocal Music. To repine
<br/>at this want of appreciation, is vain; to remonstrate, useless; we can
<br/>only hope that taste will be of a rapid and healthy growth, far out-
<br/>stripping the petty brushwood and creeping parasites, which encumber
<br/>it with rank luxuriance.</p>
         <p>The Vocal Society was founded in the early part of the year 1843.
<br/>Mr. George Loder, we believe, originated the idea, and on suggesting
<br/>it to some musical friends, a meeting of the profession was called, and
<br/>after some discussion, it was determined to establish a society, for the
<br/>purpose of practising and performing the highest class of Vocal Con-
<br/>certed Music, whether Glees, Quartettes, &amp;c., or Chorusses. The So-
<br/>ciety to be called the New York Vocal Society, and to consist of Pro-
<br/>fessors of Music, with a due proportion of amateurs, Ladies and Gen-
<br/>tlemen. Both professor and amateurs to be vocalists, of course. A
<br/>Constitution was then formed, and the Society met for practice, after
<br/>electing a President, in the person of Fanning C. Tucker, Esq.</p>
         <p>Having seen it fairly started upon its doubtful voyage, we will exa-
<br/>mine the materials of which it was composed, for upon these depended
<br/>its durability and the success of its undertaking. Among the Ladies of
<br/>the orchestra, were Mrs. Edw. Loder, Mrs. Burkhardt, Mrs. Weiden-
<br/>hoffer, Mrs. W. A. King, the Misses Watson, DeLuce, Cumming,
<br/>Windmuller, &amp;c. Among the gentlemen, were Messrs. G. Loder,
<br/>Timm, H. C. Watson, Alpers, W. A. King, Beames, Maynard, Mas-
<br/>sett, Kyle, J. A. Kyle, Ensign, Ives, Reiff, with many others, equal in
<br/>every way to their duties.</p>
         <p>From such an array of names, it would appear to us that the public
<br/>should have placed unlimited confidence in the stability and sterling
<br/>excellence of the undertaking, to which these names were appended
<br/>as a guarantee. But on glancing over the list, the eye dwelt not upon
<br/>a long array of Madames and Signors! they were, alas! but simple
<br/>Mistress, Miss, or Mister! Was it to be credited that any vocal mu-
<br/>sic worth the hearing, could proceed from throats neither Italianized
<br/>nor Frenchified—in short, from throats where the nightingale never
<br/>nestled? The idea could not for one moment be entertained; and so
<br/>the Vocal Society was left to struggle, unaided and unsheltered by
<br/>public fostering, against every difficulty. It did struggle, however, and
<br/>manfully too, for, by the self-sacrifice of the principal professors, as-
<br/>sisted by the amateur members, and some twenty subscribers, (we
<br/>should like to publish their names, that they might be honored as true
<br/>lovers of music) four admirable Concerts were given in 1843-4, and the
<br/>first season concluded, leaving the Society free from debt. This was
<br/>a great achievement, considering the adverse circumstances; but the
<br/>Society had made nothing: no dividend was paid to the actual members,
<br/>and the hopeful spirit (a vile spirit of gain!) was dead in the breasts of
<br/>many of them, and their interest in the Society (monied interest) had
<br/>ceased forever. Had there been but a dividend of two dollars each, it
<br/>would have served to have kept up the spirit of hope among the mer-
<br/>cenary, and have induced them to cling to the Society for the shadowy
<br/>chances of the future. Those who sacrificed time and money to sus-
<br/>tain the character of the Society, were by no means disheartened.
<br/>they did not labor for a consideration; the Art and its interests anima-
<br/>ted their endeavors throughout, and neither the want of appreciation
<br/>in the public, nor the lukewarmness, and even treachery of some of its
<br/>own body, could induce them to slacken their efforts in what they
<br/>deemed a just cause.</p>
         <p>We will give a brief account of the works which were performed at
<br/>the four Concerts of this Society. Some twenty of the finest English
<br/>and Italian madrigals were performed in a manner never equalled in
<br/>this country; several exquisite glees, both English and German; two
<br/>grand pieces, called Psalms, by Spohr, beside selections from the Last
<br/>Judgment, and smaller pieces by the same great composer; a wonder-
<br/>ful composition called the Forty Second Psalm, and an exquisite Ave
<br/>Maria, by Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, also pieces by Haydn, Hum-
<br/>mel, Weber, and many other great names. The most important of <div class="pagebreak" id="#page79"/>

            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>these pieces were produced by the Vocal Society for the first time in
<br/>this country, which would in any other land he more than sufficient to
<br/>establish firmly its high character in the public estimation. The vocal
<br/>performances, as may be imagined from the well-known abilities of its
<br/>members, were admirable in every respect. All the competent judges
<br/>Who attended the concerts, were unanimous in saying, that concerted
<br/>vocal music had never before been heard to such perfection in this
    <br/>country.	</p>
         <p>We shall, in a future number, discuss its prospects for this its second
<br/>season, and place in a prominent view its advantages as a school for
<br/>classical music.</p>

         <div class="ab">Dear Mr. Editor.</div>
         <p>My brother did not expect that you would print his letter about
<br/>the boys, and we have had the laugh on him all the week; they have
<br/>been at a Polka party every night since, which has made him dread-
<br/>fully out of temper. But I tell him that there is a certain quantity of
<br/>nonsense in every man, and that it is much better it should evaporate
<br/>in his youth, when frivolousness seems natural, than to be locked up
<br/>by restraint until he gets old, and then burst out when nobody expects
<br/>it. For my own part, I despise a frivolous old man, as much as I do a
<br/>grave young one; and I am well pleased to see the boys follow the
<br/>course of nature, and dance before they get too heavy. Of all things
<br/>] dislike to see a stout old gentleman in a cotillion.</p>
         <p>But there is one thing, Mr. Editor, which I wish you would attend
<br/>to—Punning. A gentleman who visits our house, puns about every-
<br/>thing. I cannot open my mouth, but he answers me with a pun. I am
<br/>sure it is dreadful uncivil; don’t you think so? Dr. Johnson, I have
<br/>been told, said that a man who would make a pun upon another’s name
<br/>would pick a pocket. And really, the gentleman I allude to, makes
<br/>such dreadful puns about everybody, that I have thought it best to
<br/>lock up all my trinkets whenever he calls upon us. Can’t you write
<br/>something very severe about this vile habit? I am afraid that I shall
<br/>fall into it myself, if I admit the punning gentleman into my company
<br/>any more. I have written off a long list of his puns, which I mean to
<br/>send you, to satisfy you of the enormity of his offence. What makes
<br/>it more singular, is the fact, that none of us ever laugh at his puns, al-
<br/>though he always laughs himself. Your friend,</p>

         <div class="lg">
            <br/>In search of brighter clime or sky
<br/>Still let the restless wanderer roam,
<br/>No fairer meets the painter’s eye
<br/>Than mantles o’er our English home.
<br/>Green are our woods, and sweeter stream!
<br/>Ne’er onward rolled in brighter beams.
<br/>More varied scenes what land can boast,
<br/>From castled craig to mountain vale?
<br/>Field, forest, sea-encircled coast,
<br/>The pencil charm: the pictured tale
<br/>Of sun and shade, of shifting skies,
<br/>No fairer clime than ours supplies.
<br/>Dear is the woodland cot, where trees,
<br/>Low bending o’er the rushy brook,
<br/>Fling their wild branches to the breeze,
<br/>Around the hereditary nook;
<br/>While chequered sunbeams trembling throw
<br/>Above the thatch, a golden glow.
<br/>If to thine eye be dearer still
<br/>The riven craig or crumbling wall.
<br/>The leaping foam from mountain rill,
<br/>Or deepest glen or loftiest fall,
<br/>Or hoary castle, dim and gray,
<br/>That mournful mocks the eye of day;
<br/>Turn to the wilds in northern land,
<br/>Whose circling mountains shroud the sky—
<br/>From snowy wreath and icy band,
<br/>Mysterious grandeur frowns on high—
<br/>Ben Nevis hoarsely shouts aloud,
<br/>And Lomond answers from its cloud.
<br/>Fill from the farthest spring of Thames,
<br/>And pledge Old England’s wide domain;
<br/>Fill to the high and honoured names
<br/>Which Genius hallows—not in vain—
<br/>Since bounding hearts in worship burn,
<br/>Before each consecrated urn.</div>

         <p>"It fortuned that a marriage was made in the king’s house between a
            <br/>young knight of Vermandois and one of the Queen’s gentlewomen; and be-
            <br/>cause they were both of the king’s house, the king’s uncles, and other lords,
            <br/>ladies, and damsels made great triumph; there were the dukes of Orleans,
            <br/>Berry, and Burgundy, and their wives, dancing and making great joy. The
            <br/>king made a great supper to the lords and ladies, and the queen kept her
            <br/>estate, desiring everyone to be merry : and there was a squire of Normandy,
            <br/>called Hogreymen of Gensay, who advised to make some pastime. The day
            <br/>of the marriage, which was on a Tuesday before Candelmas, he provided for
            <br/>a mummery against night: he devised six coats made of linen cloth, covered
            <br/>with pitch, and thereon flax like hair, and had them ready in a chamber. The
            <br/>king put on one of them, and the Earl of Jouy, a young lusty knight, another,
            <br/>and Sir Charles Poictiers the third, who was son to the Earl of Valentinois,
            <br/>and Sir Evan of Foix another, and the son of th6 Lord Nantouillet had
            <br/>on the fifth, and the squire himself had on the sixth, and when they were
            <br/>thus arrayed in these said coats, and sewed fast in them, they seemed like
            <br/>wild savages full of hair from the top of the head to the sole of the foot. This
            <br/>device pleased well the French king, who was well content with the Squire
            <br/>for it. They were apparelled in these coats secretly in a chamber that no man
            <br/>knew thereof but such as helped them. When Sir Evan of Foix had well ad-
            <br/>vised those coats, he said to the king, “Sire, command straitly that no man
            <br/>approach near us with any torches or fire, for if the fire fasten on any of
            <br/>these coats, we shall all be burnt without remedy.” The king answered and
            <br/>said, “Evan, you speak well and wisely: it shall be done as you have de-
            <br/>vised,” and incontinent sent for an Usher of his chamber, commanding him
            <br/>to go into the chamber where the ladies danced, and to command all the
            <br/>varlets holding torches to stand up by the walls, and none of them to ap-
            <br/>proach near to the savages that should come thither to dance. The usher end
            <br/>the king’s commandment, which was fulfilled. Soon after the Duke of Or-
            <br/>leans entered into the hall, accompanied with four knights and six torches,
            <br/>and knew nothing of the king’s commandment for the torches, nor of the
            <br/>mummery that was coming thither, but thought to behold the dancing, and
            <br/>began himself to dance. Therewith the king with the five other came in;
            <br/>they were so disguised in flax that no man knew them; five of them were
            <br/>fastened one to another: the king was loose, and went before, and led the
            <br/>device.</p>
            <p>“When they entered the hall every man took so great heed to them that
              <br/>they forgot their torches. The king departed from his company, and went
              <br/>with the ladies to sport with them, as youth required, and so passed by the
              <br/>queen and came to the Duchess of Berry, who took and held him by the arm
              <br/>to know what he was; but the king would not show his name. Then the
              <br/>duchess said, “ You shall not escape me till I know your name.” In the mean
              <br/>season great mischief fell on the other, and by reason of the Duke of Orleans;
              <br/>howbeit it was by ignorance, and against his will, for if he had considered
              <br/>before the mischief that fell, he would not have done as he did for all the
              <br/>gold in the world: but he was so desirous to know what personages the five
              <br/>were who danced, he put one of the torches that his servant held so near,
              <br/>that the heat of the fire entered into the flax (wherein if fire take there is no
              <br/>remedy) and suddenly was on a bright flame, and so each of them set fire on
              <br/>one another; the pitch was so fastened to the linen cloth, and their shirts so
              <br/>dry and fine, and so joining to their flesh, that they began to bum and to cry
              <br/>tor help. None durst come near them. They that did, burnt their hands, by
              <br/>reason of the heat of the pitch. One of them, called Nantouillet, advised him
              <br/>that the buttery was thereby. He fled thither and cast himself into a vessel
              <br/>full of water, wherein they rinsed pots, which saved him, or else he had been
              <br/>dead as the others were. Yet he was sore burnt with the fire. When the
              <br/>queen heard the cry that they made, she doubted of the king, for she knew
              <br/>well that he should be one of the six: wherewith she fell in a swoon, and
              <br/>knights and ladies came and comforted her. A piteous noise there was in the
              <br/>hall. The Duchess of Berry delivered the king from peril, for she did cast over
              <br/>him the train of her gown, and covered him from the fire. The king would
              <br/>have gone from her. ‘ Whither will you go?’ quoth she, ‘ you see well how
              <br/>your company burns. What are ye?’ 'I am the king.’ quoth he. ‘Haste you,’
              <br/>quoth she, ‘ and get you into other apparel, that the queen may see you, for
              <br/>she is in great fear of you.' Therewith the king departed out of the hall, and
              <br/>in all haste changed his apparel, and came to the queen; and the Duchess of
              <br/>Berry had somewhat comforted her, and had shewed her how she should see
              <br/>the king shortly: therewith the king came to the queen; and as soon as she
              <br/>saw him, for joy she embraced him and fell in a swoon; then she was borne
              <br/>unto her chamber, and the king went with her. And the bastard of Foix, who
              <br/>was all on fire, cried out with a loud voice. ‘Save the king, save the
              <br/>king!' "</p>
