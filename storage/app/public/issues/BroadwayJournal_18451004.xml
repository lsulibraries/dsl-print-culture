            <br/>Peace of the hallowed day—how pure and deep!
<br/>On the green earth—in the blue boundless air,
<br/>How do all things invite the soul to prayer!
<br/>Her solemn Sabbath how doth Nature keep!
<br/>Doth silence reign, that hither down may float 
<br/>The full deep waves of Heaven’s own harmony—
<br/>That favored man, from earthly coil set free,
<br/>Listening in awe, may catch the angelic note? 
<br/>O dreamer! see to it—that nought within 
<br/>The faint, yet glorious diapason mar!
<br/>Crush thy heart’s whispers; fix thy gaze alar,
<br/>And turn thee from the Siren lure of sin!
<br/>It is a “still small voice” that speaks His will 
<br/>Before whom sank the ocean billows, and were still.
<br/>O weary heart! there is a rest for thee;
<br/>O truant heart! there is a blessed home—
<br/>An isle of gladness on life’s treacherous sea,
<br/>Where storms, that vex the waters, never come. 
<br/>Through groves perennial, streams that cannot die 
<br/>Bear blessing round that fair and fertile shore;
<br/>And shipwrecked ones, beneath that bending sky,
<br/>Dream of the terrors of the deep no more.
<br/>Winnowed by wings immortal that sweet isle;
<br/>Vocal its air with music from above;
<br/>There meets the exile aye a welcoming smile;
<br/>There ever speaks a summoning voice of love 
<br/>"Say to the heavy laden and distressed—
<br/>‘Come unto me, and I will give you rest.’ ”

         <div class="head">The Gift of Prophecy.</div>
         <p>Our life is hid. Shadows dark as the raven’s wing
<br/>shut us in.and shut us out from what is within—from 
<br/>the only substantial. We know not the meaning of sight 
<br/>We know not what we see when sight is given. When 
<br/>glimpses of the Divine that is within and all around us, 
<br/>come athwart our darkness, they seem so beautiful, so 
<br/>heavenly, that we say we are under the dominion of the 
<br/>marvellous, and we fear that reason is reeling from her throne.</p>
         <p>If there are no Prophets, or Seers, whence has come
<br/>the idea of such? The skeptic says from the Imagina-
<br/>tion, or in other words the image-making power. But 
<br/>whence comes the original of an image in the mind?</p>
         <p>Of the gift of Prophecy I will speak what I know.— 
<br/>The “reasonable” man will pass my statements unread,
<br/>or lie will smile pityingly at ray “hallucinations.”</p> 
         <p>From an early age I have had the gilt of Prophecy. 
<br/>Not at all times; not for all events. But at particular
<br/>seasons the foreshadow, or foreshine of the Future has
<br/>come so deeply or so brightly upon my soul, that I have 
<br/>been compelled to feel, if not to utter the Prophecy. But
<br/>apart from these seasons I could never divine for myself, 
<br/>or another. That is, in what is called my natural state,
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>I could not do this. Of the influence of Mesmerism I 
<br/>shall speak hereafter. The first distinct shadowing of 
<br/>unknown events upon my consciousness that I remember, 
<br/>was when I was very young. From infancy I had been 
<br/>baptized in tears, and it is no strange thing that my first 
<br/>experience as a Seer should be sorrowful. I had been 
<br/>from home some time, and was returning. Within a mile 
<br/>of my father’s house the shadow fell. I was certain that
<br/>evil had come to those I loved. I was particularly cer-
<br/>tain that the blow had fallen upon my mother. I could 
<br/>hardly support myself till I reached home, so intense and 
<br/>terrible was my agitation and distress at the certainty 
<br/>that had come to me. My sister met me at the door, 
<br/>with an expression of suffering on her countenance that 
<br/>told a sad tale. She put her finger to her lip, closed the 
<br/>door softly, and drew me aside to say in a whisper, that 
<br/>our mother’s life was despaired of. It was what I ex-
<br/>pected, but I do not know that I was any better prepared
<br/>for the event. However, as yet I was but a novice in 
<br/>“Second Sight.” It is sometimes said that we should be 
<br/>miserable if we knew the future, and that this is the rea-
<br/>son why it is shut out from us. I suppose this is true 
<br/>of our ordinary state, but our whole being is changed 
<br/>when the prophetic sense is fully awakened, and we are 
<br/>not always, or often wretched in view of the trials of the 
<br/>future, but girded to meet them.</p>
         <p>Once in my life a great trial was hid from me, and 
<br/>revealed to a brother seer. My heart did not respond in 
<br/>faith to his vision. I smiled when he detailed with mi-
<br/>nuteness, great sorrows that were coming to me. My 
<br/>heart was a little faint when I thought it might be that 
<br/>he spoke truly. He told me of blessings that should be
<br/>mine, through the medium of these trials. When all the sorrow came,
<br/>I knew that he had thus far told me truly, 
<br/>yet I did not believe in the blessing he had predicted.— 
<br/>What a bundle of enigmas is man! But the blessing 
<br/>came as truly as the sorrow had come.</p>
         <p>Once when I had been very ill and was recovering, my 
<br/>Prophetic Light was clear, and comparatively far-reach-
<br/>ing. I saw, as it were, a scroll, written in light, with 
<br/>the deeds of years engraven on it. What no one had 
<br/>done, I saw with mid-day clearness that I should do. I 
<br/>saw that I should dare much, and accomplish much— 
<br/>that curses and blessings should be mine. With a heav-
<br/>enly awe, and a peace not of earth, for hours I read the 
<br/>scroll of Destiny. Whatever I sought to know, appear-
<br/>ed emblazoned in living light before me. At that mo-
<br/>ment, weak and faint from what all had deemed the bed 
<br/>of Death, I seemed to have superhuman strength to do 
<br/>all that waited my doing. Years of the most intense ac-
<br/>tivity, deeds that have awakened men from the death-
<br/>sleep of centuries, were crowded on that life-scroll. For 
<br/>hours I gazed without tiring, and then gradually all fa-
<br/>ded from before me, and I was left alone, with the weak-
<br/>ness of an infant, counting my heart-throbs, to see if I 
<br/>had forgotten how to count. I slowly gained health, and
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page188"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>forgot the vision—and not until the days of its accom-
<br/>plishment had passed, did I again call it to mind. Peo-
<br/>ple try at this day to explain all this neurologically, or 
<br/>mesmerically, but their explanations need explaining as 
<br/>much as my phenomena. I know that I am, that my 
<br/>gift is. Do they know more? Again and again since 
<br/>that Record of Destiny was unrolled to me, I have seen 
<br/>the Future. Many times my sight has been opened 
<br/>through Mesmerism, but then I seem to see with less of 
<br/>Beauty and of Life. On one occasion I was mesmerized, 
<br/>and the events of the coming year passed in rapid suc-
<br/>cession before me. I wrote them, that I might have the 
<br/>record when the vision had faded from my sight. I fold-
<br/>ed the Prophecy into my common-place-book, and weeks 
<br/>afterward I read it. I felt solemn in view of what I had 
<br/>seen, but calm and resigned. Only one event seemed to 
<br/>call for resignation, and that was to shut me from the 
<br/>world yet a little longer, perhaps till I have passed away. 
<br/>What boots it whether the world knows its benefactors? 
<br/>What boots it whether I steal into hearts an inspiration 
<br/>silent as the gentle and refreshing dew, or whether I 
<br/>come like the hoarse thunder which purifies the atmos-
<br/>phere ’mid terror and admiration? So that the heavenly 
<br/>cycles roll on, and God’s work is done, I am content. I 
<br/>have often had the Prophetic sense awakened for my-
<br/>self and others by the hand of the mesmerizer, and I 
<br/>have then seen strange and wonderful things, in this
<br/>world, and in the real world, where all is substance, 
<br/>not shadow. But men are not prepared for the wonders 
<br/>of this world—what then would they say to the events of 
<br/>the spiritual world? The God-Man of Nazareth said, “I 
<br/>have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear 
<br/>them now."</p>
         <p>The mesmeric state does not seem to be fully mine. In 
<br/>that I seem to be away from home. What is called the 
<br/>natural or spontaneous mesmeric state, in which I see 
<br/>the abstract, the distant, the future, in a word the spir-
<br/>itual, as my own Soul, this is the state I love. This is 
<br/>the foreshine of that world that we are all entering
<br/>upon.</p>

         <p>“La musique," says Marmontel, in those “Contes Mo-
<br/>raux”<span class="anchor" id="a001">
               <a href="#n001"/>
            </span> which, in all our translations, we have insisted 
<br/>upon calling “Moral Tales” as if in mockery of their 
<br/>spirit—“la musique est le seul des talens qui jouissent de 
<br/>lui méme; tous les autres veutent des temoins." He here 
<br/>confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with 
<br/>the capacity for creating them. No more than any other 
<br/>talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoy-
<br/>ment, where there is no second party to appreciate its ex-
<br/>ercise. And it is only in common with other talents that 
<br/>it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in soli-
<br/>tude. The idea which the raconteur has either failed 
<br/>to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to 
<br/>his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable 
<br/>one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly 
<br/>estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposi-
<br/>tion, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who 
<br/>love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. 
<br/>But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen 
<br/>mortality—and perhaps only one—which owes even more 
<br/>than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. 
<br/>I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of 
<br/>natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold a-
<br/>right the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold 
<br/>that glory. To me, at least, the presence—not of human 
<br/>life only—but of life in any other form than that of the 
<br/>green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless 
<br/>—is a stain upon the landscape—is at war with the ge-
<br/>nius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark val-
<br/>leys, and the grey rocks, and the waters that silently 
<br/>smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and 
<br/>the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all— 
<br/>I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal 
<br/>members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page189"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most per-
<br/>fect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among as-
<br/>sociate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon; 
<br/>whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eterni-
<br/>ty; whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is 
<br/>knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity; 
<br/>whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cog-
<br/>nizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a be-
<br/>ing which we, in consequence, regard as purely inani-
<br/>mate and material, much in the same manner as these 
<br/>animalculae must thus regard us.</p>
         <p>Our telescopes, and our mathematical investigations 
<br/>assure us on every hand—notwithstanding the cant of 
<br/>the more ignorant of the priesthood—that space, and 
<br/>therefore that hulk, is an important consideration in the 
<br/>eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars 
<br/>move are those best adapted for the evolution, without 
<br/>collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The 
<br/>forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a 
<br/>given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of 
<br/>matter;—while the surfaces themselves are so disposed 
<br/>as to accommodate a denser population than could be ac-
<br/>commodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. 
<br/>Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with
<br/>God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be an 
<br/>infinity of matter to fill it. And since we see clearly 
<br/>that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle 
<br/>—indeed as far as our judgments extend, the leading 
<br/>principle in the operations of Deity—it is scarcely logi-
<br/>cal to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, 
<br/>where we daily trace it, and not extending to those 
<br/>of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without 
<br/>end—yet all revolving around one far-distant centre
<br/>which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose,
<br/>in the same manner, life within life, the less within the 
<br/>greater, and all within the Spirit Divine ? In short, we
<br/>are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man,
<br/>in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more
<br/>moment in the universe than that vast “clod of the val-
<br/>ley” which he tills and contemns, and to which he de-
<br/>nies a soul for no more profound reason than that he
<br/>does not behold it in operation.<span class="anchor" id="a002">

         <p>These fancies, and such as these, have always given to 
<br/>my meditations among the mountains, and the forests, by
<br/>the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what the every-day
<br/>world would not fail to term the fantastic. My wander-
<br/>ings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching,
<br/>and often solitary; and the interest with which I have
<br/>strayed through many a dim deep valley, or gazed into
<br/>the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an
<br/>interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have
<br/>strayed and gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was
<br/>it who said, in allusion to the well-known work of Zim-
<br/>merman, that, “la solitude est une belle chose; mais il
<br/>faut quelqu 'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle
<br/>chose?” The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the ne-
<br/>cessity is a thing that does not exist.</p>
         <p>It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far
<br/>-distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and
<br/>sad rivers and melancholy tarns writhing or sleeping
<br/>within all—that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and
<br/>island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June,
<br/>and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of
<br/>an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I con-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>templated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look
<br/>upon it—such was the character of phantasm which it 
<br/>wore.</p>
         <p>On all sides—save to the west, where the sun was
<br/>about sinking—arose the verdant walls of the forest.
<br/>The little river which turned sharply in its course, and
<br/>was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
<br/>exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green
<br/>foliage of the trees to the east—while in the opposite
<br/>quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and
<br/>glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and con-
<br/>tinuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson water-
<br/>fall from the sunset fountains of the sky.</p>
         <p>About mid-wav in the short vista which my dreamy 
<br/>vision took in, one small circular island, profusely ver
<br/>-dured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.</p>
         <p>So blended bank and shadow there,
<br/>That each seemed pendulous in air—</p>
         <p>so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely
<br/>possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emer-
<br/>ald turf its crystal dominion began.</p>
         <p>My position enabled me to include in a single view
<br/>both the eastern and western extremities of the islet; and
<br/>I observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects.
<br/>The latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties.
<br/>It glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sun-
<br/>light, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was
<br/>short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed.
<br/>The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect—bright, slender and
<br/>graceful—of eastern figure and foliage, with bark smooth,
<br/>-glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a deep sense of
<br/>life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from
<br/>out the Heavens, yet every thing had motion through the
<br/>gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies,
<br/>that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.<span class="anchor" id="a003">
               <a href="#n003"/>
            </span>
         </p>
         <p>The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in
<br/>the blackest shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peace-
<br/>ful gloom here pervaded all things. The trees were
<br/>dark in color and mournful in form and attitude—wreath
<br/>-ing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes,
<br/>that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.
<br/>The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the
<br/>heads of its blades hung droopingly, and, hither and thi-
<br/>ther among it, were many small unsightly hillocks, low,
<br/>and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of
<br/>graves, but were not; although over and all about them
<br/>the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the
<br/>trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury
<br/>itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
<br/>with darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun
<br/>descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from
<br/>the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed
<br/>by the stream; while other shadows issued momently
<br/>from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
<br/>entombed.</p>
         <p>This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly
<br/>excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in reverie. “If 
<br/>ever island were enchanted,”—said I to myself—“this is 
<br/>it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who remain
<br/>from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs
<br/>theirs?—or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind
<br/>yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste
<br/>away mournfully; rendering unto God little by little
<br/>their existence, as these trees render up shadow after
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page190"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>shadow, exhausting their substances unto dissolution?
<br/>What the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its
<br/>shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys upon, may
<br/>not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?</p>
         <p>As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun
<br/>sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered
<br/>round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom
<br/>large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the sycamore 
<br/>—flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the
<br/>water, a quick imagination might have converted into
<br/>anything it pleased—while I thus mused, it appeared to
<br/>me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I
<br/>had been pondering, made its way slowly into the dark-
<br/>ness from out the light at the western end of the island.
<br/>She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged
<br/>it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within the 
<br/>influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed
<br/>indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as she passed
<br/>within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at
<br/>length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. 
<br/>“The revolution which has just been made by the Fay,” 
<br/>continued I musingly—“is the cycle of the brief year of 
<br/>her life. She has floated through her winter and through
<br/>her summer. She is a year nearer unto Death: for I did
<br/>not fail to see that as she came into the shade, her sha-
<br/>dow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark 
<br/>water, making its blackness more black.”</p>
         <p>And again the boat appeared, and the Fay; but about
<br/>the attitude of the latter there was more of care and un-
<br/>certainty, and less of elastic joy. She floated again from 
<br/>out the light, and into the gloom (which deepened mo-
<br/>mently) and again her shadow fell from her into the
<br/>ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness. 
<br/>And again and again she made the circuit of the island,
<br/>(while the sun rushed down to his slumbers) and at
<br/>each issuing into the light, there was more sorrow about
<br/>her person, while it grew feebler, and far fainter, and 
<br/>more indistinct; and at each passage into the gloom,
<br/>there fell from her a darker shade, which became
<br/>whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when
<br/>the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere 
<br/>ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her
<br/>boat into the region of the ebony flood—and that she issued
<br/>thence at all I cannot say,—for darkness fell over all
<br/>things, and I beheld her magical figure no more.</p>

<br/>The Wigwam and the Cabin. By William Gilmore
<br/>Simms.</p>
         <p>This is one of the most interesting numbers of the Li-
<br/>brary yet published—and decidedly the most American 
<br/>of the American books. “The Wigwam and the Cabin” 
<br/>is merely a general or generic title;—the volume is a 
<br/>collection of tales most of which were written for the 
<br/>Annuals, and thus have failed in circulating among the 
<br/>masses of the people. We are truly glad to see them in a 
<br/>compact form.</p>
         <p>In a recent number of our Journal we spoke of Mr. 
<br/>Simms as “the best novelist which this country has,
<br/>upon the whole, produced;” and this is our deliberate 
<br/>opinion. We take into consideration, of course, as well
<br/>the amount of what he has written, as the talent he has 
<br/>displayed;—he is the Lopez de Vega of American wri-
<br/>ters of fiction. His merits lie among the major and his 
<br/>defects among the minor morals of literature. His ear-
<br/>lier works of length, such as “The Partisan,” were dis-
<br/>figured by many inaccuracies of style, and especially by 
<br/>the prevalence of the merely repulsive, where the horri-
<br/>ble was the object—but in invention, in vigor, in move-
<br/>ment, in the power of exciting interest, and in the artis-
<br/>tical management of his themes, he has surpassed, we 
<br/>think, any of his countrymen:—that is to say, he has 
<br/>surpassed any of them in the aggregate of these high 
<br/>qualities. His best fictions, in our opinion, are “Martin 
<br/>Faber” (one of his first tales, if not his very first published 
<br/>one); “Beauchampe";“Richard Hurdis”;“Castle Dis-
<br/>mal”;“Helen Halsey”; and “Murder will Out.” “Mar-
<br/>tin Faber” has been said to resemble “Miserrimus”— 
<br/>and in fact we perceive that the individual minds which
<br/>originated the two stories have much in them of similarity 
<br/>—but as regards the narratives themselves, or even their
<br/>tone, there is no resemblance whatever. “Martin Faber” 
<br/>is the better work of the two. “Beauchampe” is in-
<br/>tensely interesting; but the historical truth has somewhat 
<br/>hampered and repressed the natural strength of the ar-
<br/>tist. “Richard Hurdis” is the perfection of rough vigor
<br/>in conception and conduct—a very powerful book. “Cas- 
<br/>tle Dismal” is one of the most original fictions ever
<br/>penned and deserves all that order of commendation 
<br/>which the critics lavished upon Walpole’s Castle of 
<br/>Otranto. No man of imagination-can read this story
<br/>without admitting instantly the genius of its author;—
<br/> still the narrative has important defects. “Helen Hal-
<br/>sey” is more “correct” (in the French sense of the word) 
<br/>but less meritorious upon the whole. We believe it is a 
<br/>favorite with its author; and the public have received it 
<br/>with marked approbation. “Murder Will Out” is the 
<br/>first and the most meritorious of the series now lying be-
<br/>fore us. We have no hesitation in calling it the best 
<br/>ghost-story we ever read. It is full of the richest and 
<br/>most vigorous imagination—is forcibly conceived—and
<br/>detailed throughout with a degree of artistic skill which 
<br/>has had no parallel among American story-tellers since 
<br/>the epoch of Brockden Brown.</p>
         <p>The other tales of the volume are all excellent in their 
<br/>various ways. Their titles are “The Two Camps, a Le-
<br/>gend of the Old North State”; “The Last Wager, or
<br/>the Gamester of the Mississippi";“The Arm-Chair of
<br/>Tustenugge, a Tradition of the Catawba”;"The Snake
<br/>of the Cabin";“Oakatibbe, or the Choctaw Sampson";

            <br/>and "Jocassee, a Cherokee Legend.” The author says
<br/>of them, in an advertisement—“The material employed 
<br/>will be found to illustrate, in large degree, the border,
<br/>history of the South. I can speak with confidence of the
<br/>general truthfulness of its treatment. The life of the 
<br/>planter, the squatter, the Indian and the negro—the bold
<br/>and hardy pioneer and the vigorous yeomen—these are 
<br/>the subjects. In their delineation I have mostly drawn
<br/>from living portraits, and, in frequent instances, from
<br/>actual scenes and circumstances within the memories of 
<br/>men.”</p>
         <p>Mr. Simms has exercised a very remarkable influence
<br/>upon the literature of his country—more especially upon
<br/>that of its Southern regions—nor do we regard this in-
<br/>fluence as in any degree the less important because a Mr.
<br/>William A. Jones "regards slightingly the mass of his
<br/>romantic and poetical efforts.” We shall speak again
<br/>of “The Cabin and The Wigwam,” and in the meantime
<br/>we quote a passage from “Murder Will Out.” Our 
<br/>readers must bear in mind, however, the absolute impos-
<br/>sibility of conveying, by extract, any just conception of a 
<br/>story whose main element is its skilful adaptation of 
<br/>parts:</p>
         <p>“It’s very strange!" soliloquized the youth, as he wandered
<br/>along the edges of the dense bay or swamp-bottom, which we 
<br/>have passingly referred to,—“it’s very strange what troubles me
<br/>so! I feel almost frightened, and yet I know I’m not to be fright-
<br/>ened easily, and I don’t see anything in the woods to frighten me.
<br/>It’s strange the major didn’t come along this road! Maybe he
<br/>took another higher up that leads by a different settlement. I
<br/>wish I had asked the man at the house if there’s such another 
<br/>road. I reckon there must be, however, for where could the ma-
<br/>jor have gone?”</p>
         <p>The unphilosophical mind of James Grayling did not, in his 
<br/>farther meditations, carry him much beyond this starting point; 
<br/>and with its continual recurrence in soliloquy, he proceeded to
<br/>traverse the margin of the bay, until he came to its junction with,
<br/>and termination at, the high-road. The youth turned into this,
<br/>and, involuntarily departing from it a moment after, soon found
<br/>himself on the opposite side of the bay thicket. He wandered on
<br/>and on, as he himself described it, without any power to restrain
<br/>himself. He knew not how far lie went; but instead of main-
<br/>taining his watch for two hours only, he was gone more than four;
<br/>and, at length, a sense of weariness which overpowered him all
<br/>of a sudden, caused him to seat himself at the loot of a tree, and
<br/>snatch a few moments of rest. He denied that he slept in this
<br/>time. He insisted to the last moment of his life that sleep never
<br/>visited his eyelids that night,—that he was conscious of fatigue
<br/>and exhaustion, but not drowsiness—and that this fatigue was so
<br/>numbing as to be painful, and effectually kept him from any sleep.
<br/>While he sat thus beneath the tree, with a body weak and nerve-
<br/>less, but a mind excited, he knew not how or why, to the most 
<br/>acute degree of expectation and attention, he heard his name
<br/>called by the well-known voice of his friend, Major Spencer.
<br/>The voice called him three times,—“James Grayling!—James! 
<br/>—James Grayling!" before he could muster strength enough to
<br/>answer. It was not courage he wanted,—of that he was positive,
<br/>for he felt sure, as he said, that something had gone wrong, and
<br/>he was never more ready to fight in his life than at that moment
<br/>could he have commanded the physical capacity; but his throat
<br/>seemed dry to suffocation,—his lips effectually sealed up as if
<br/>with wax, and when he did answer, the sounds seemed as fine
<br/>and soft as whisper of some child just born.</p>
         <p>“Oh! major, is it you?’’</p>
         <p>Such he thinks, were the very words he made use of in reply;
<br/>and the answer that be received was instantaneous, though the
<br/>voice came from some little distance in the bay, and his own
<br/>voice did not hear. He only knows what he meant to say.
<br/>The answer was to this effect.</p>
         <p>It is, James!—It is your own friend, Lionel Spencer, that
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>speaks to you; do not be alarmed when you see me! I have
<br/>been shockingly murdered!’’</p>
         <p>James asserts that he tried to tell him that he would not be 
<br/>frightened, but his own voice was still a whisper, which he him-
<br/>self could scarcely hear. A moment after he had spoken, he
<br/>heard something like a sudden breeze that rustled through the
<br/>bay bushes at his feet, and his eyes were closed without his effort,
<br/>and indeed in spite of himself. When he opened them, he saw 
<br/>Major Spencer standing at the edge of the bay, about twenty
<br/>steps from him. Though he stood in the shade of a thicket, and 
<br/>there was no light in the heavens save that of the stars, he was
<br/>yet enabled to distinguish perfectly, and with great ease, every 
<br/>lineament of his friend’s face.</p>
         <p>He looked very pale, and his garments were covered with
<br/>blood; and James said that he strove very much to rise from the
<br/>place were he sat and approach him;—"for in truth,” said the
<br/>lad, “so far from feeling any fear, I felt nothing but fury in my
<br/>heart; but I could not move a limb. My feet were fastened to
<br/>the ground; my hands to my sides; and I could only bend for-
<br/>ward and gasp. I felt as if I should have died with vexation that
<br/>I could not rise; but a power which I could not resist, made
<br/>me motionless and almost speechless. I could only say, ‘ Mur-
<br/>dered!’—and that one word I believe I must have repeated a 
<br/>dozen times.”</p>
         <p>“Yes, murdered!—murdered by the Scotchman who slept
<br/>with us at your fire the night before last. James, I look to you
<br/>to have the murderer brought to justice! James!—do you
<br/>hear me, James?"</p>
         <p>“These,” said James, “I think were the very words, or near
<br/>about the very words, that I heard; and I tried to ask the major
<br/>to tell me how it was, and how I could do what he required; but I
<br/>didn’t hear myself speak, though it would appear that he did, for
<br/>almost immediately after I had tried to speak what I wished to
<br/>say, he answered me just as if I had said it. He told me that
<br/>the Scotchman had waylaid, killed, and hidden him in that very
<br/>bay; that his murderer had gone to Charleston; and that if I
<br/>made haste to town, I would find him in the Falmouth packet,
<br/>which was then lying in the harbour and ready to sail for Eng-
<br/>land. He farther said that everything depended upon my making
<br/>haste,—that I mast reach town by to-morrow night if I wanted to
<br/>be in season, and go right on board the vessel and charge the
<br/>criminal with the deed. ‘Do not be afraid,’ said he, when he
<br/>had finished; ’be afraid of nothing, James, for God will help and
<br/>strengthen you to the end.’ When I heard all I burst into a flood
<br/>of tears, and then I fell strong. I felt that I could talk, or fight,
<br/>or do almost anything; and I jumped up to my feet, and was just
<br/>about to run down to where the major stood, but with the first 
<br/>step which I made forward, he was gone. I stopped and looked
<br/>all around me, but I could see nothing; and the bay was just as 
<br/>black as midnight. But I went down to it and tried to press in 
<br/>where I thought the major had been standing; but I couldn’t get
<br/>far, the brush and bay bushes were so close and thick. I was
<br/>now bold and strong enough, and I called out, loud enough to be
<br/>heard half a mile. I didn’t exactly know what I called for, or
<br/>what I wanted to learn, or I have forgotten. But I heard nothing
<br/>more.</p>

<br/>Bubbles from the Brunnen of Nassau. By An Old
<br/>Man.</p>
         <p>The Old Man is Sir Francis Head. His bubbles have a
<br/>sparkle about them which has insured and must insure
<br/>their popularity. Few books have met with more cor-
<br/>dial reception. The author’s preface happily conveys the
<br/>manner of the book:</p>
         <p>The writer of this trifling Volume was suddenly sentenced, in
<br/>the cold evening of his life, to drink the mineral waters of one of
<br/>the bubbling springs, or brunnen, of Nassau. In his own opinion,
<br/>his constitution was not worth so troublesome a repair; but being
<br/>outvoted, he bowed and departed.</p>
         <p>On reaching die point of his destination, he found not only wa-
<br/>ter-bibbing—bathing—and ambulation to be the order of the day,
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page192"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>but it was moreover insisted upon, that the mind was to be relaxed
<br/>inversely as the body was to be strengthened. Daring this severe
<br/>regimen, he was driven to amuse himself in his old age by blow-
<br/>ing as he tottled about, a few literary Bubbles. His hasty sketches
<br/>of whatever chanced for the moment to please either his eye, or
<br/>his mind, were only made—because he had nothing else in the world
<br/>to do; and he now offers them to that vast and highly respectable
<br/>class of people who read from exactly the self-same motive.</p>
         <p>The critic must, of course, declare this production to be vain
<br/>empty—light—hollow—superficial .... but it is the nature of
<br/>Bubbles to be so.</p>

         <p>Lady Mary; or Not of the World. By the Rev. Chas.
<br/>B. Tayler, M. A., Author of “The Records of a Good
<br/>Man's Life," etc. New-York: Stanford if Swords,
<br/>139 Broadway.</p>
         <p>Since our last number, in which we announced the is-
<br/>sue of this beautiful little work, we have read it through
<br/>with deep interest. It is admirably written and well
<br/>adapted to its end—the rebuke of vice and folly among the
<br/>more cultivated classes of society. We have seldom, if
<br/>ever, seen a more appropriate gift-book, especially for the 
<br/>young.</p>
         <p>Sermons on Certain of the Less Prominent Facts and
<br/>References in Sacred Story. By Henry Melvill, D. 
<br/>D., Principal of the East India College, and Chaplain

<br/>Stanford &amp; Swords.</p>
         <p>These are very peculiar, and for this reason, as well as
<br/>for others, very interesting discourses. We give the titles
<br/>of the several sermons, as the best way of conveying, in 
<br/>brief, the character of the book:—“The Young Man in
<br/>the Linen Cloth;" “The Fire on the Shore;" “The Find-
<br/>ing the Guest-Chamber “The Spectre’s Sermon, a Tru-
<br/>ism;" “Various Opinions (about Christ);” “The Mis-
<br/>representations of Eve;” “Seeking after Finding;" “The 
<br/>Bird’s Nest "Angels our Guardians in Trifles	“The
<br/>Appearance of Failure;" “Simon, the Cyrenian;" “The
<br/>Power of the Eye;" “Pilate’s Wife;"and“The Exami-
<br/>nation of Cain.” These sermons are brief. The volume
<br/>consists of only 130 pages octavo.</p>
         <p>A Latin Grammar, Comprising all the Rules and Observa-
<br/>tions necessary to an Accurate Knowledge of the Latin 
<br/>Classics. By James Ross, LL. D. WITH Latin Idioms 
<br/>and a New Prosody, and other Important Additions and 
<br/>Emendations, by N. C. Brooks, A. M., Professor of the 
<br/>Latin and Greek Languages, and Principal of the Latin
<br/>High School, Baltimore. Philadelphia: Thos. Cowp-
<br/>perthwait &amp; Co.</p>
         <p>This is a judicious attempt on the part of Mr. Brooks
<br/>(no less distinguished as an imaginative and graceful po-
<br/>et than by his classical acquirements) to restore the La-
<br/>tin Grammar of Dr. Ross to the position it once held in
<br/>our Academies and Colleges. There can be no doubt
<br/>that the book, in its original form, had many demerits,
<br/>but we believe that these were far more than counter-
<br/>balanced by merits not elsewhere to be found.</p>
         <p>Mr. Brooks, in his edition, has omitted, as superfluous,
<br/>the author's Remarks on English Articles, Nouns and
<br/>Pronouns. In Orthography he has given the division of
<br/>the letters, with more particular rules for their pronun-
<br/>ciation. In Etymology he has made many new arrange-
<br/>ments—placing, for example, under the head of “Gen-
<br/>der,” its rules and exceptions:—these in the original
<br/>work were interspersed at random, throughout. In 
<br/>Verbs, too, there are several important alterations and ad-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>ditions—deleo is conjugated in place of doceo; the latter, 
<br/>not being accurately regular. Mr. Brooks gives, also,
<br/>(what is essential) an explanatian of the nature of the
<br/>Gerund and Supine. In Syntax the rules are much sim-
<br/>plified and abridged, and some Remarks on Latin Idioms.
<br/>Syntatical Arrangement and Analysis are, with great
<br/>judgment, introduced. The Prosody of Ross is entirely
<br/>remodelled, and for this portion of his labor, Mr. Brooks
<br/>is entitled to very especial credit. His work, upon the 
<br/>whole, is one of high value, and we are happy to hear of
<br/>its general introduction into schools.</p>
         <p>We must do Mr. Brooks the justice of appending to this
<br/>very imperfect notice, the opinion of a scholar whose
<br/>good word is of weight; the letter annexed will speak
<br/>for itself:</p>
         <p>Baltimore, September 13, 1845.</p> 
         <p>Dear Sir—Having carefully examined Ross’ Latin Grammar,
<br/>as revised and amended by you, I find the book every way equal, if
<br/>not superior to any that art used in our schools. After a thorough 
<br/>perusal of your “Latin Lessons,” I take pleasure in acknowledg-
<br/>ing that never, even in my “fatherland,” have I read a book bet-
<br/>ter calculated to facilitate the study of the Latin language. It
<br/>should be in the hands of every beginner. Moreover, the many
<br/>sentences it contains embracing facts in the history of my adopted
<br/>country, must make it interesting not only to the student, but dear
<br/>to every patriotic heart. Yours respectfully,</p>

<br/>“Margaret of Valois.” “North’s Specimens of the Brit-
<br/>ish Critics” is continued in a paper replete with coarse
<br/>malignity, and the customary Wilsonic rant.</p>

<br/>Foreigner’s First Glimpses of Georgia"—No. 7 of "The 
<br/>Marion Family," and some remarkably tine poems. We
<br/>allude especially to “The Maiden’s First Dream of Love" 
<br/>and “Elodie, a Ballad." These are anonymous, and we
<br/>attribute them to the same hand. We quote the first
<br/>stanza of the one first named.</p>

<br/>of “The Battle of Concord Bridge” from a painting by
<br/>Frankenstein—also a clean-looking plate by Ellis, illus-
<br/>trating the Scriptural words, “Behold the place where
<br/>they laid him.” The customary fashion-plate is very
<br/>well done. The contributions of “The Lady’s Book”
<br/>have been steadily rising in merit for the last year, and are
<br/>now, generally, better than those of any Magazine of its
<br/>class. They seem to be carefully written—less depend-
<br/>ence being placed upon the mere name of the author, and
<br/>more upon the intrinsic merit of his composition. The 
<br/>best article in the present number is “The Duchess of
<br/>Bavaria,” a story of the highest romantic interest, beau-
<br/>tifully told by Mrs. E. F. Ellet. Mrs. Hale, Miss Leslie,
<br/>Mrs Hentz, Mrs. Adams, Miss Rand, Mrs. Lee, Tucker-
<br/>man, Frost, Sullivan and others have, also, very excellent
<br/>contributions. Mr. Godey, we learn, is making unusual
<br/>exertions for next year’s campaign. His Magazine has
<br/>about it a “keeping,” a consistency, which is one of the
<br/>surest indications of long and prosperous life. We miss
<br/>one or two of his old contributors. What has become of
<br/>Mrs. Osgood? Her papers were wont to be the charm of
<br/>the “Book.”</p>
         <p>Graham's Magazine for October, has a portrait and bi-
<br/>ography of Robert Morris, the gentlemanly editor of the
<br/>Philadelphia “Inquirer.” This is the best likeness of the 
<br/>series. There is also a spirited engraving of a Maunitar-
<br/>ri Warrior. Grund contributes an interesting paper on 
<br/>“The Continental Historians”; Alfred B Street has “A 
<br/>Day’s Fishing in the Kalikoon”—very picturesque; and
<br/>Mrs. Osgood furnishes “Leonora L’Estrange,” one of her
<br/>invariably graceful compositions. We purloin from it an

         <p>The Aristidean for September looks and speaks re-
<br/>markably well. Its papers are all pointed and forcible.
<br/>“Travels in Texas” is one of the most interesting sketch-
<br/>es we have seen in a year, and puts us in mind of the vi-
<br/>gorous add imaginative “Jack Long" and the “San Sa-
<br/>ba Hills.” There is a scorching review of Hirst’s Po-
<br/>ems—a good thing for everybody but Mr. Hirst;—this is
<br/>a very laughable article. “Tourists in America’ is also
<br/>exceedingly pungent:—both these papers, we presume,
<br/>are from the pen editorial. We notice, also, as espe-
<br/>cially meritorious, “Popular Governments and Institu-
<br/>tions”; and “ Leaves from aLog-Book." The Notices 
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>of New Books are unusually full and particularly inde-
<br/>pendent. The poetry of the number is, nevertheless, its
<br/>chief feature. “Sir Albert De Veniter” is capital.</p>
         <p>Here is an excellent epigram:</p>

         <p>This treatise is prepared by a gentleman who has given
<br/>many year’s attention to the subject. It is not to be
<br/>classed with the Oracula and Napoleon-Books of fate, but
<br/>is a straight-forward analysis and exposition of the Sci-
<br/>ence of Astrology. The name of Lord Bacon, the last
<br/>great avowed adherent of the belief, casts a certain inter-
<br/>est on the subject even at this distant day.</p>

         <p>After many pompous announcements, and laudatory pa-
<br/>ragraphs, the collection of Paintings at Bordentown came
<br/>under the scattering fiat of Mr. Birch, the auctioneer of
<br/>Philadelphia; and as the distance was too great to ad-
<br/>mit our reaching the scene of action in sufficient time
<br/>on the 17th, the day of sale, to inspect the paintings pre-
<br/>vious to their being sold, we left New-York by the Phila-
<br/>delphia Railroad the day before, intending to devote eve-
<br/>ry moment after our arrival until nightfall, to the admi-
<br/>ration of the widely praised rarities of Art; but the se-
<br/>quel proved, that in this, as in other matters of greater
<br/>moment, our intentions may be our own, but their fulfil-
<br/>ment is beyond us, and that</p>
         <p>There is a Divinity doth shape our ends, rough hew them as we 
<br/>will;
<br/>for ere we had completed the second mile on the banks
<br/>of the canal beyond Princeton, by the gross, inexcusable
<br/>neglect of the engineer the train came to a stoppage, and
<br/>an express was despatched to the nearest station to bring 
<br/>up an auxiliary engine. During this detention, an empty
<br/>tow boat came down the canal, when, flattering them-
<br/>selves that the tortoise might beat the hare while he
<br/>slept, several of the railroad passengers, whose destiny
<br/>was not beyond the next station, hailed and embarked on
<br/>board the boat. It is true they proceeded on their jour- 
<br/>ney, but those only who have marked the weary pace of 
<br/>a toil-worn horse on a towing path, can judge how slow-
<br/>ly. The day was beautiful—the scenery of the varying 
<br/>landscape delightful—the air sweet and refreshing; but
<br/>time passed, and alas for poor frail humanity! it must be
<br/>fed; some of the passengers leaving home at an early
<br/>hour, had made but a sorry breakfast—and with a verti-
<br/>cal sun bearing strong upon them, Hunger became quite
<br/>irresistible. On hoard there was nought save water— 
<br/>therefore to alleviate their sufferings, one of the boatmen
<br/>was landed, with instructions to obtain anything in the
<br/>shape of refreshments. After some delay he returned 
<br/>th a basket of green apples, and therewith a loaf of
<br/>new bread, freely and kindly given by one of the hospi-
<br/>table Jersey farmers, whose house and grounds skirted
<br/>the canal. Our passengers quelled the rapacity-of their 
<br/>stomachs—affording a pretty illustration of our constitu-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>tional declaration that all men are equal.</p>
         <p>The frail and humble bark was honored with carrying
<br/>representatives of the Senate, the Bar, and the Mart, and
<br/>ey, forced into a momentary forgetfulness of the world-
<br/>ly dignities with which adventitious circumstance had
<br/>endowed them, were content with</p>
         <p>Wholesome thirst and appetite more grateful,
<br/>to partake of a primitive, temperate lunch of bread, fruit,
<br/>and water, on board of a coal barge. This little inci-
<br/>dent was scarcely past, when the spires of Trenton
<br/>churches broke on our view, and in a very short period
<br/>the locomotive came up with its long and burthensome
<br/>train of carriages. On reaching Bordentown, we has-
<br/>tened to the object of our journey. The day was fast
<br/>waning—the rays of the setting sun contrasting finely
<br/>with the coming shades of evening, in the beautiful dale
<br/>in which the house is situated, afforded some rich bits
<br/>for the sketch-book: and we ourselves involuntarily fell
<br/>under the influence of the moment and the place, for it
<br/>was with a feeling of deep sympathy we regarded the
<br/>willows and the blighted tree which, standing at the en-
<br/>tance from the road, are typical of the desolation and
<br/>fallen fortunes of the family whose meteor-like career
<br/>ce lit up and electrified Europe. Shaking off these
<br/>reflections on the past, we entered the mansion and were
<br/>much gratified by the inspection of the statuary and fa-
<br/>mily paintings—mementos of their temporary greatness—
<br/>now become heirlooms to a scion to whom they are trea-
<br/>sures sacred and beyond price, and of which no time or
<br/>circumstance ought to deprive him, unless influenced by
<br/>the passion which actuated his relative, the late Cardi-
<br/>nal, when, refusing the princely ofl'er which was made 
<br/>for his extensive collection of pictures, he exclaimed, “Je 
<br/>suis Francais; ma galerie appartient à la France; elle est
<br/>destinee à mon diocese, si j’ai le bonheurd’y rentrer”—he 
<br/>devotes them to enrich one of the national museums of
<br/>France. We particularly allude to an original painting
<br/>by David, representing Napoleon on his charger ascend-
<br/>ing the Alps. This picture, which is considered a chef
<br/>d’ceuvre, has been repeatedly engraved, and is too well 
<br/>known to need eulogium, hangs in the drawing-room on
<br/>the left, opposite which is a full length by the same ar-
<br/>tist, of Joseph in his state robes as King of Naples; and
<br/>over the mantel-piece, a full length of Napoleon as Em-
<br/>peror. The whole of these portraits are faithful resem-
<br/>blances, painted with much care; the coloring being se-
<br/>date, the expression true, and the details elaborated with
<br/>a degree of perfection not often seen. It is recorded in 
<br/>the life of this painter, that Napoleon’s admiration of 
<br/>his talents was so great that on entering his painting-
<br/>room the Conqueror of Austerlitz advanced two steps, and
<br/>taking off his hat, exclaimed, “Sir, I salute you.” On
<br/>a side table at the entrance of the same room, stands a 
<br/>bust by Canova, of Charles, Prince of Canino; and op-
<br/>posite thereto a bust of Zencid, daughter of Joseph, by
<br/>Bartolini. These were the parents of the present prince.
<br/>In the adjoining room was a bust of Marie Louise, and
<br/>in the dining-room the following busts, all by Canova:</p>
         <div class="ab">Madame, Mére de Napoleon.
<br/>Pauline, Sister of Napoleon.
<br/>Eliza, 	“
<br/>Charles. Pere de Napoleon.
<br/>Lucien,
<br/>Jerome.</div>
         <p>We know of no terms sufficiently warm to speak our 
<br/>admiration of these gems of art, for they possess a mi-
<br/>nute delicacy of expression, a softness of contour, and a 
<br/>truthfulness of the party represented, that we never re-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page195"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>collect to have seen equalled, and which impels us to
<br/>acknowledge that the artist capable of executing such
<br/>work, did not depend for success on the caprice or pride
<br/>of his employers, but by his taste and genius was confi-
<br/>dent of immortality. In the catalogue of the Statuary
<br/>for sale there were several busts by Bosig, but in which
<br/>we looked in vain for the hand of the great master. Lot
<br/>78, called Pauline, by Canova, was much chipped and 
<br/>discolored, and smaller in dimensions than the bust spoken
<br/>of in the dining-room. The other matters we shall speak
<br/>of hereafter.</p>
         <p>The collection of Paintings for sale did not realize
<br/>our expectations; for, from the opportunities possessed
<br/>by the late proprietor, and of which it is known he avail-
<br/>ed himself, we expectted to have found much more 
<br/>of originality and talent than were there, for if an excep-
<br/>tion is taken to some twenty pictures, the collection was
<br/>far below mediocrity—not one cabinet painting of even
<br/>ordinary pretensions being offered for sale; and this in
<br/>face of the fact that one picture, fourteen inches by six-
<br/>teen, on panel, by Correggio, representing Christ in the
<br/>Garden of Olives, was, when Joseph Bonaparte and 
<br/>Jourdain were routed at Vittoria, captured with his bag-
<br/>gage, his crown, and all the paraphernalia of his ephe-
<br/>meral monarchy, by Wellington, in whose possession the
<br/>gem now is, and which is estimated at the value of 3000
<br/>guineas. The remaining portion of the catalogue consist-
<br/>ed of bad copies of very doubtful originals, in a direful state
<br/>of dilapidation from neglect, damp, and repeated cleaning 
<br/>and restoration.</p>
         <p>As it is to be expected that many pictures will here-
<br/>after be in the market dignified with the reputation of 
<br/>coming from the Bonaparte collection, we give herewith
<br/>a list of the greater part of the collection, with the names
<br/>of the purchasers, and the prices given, which we con-
<br/>sider to have been extremely liberal: and we do not hes-
<br/>itate to assert that in London or Paris, the gross amount
<br/>of the sale—near $20,000—would not have been exceeded.
<br/>We admit that a few pictures might have brought higher
<br/>prices: but then, on the remainder, comprising the doubt-
<br/>ful and the injured, the prices would have been consid-
<br/>erably less, bringing the aggregate to about the same 
<br/>amount.</p>
         <p>While on the subject of painting, we cannot refrain
<br/>from alluding to the short-sighted policy of the Legisla-
<br/>ture in levying a duty of twenty per cent, on foreign
<br/>paintings, as being inimical to the best interests of art,
<br/>and preventing, in the infancy of painting in this coun-
<br/>try, the introduction of a picture of known merit, to aid
<br/>the studies of our young artists.</p>
         <p>The influence of the pencil has always been great, and
<br/>in perfect accordance with the advance of general intel-
<br/>ligence; for the sentiments which painting is capable of 
<br/>inspiring, are truly wonderful. Nor is it possible to over-
<br/>fate the merit of one who has the power of speaking to
<br/>all hearts through his silent but universal language;-
<br/>therefore it was without surprise we saw assembled at
<br/>the sale, amateurs and collectors from all parts of the
<br/>Union. Amongst the gentlemen whose penchant for the 
<br/>Fine Arts is well known, we noticed Col. Hunter (whose 
<br/>fine collection cannot be sufficiently praised), and Mr.
<br/>Grattan, H. B. M. Consul at Boston, when the latter, by
<br/>his able criticisms fully substantiated the report of his 
<br/>fine taste and judgment. It was to be expected that Mr.
<br/>Birch, the auctioneer, would have favored the company
<br/>with some remarks respecting the pictures; but with a 
<br/>propriety highly creditable, he refrained therefrom, leav-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>ing the genuineness of the collection, and its being with-
<br/>out exchange or addition, to be inferred.</p>
         <div class="ab">6. De Marne. Landscape—Arrival of a Diligence at the 
<br/>gates of the City. This was a pleasing subject, but its 
<br/>authenticity strongly questionable; the figures were wretch-
<br/>edly done—Mr. Robb,	$190</div>
         <div class="ab">8. S. Denys. Storm at Night—Barn on Fire.—The cattle 
<br/>exceedingly well drawn, and the whole of the composi-
<br/>tion spirited—Mr. Oldfield,	105</div>
         <div class="ab">12 &amp; 13. Vernet. The Falls of Tivoli, taken from two points
<br/>of view.—Two pleasing pictures of the school of Vernet, 
<br/>but possessing nothing to warrant the price given—Mr.
<br/>Robb,	220</div>
         <div class="ab">11. Rubens. Two Lions and a Fawn—canvass 7 ft. 8—4
<br/>ft. 7.—This picture painted with an infinite degree of merit 
<br/>—and from the price at which it was withdrawn highly
<br/>prized by the owner—is one of those specimens of talent
<br/>which at times produce so much discussion amongst con-
<br/>noisseurs. In this collection it is attributed to Rubens. In
<br/>the Fisch collection sold in the early part of this year,
<br/>there was a picture 5 ft. 6x4 ft. 4 numbered 224 in the second
<br/>part of their Catalogue Raisonneé, termed Lions poursuitants
<br/>un Chevreuil, and the description of which, might without 
<br/>alteration stand for the present painting; indeed so great is
<br/>the similarity of design, grouping of the animals and gen-
<br/>eral composition, that nothing but the difference of size
<br/>would decide that it was not one and the same picture— 
<br/>bought in,	300</div>
         <div class="ab">17. Natoire. The Toilette of Venus—canvass 5 feet 6X6
<br/>feet 5.—The coloring of this picture is mellow and of a 
<br/>pleasing tone; the position of the figures natural, and the 
<br/>head of Venus charmingly executed—Mr. Robb,	325</div>
         <div class="ab">20. Jos. Vernet. A Marine Piece—canvass 8 feet 4x5 feet. 
<br/>—This picture and lot 21 is stated by the catalogue to have
<br/>been engraved—a distinction they richly deserve, being 
<br/>fine compositions of great merit—No. 20 having several
<br/>figures on the foreground, and a ship with sails loose, in
<br/>the centre. The undoubted genuineness and purity of this
<br/> picture ought to have created greater competition—Mr.
<br/> Robb,	950</div>
         <div class="ab">21. J. Vernet. Marine Piece, 10 feetx5 feet—Storm clear-
<br/>ing off— Ship on the Rocks—the inhabitants of the coast 
<br/>rescuing the Passengers.—We know not which to admire
<br/>most in this painting, the boldness of the design, or the
<br/>skillfulness of its execution. The look of nature which
<br/>appears upon the still agitated waters, the position of the
<br/>vessel, the brightening sky dispelling the horrors of the
<br/>storm, all combine to render it a masterpiece—Mr. Watts, 1,000</div>
         <div class="ab">22. Dutch School. View of a Country Palace.—This was a
<br/>delightful composition—the figures small, and designed 
<br/>with a surprising exactness—the clouds transparent, and
<br/>the sky beautifully serene—although without a name in
<br/>the catalogue, was extremely cheap at the selling price—
<br/>Mr. Mawson,	45</div>
         <div class="ab">26. S. Denys. Rich Landscape—canvass 7 feet 6X5 feet 4.—
<br/>This work is distinguished by a warm coloring and an
<br/>agreeable choice of situation; the cattle in the foreground
<br/>are finished with the usual accuracy of this artist—Mr.
<br/>Robb,	725</div>
         <div class="ab">27. S. Denys View of the Bay of Naples—canvass 7 feet
<br/>3—5 feet 2—a companion to the last picture, but of finer 
<br/>quality—the trees being most delicately handle, every leaf 
<br/>touched distinctly; in truth, in every part has the look of 
<br/>nature—Mr. Robb,	1,000</div>
         <div class="ab">30. F. Franch. A Dutch Fair.—Numerous figures, well 
<br/>drawn and nicely painted—Unsold.</div>
         <div class="ab">53. Bassano. The Entrance into the Ark.—The animals in 
<br/>pairs, passing the foreground. The catalogue stated the 
<br/>style of the composition to be solemn and grand. We sup-
<br/>pose it was, for it found a purchaser—Mr.	Marshall,	225</div>
         <div class="ab">60. A. Carracci. Christ and his Disciples at Sea in a Boat—

         <div class="ab">65 &amp; 66. A Pair of Marine Views, said to be by Vernet.—
<br/>The purchaser of these pictures is reputed a lair judge of
<br/>paintings, but from the evident restorations we should have

         <div class="ab">101. Rubens and Sneyders. This was held as the crack pic-
<br/>ture of the collection, and no doubt merited the distinc-
<br/>tion, for all the peculiarities of beauty and imperfection of
<br/>the great master were visible in the group of children oc-
<br/>cupying the centre. The fruit and flowers surrounding 
<br/>a wreath above them, were stated to be by Sneyders. This 
<br/>we think an error, believing the associate master to be
<br/>Seghers; and we are the more inclined to this opinion, see-
<br/>ing that Pilkington mentions a very splendid performance
<br/>then in the Jesuits’ Church at Antwerp—subject by Dan-
<br/>iel Seghers—a Garland of Flowers and Fruits, in which 
<br/>seemed to be collected all that was beautiful in nature of 
<br/>these objects, and in the centre the picture of the Virgin
<br/>and Child, painted by Rubens. However, as it was the 
<br/>practice of Rubens to employ his pupils of talent in the 
<br/>execution of his great designs, and these excellent artists
<br/>so thoroughly understood the nature of tints, and were so 
<br/>expert in their handling, that every picture, although fin-
<br/>ished by the combined works of two or three different hands,
<br/>appeared to have been the composition of one master, it be-
<br/>comes a matter of fine judgment and experience to distin-
<br/>guish correctly the particular hand. The figures in this pic-
<br/>ture representing the Infant Saviour, St. John, and three 
<br/>Angels playing with a Lamb, are disposed with great skill
<br/>in the centre of the foreground, attracting the eye of the
<br/>spectator from the glowing colors of the surrounding ob-
<br/>jects, but appeared to us incorrect in outline, being ex-
<br/>aggerated, the limbs too thick and too short—Not sold.</div>

         <p>Niblo’s.—Mrs. Mowatt, we learn, has been here gath-
<br/>ering fresh laurels in Juliet and other roles. We deeply
<br/>regret that we have not been permitted an opportunity
<br/>of seeing her.</p>
         <p>Park Theatre—Mrs. Bland.—On Saturday last this 
<br/>lady made her first appearance in New-York, in Knowles’
<br/>play of the Hunchback, and again received the most en-
<br/>thusiastic applause from a delighted audience. Her per-
<br/>formance of the Lady of Lyons at once stamped her as an 
<br/>artist of the highest order in her profession; and now,
<br/>that we have witnessed her Julia, we unhesitatingly pro-
<br/>nounce her to be fully equal to any tragedian that has
<br/>ever appeared in this country. When we shall have seen
<br/>her in her various range of characters, it is very possible
<br/>we may give her a still higher rank. Mrs. Bland's ex-
<br/>cellences are not confined to one or two scenes in a play.
<br/>Her conception of a character is perfect from beginning
<br/>to end, and she is equally true to nature, whether pour-
<br/>traying the soft emotions of the heart, the sprightly nai-
<br/>veté of the lady of fashion, or the intense and violent pas-
<br/>sions of remorse, anger or despair. In the latter, indeed,
<br/>she is so truly great that the audience are frequently elec-
<br/>trified, and a breathless attention alone shows their per-
<br/>fect sympathy with the heroine. She possesses, more-
<br/>over, a voice of intense power, of the finest quality, and
<br/>capable of all the varieties of modulation. In the part
<br/>of Julia, Mrs. Bland had the opportunity—rarely met with
<br/>in one play—of exhibiting all these beauties in a very
<br/>prominent degree. We consider the character a very
<br/>difficult one; one, in fact, to test the ability of any ar-
<br/>tist, and to decide her pretensions to the highest rank in
<br/>the histrionic art. This lady, by her performance on Sat-
<br/>urday, has decided this point beyond dispute. It would
<br/>be impossible (not having the book before us) to point out
<br/>to our readers every beauty in her performance, or even
<br/>the most conspicuous of them; but some of the scenes we
<br/>cannot pass over without notice. Her remorse on discov-
<br/>ering that by her own frivolity and apparent heartless-
<br/>ness, she had caused the estrangement of Sir Thomas
<br/>Clifford, blended at the same time with the angry feel-
<br/>ings natural to a high-minded and haughty damsel on be-
<br/>ing schooled by her lover, was most admirably depicted.
<br/>Her struggle between pride and love, ere she determines
<br/>to give her hand to Lord Rochdale, and the reckless des-
<br/>pair with which she seizes the pen and affixes her name
<br/>to the document, were not less favorable points. Her sur-
<br/>prise and emotion on discovering in the voice of the Sec-
<br/>retary, her lover; her many fruitless efforts to look round
<br/>and see if it be really he; her extreme agitation on find-
<br/>ing him at her feet, his arm encircling her waist; and,
<br/>when suddenly aroused to a sense of the danger of her
<br/>situation, she assumes the dignity of an insulted woman,
<br/>and frees herself from his embrace, were all so beautiful-
<br/>ly and forcibly given, that we are disposed to consider
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page197"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>this scene the finest in the whole play; though it would
<br/>be difficult, perhaps, for any thing to exceed the beauty of 
<br/>her acting in the subsequent scene with Master Walter,
<br/>when imploring him not to force her to marry Lord Roch-
<br/>dale. Her wretchedness, and almost utter despair, lest
<br/>there should be no means by which she could with honor
<br/>avoid the detested nuptials, were so true to nature, so ex-
<br/>quisitely pathetic, that cold indeed must have been his
<br/>heart who could have witnessed this scene with an un-
<br/>moistened eye. As a whole, Mrs. Bland’s Julia is highly
<br/>meritorious: and we very much doubt if, in this char-
<br/>acter, she is excelled by any actress on the English
<br/>stage.</p>
         <p>Mr. Bland played Sir Thomas Clifford, a part by no
<br/>means agreeable to the actor, particularly in the latter
<br/>half of the play; but he acquitted himself admirably.—
<br/>This gentleman is an accomplished reader, and poetry
<br/>never loses any of its beauties in his hands. He has much
<br/>judgment and discretion, and a most musical voice, which
<br/>he perfectly well knows how to modulate. We have now
<br/>seen him several times—for he is put into all sorts of parts
<br/>—and have found, invariably, that his excellence increas-
<br/>es in proportion to the difficulty of the character he has to
<br/>represent. He must become an established favorite on the
<br/>Park boards.</p>
         <p>The Hunchback was, altogether, well brought out.— 
<br/>Though there were no striking excellences in the cast of
<br/>the other characters, they were nevertheless very credita-
<br/>bly sustained by Mr. Bass, Mr. De Walden, Mrs. Abbott, 
<br/>&amp;c.</p>

         <div class="head">Musical Department.</div>
         <p>Sacred Music Society.—This Society performed the
<br/>Oratorio of the Seven Sleepers at the Tabernacle on the 
<br/>20th instant. Our remarks last week upon the plot and
<br/>the music of this Oratorio, performed under the direc-
<br/>tion of Mr. George Loder, preclude the necessity of our
<br/>alluding to them again. We must, however, state that
<br/>much of the character of the music was lost, on the se-
<br/>cond representation, through the conductor (Mr. U. C. 
<br/>Hill) mistaking the tempo of several pieces.</p>
         <div class="ab">The following is a cast of the characters:
<br/>Antipater. . . .           Mr. Fraser.
<br/>Honoria, (his Wife) .	.	Mrs. Jameson.
<br/>Martinus, (the Bishop) .	.	Mr. Seguin.
<br/>Malchus,	.	.	.         Miss J. L. Northall.
<br/>Serapion,	...	“ Windmuller.
<br/>Johannes,	...         A Lady Member.
<br/>Constantine,  Sons of Auicianua, Mr. R. Dunning. 
<br/>Dionysius, 	...		D. B. Bell.
<br/>Marianus, 	...	“	R. Andrews.
<br/>Maximianus, 	...	“	F. H. Nash.</div>
         <p>Mr. Fraser sang the music of the Antipater admirably. 
<br/>His voice was in fine order : he sang with feeling and ex-
<br/>pression ; he exhibited a pure and refined taste, and he 
<br/>delivered his recitatives in a straight-forward and ener-
<br/>getic manner, enunciating his words at the same time
<br/>with great distinctness. We have never heard Mr. Fra-
<br/>ser to such advantage, and cannot but compliment him 
<br/>on his careful and excellent performance.</p>
         <p>Mr. Seguin, as the Bishop, was almost all that we
<br/>could have wished. He sang his music with the utmost 
<br/>precision and accuracy, and his beautiful voice added a
<br/>great interest to the fine compositions he had to sing, but
<br/>there was hardly sufficient force and emphasis to his per-
<br/>formance.</p>
         <p>Miss Julia Northall has improved in one respect: she
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>seems almost content to sing the music nearly as it is
<br/>written; she has given over embellishing too lavishly
<br/>the composer’s ideas, and confines herself to a decided re-
<br/>lantando and a trifling cadence at the close. This self-
<br/>denial will work out a vast improvement in her style, 
<br/>which we shall hail with pleasure. There is so much
<br/>good material in Miss Northall, that we should regret to
<br/>see her departing from the road to improvement. She 
<br/>has much to do before she can maintain a first position in
<br/>the profession. One prominent fault in her style, would,
<br/>if carefully regulated, become a positive excellence: we
<br/>allude to her decidedly theatrical method of delivery. 
<br/>This she indulges incessantly, until it loses all effect,
<br/>from the want of judicious eontrast. Miss Northall is
<br/>however very young yet, and we sincerely believe that if
<br/>she at present does not consider herself perfect, but will 
<br/>practise with a view to improvement, she will become a
<br/>very charming singer.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Jameson has a very good voice, and sang the part
<br/>of Honoria quite respectably. She has no particular style
<br/>at present, and requires much schooling; but Mrs. Jame-
<br/>son has every thing in her favor—a good figure, a charm-
<br/>ing face, and a vocal organ capable of high cultivation.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Windmuller gives evidence of some good educa-
<br/>tion; but her extreme fright rendered her incapable of
<br/>doing justice to herself. She sang painfully out of tune
<br/>all the evening.</p>
         <p>A Lady Member has a fine voice, but she is uneducated,
<br/>and does not therefore know how to manage it.</p>
         <p>The chorus singers were very numerous, but the power
<br/>was by no means commensurate with the numbers. We 
<br/>have, however, never heard the choruses so well execu-
<br/>ted upon any previous performance of the Sacred Music
<br/>Society. We account for this naturally enough, from the 
<br/>fact that the principal part of the performers had been
<br/>thoroughly drilled for three or four months by Mr. Loder,
<br/> at his rehearsal of the same Oratorio. But despite of all 
<br/>this drilling, and notwithstanding the excellence of their 
<br/>first performance, they were still unsteady in many points
<br/>and confused in others; particularly in the fugues.</p>
         <p>The band was pretty good, many portions being execu-
<br/>ted with effect, while in the more delicate instrumenta- 
<br/>tion, a great want of lightness was observable; particu-
<br/>larly in Honoria’s recitative, which is descriptive of alarm 
<br/>and agitation. The conductor did not feel this, and the
<br/>result was a want of the correct expression. Most of the 
<br/>principal performers were engaged in Mr. Loder’s repre-
<br/>sentation, and the music ought therefore to have gone
<br/>much smoother.</p>
         <p>Mr. Hill misconceived the tempo in several pieces—in
<br/>the duett between Honoria and Antipater, in the first act,
<br/>which was very much too slow, causing partial interrup-
<br/>tion of the continuous and flowing character of the melody. 
<br/>The duett between Malchus and Serapion was altogether
<br/>too slow; the tempo was totally at variance with the
<br/>character of the composition; and the tempo of Johannes’
<br/>exquisite song was much too fast, by which the grace and
<br/>prophetic tone of the sentiment were destroyed.</p>
         <p>Mr. Hill is a very estimable and worthy man in his pri-
<br/>vate relations; but as a conductor, we can award him but
<br/>little commendation. He certainly strives to make up in 
<br/>perseverance what he wants in knowledge and apprecia-
<br/>tion, but he has made loo many distinct failures to com-
<br/>mand the respect of the performers, without which, one-
<br/>ness of performance in execution and effect can never be 
<br/>secured.</p>
         <p>The President of the Society announced from the or-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page198"/>

            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>chestra that David would be given on the 10th of October.
<br/>We may reasonably expect that this performance will ex-
<br/>hibit some marked degree of excellence, as the Society
<br/>should by this time be up in it, having performed it all
<br/>the time for the last half dozen years.</p>
         <p>Items.—Mr. Templeton has arrived in this city. It is
<br/>his purpose, we understand, to try his fortune writh a class
<br/>of entertainment which Henry Phillips has already tried
<br/>before, and failed to render popular. Mr. Jones, of the 
<br/>Park Theatre, was the first who introduced these musical
<br/>Lectures. He commenced by illustrating the Ancient
<br/>Jewish History, but the public did not support him and 
<br/>he did not continue his services. Mr. Horncastle, that is 
<br/>Professor Horncastle, advertised his Irish Entertainments,
<br/>but the respectability of his Brother militated so strongly
<br/>against him, that his first entertainment was his last, for
<br/>the room was nearly empty. We regret this, because 
<br/>Professor Horncastle is a man of acknowledged talent,
<br/>sings in a chaste and classical style, and we have not a
<br/>doubt that his lectures would have proved well worthy
<br/>public patronage.</p>
         <p>In the face of all these failures, Mr. Templeton is de-
<br/>termined to risk, in the same way, the success which his 
<br/>reputation ought certainly to command, and which it cer-
<br/>tainly would command were he to place himself in any 
<br/>other way before the public. It is just possible to be sure
<br/>that_he may succeed; for success in Music, as in every
<br/>thing else, very frequently depends upon the turning of a
<br/>straw. The public may take it into its head to make
<br/>these entertainments the fashion, and if it do, then Mr.
<br/>Templeton will make a fortune here; for it is an estab-
<br/>lished fact, although not admitted by our neighbors of
<br/>Boston and Philadelphia, that the favorable fiat of the
<br/>New York Public, is a passport for the whole Union.</p>
         <p>We wish for Mr. Templeton’s sake that the public may
<br/>incline towards him, but we wish for our own, that he 
<br/>had brought out with him a Soprano and Basso, and had
<br/>engaged with the Park Management to give a series of 
<br/>Grand Operas. We do not entertain a doubt, that even
<br/>with this division of profits, Mr. Templeton would have
<br/>gained more than his individual experiment will yield
<br/>him. It is a common error for man to grasp at every-
<br/>thing, and the result is most frequently a shadow in place
<br/>of a substance. We trust that such may not be the re-
<br/>sult in Mr. Templeton’s case.</p>
         <p>The Operas were stopped at the Park Theatre for sev-
<br/>eral nights, in consequence of the illness of Miss Deley.
<br/>After the performance on Wednesday week, she was 
<br/>seized with a severe hoarseness, which proved very obsti-
<br/>nate and difficult to overcome. It is a very common thing
<br/>for Singers just come from Europe, to be attacked in this
<br/>way, the more especially if they exert the voice much
<br/>immediately on their arrival.</p>
         <p>We sincerely trust that Miss Deley will shortly recov-
<br/>er her powers.</p>
         <p>The Seven Sleepers, and Beethoven’s Mount of Ol-
<br/>ives.—We call the attention of our readers to the adver-
<br/>tisement in another column,under the above head. The per-
<br/>formance will take place on the 9th inst., at the Taberna-
<br/>cle, and will be under the direction of Mr. George Loder.
<br/>Two such works upon one evening, will form a Musical 
<br/>Entertainment never before equalled in this country. We 
<br/>have every confidence that the performance will he excel-
<br/>lent, and can therefore consistently recommend the public 
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>to attend it. It is just that the people of New York
<br/>should support the spirited undertaking of Mr. Meigs, for
<br/>a better entertainment is given for fifty cents, than the Sa-
<br/>cred Music Society offer, in opposition, for one dollar.</p>
         <p>We trust that all those who wish to enjoy a choice se-
<br/>lection of fine Sacred Music, and at the same time sup-
<br/>port the worthy resident talent, will go to the Taberna-
<br/>cle on the 9th inst.</p>

         <div class="head">Editorial Miscellany.</div>
         <p>Thomas Dunn English, the editor of the “Aristidean,”
<br/>wrote for the “New Mirror,” a short time after it was 
<br/>established, a poem called “Ben Bolt” to which he ap-
<br/>pended his initials. From its simplicity of diction and
<br/>touching truthfulness of narrative, it became popular, and
<br/>being extensively copied, induced the author to ac-
<br/>knowledge it. It runs thus:</p>
         <div class="lg">
            <br/>Don’t you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?
<br/>Sweet Alice whose hair was so brown,
<br/>Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile,
<br/>And trembled with fear at your frown?
<br/>In the old churchyard in the valley, Ben Bolt,
<br/>In a corner obscure and alone,
<br/>They have fitted a slab of the granite so gray,
<br/>And Alice lies under the stone.
<br/>Under the Hickory tree, Ben Bolt,
<br/>Which stood at the foot of the hill,
<br/>Together we’ve lain in the noonday shade,
<br/>And listened to Appleton’s mill.
<br/>The mill-wheel has fallen to pieces, Ben Bolt,
<br/>The rafters have tumbled in,
<br/>And a quiet which crawls round the walls as you gaze,
<br/>Has followed the olden din.
<br/>Do you mind the cabin of logs, Ben Bolt.
<br/>At the edge of the pathless wood,
<br/>And the button-ball tree with its motley limbs,
<br/>Which nigh by the door-step stood?
<br/>The cabin to ruin has gone, Ben Bolt,
<br/>The tree you would seek in vain;
<br/>And where once the lords of the finest waved,
<br/>Grow grass and the golden grain.
<br/>And don’t you remember the school, Ben Bolt.
<br/>With the master so cruel and grim,
<br/>And the shaded nook in the running brook,
<br/>Where the children went to swim? 
<br/>Grass grows on the master’s grave, Ben Bolt.
<br/>The spring of the brook is dry,
<br/>And of all the boys that were schoolmates then,
<br/>There are only you and I.
<br/>There is change in the things I loved, Ben Bolt
<br/>They have changed from the old to the new;
<br/>But I led in the core of any spirit the truth,
<br/>There never was change in you.
<br/>Twelvemonths twenty have past, Ben Bolt.
<br/>Since first we were friends, yet I hail
<br/>Thy presence a blessing, thy friendship a truth—
<br/>Ben Bolt, of the salt-sea  gale.</div>
         <p>Several musical people have attempted to adapt an
<br/>air to these Words; and there are, in consequence, live
<br/>editions of the song afloat, issued under the auspices of 
<br/>various publishers. In some of these a portion of the
<br/>stanzas are taken—and in all there are various errors.
<br/>They are such errors, however, us seem to be without
<br/>intention, and bear every evidence of their accidental na-
<br/>ture. The one before us is of a different kind. It occurs
<br/>on two pages of music and words, published by Oliver &amp;
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page199"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
Ditsen, Washington street, Boston, with the following title:—</p>
         <p>There's a change in the things I love. Composed and respect-
<br/>fully dedicated to his friend B. F. Baker, Esq., by Joseph P: Web-
<br/>ster.</p>
         <p>The evident intention of Mr. Webster is to claim the
<br/>authorship of the words as well as the music—which lat-
<br/>ter has in it nothing remarkable. But whether this is, or
<br/>is not, the intention of Mr. Webster, he has committed a
<br/>most vile fraud upon Mr. English. Instead of printing
<br/>the poem as given above, he gives four of the stanzas
<br/>only, and in the following form—the italics, which mark
<br/>the alterations and additions, being our own:—</p>
         <div class="lg">
            <br/>O don’t you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt,
<br/>Sweet Alice with hair so brown;
<br/>Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile,
<br/>And trembled with fear at your frown.
<br/>In the old church-yard in the Abbey, Ben Bolt,
<br/>In a comer obscure and alone,
<br/>They have fitted a slab of the granite so gray,
<br/>And Alice lies under the stone.
<br/>O don't you remember the wood, Ben Bolt,
<br/>That grew on the green sunny hill;
<br/>Where oft ire bote played ’neath its wide-spreading shade,
<br/>And listened to Appleton’s mill.
<br/>The mill bets gone to decay, Ben Bolt,
<br/>And the rafters have fallen in,
<br/>And a quiet has settled on all around,
<br/>In the place of the olden din.
<br/>O don’t you remember the school, Ben Bolt,
<br/>With the master so cruel and grim; 
<br/>And the quiet nook and the running brook,
<br/>Where the school boys went to swim.
<br/>Grass grows on the master’s grave, Ben Bolt,
<br/>And the running brook is dry:
<br/>And of all the boys who were schoolmates then,
<br/>There is only you and I.
<br/>There's a change in the things I love, Ben Bolt,
<br/>A change from the old to the new;
<br/>But I feel in the core of my heart, Ben Bolt,
<br/>There never was change in you.
<br/>Twelve months—twenty have passed, Ben Bolt,
<br/>But still with delight I hail 
<br/>Thy presence a blessing, thy friendship a truth,
<br/>Ben Bolt of the salt sea gale.</div>
         <p>Now, in the name of the craft of authors we protest
<br/>against such impudent thieving as this. The thing is
<br/>growing to a nuisance. No sooner does a literary man
<br/>produce anything worthy of especial note, than some
<br/>lack-brained fellow—some Mr. Joseph P. Webster—takes
<br/>it up, and either passes it off as his own, or mangles it
<br/>shamefully in an attempt at emendation—or perhaps
<br/>both. If caught, he sneaks off in silence, like a detected
<br/>robber of hen-roosts—if not, he chuckles at his successful
<br/>rascality, and enjoys a reputation obtained for him by
<br/>alien brains.</p>
         <p>Much has been said, of late, about the necessity of
<br/>maintaining a proper nationality in American Letters;
<br/>but what this nationality is, or what is to be gained by
<br/>it, has never been distinctly understood. That an Amer-
<br/>ican should confine himself to American themes, or even
<br/>Prefer them, is rather a political than a literary idea—
<br/>and at best is a questionable point. We would do well
<br/>to bear in mind that “distance lends enchantment to the
<br/>view. Ceteris paribus, a foreign theme is, in a strictly
<br/>literary sense, to be preferred. Alter all, the world at
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>large is the only legitimate stage for the autorial histrio.</p>
         <p>But of the need of that nationality which defends our own
<br/>literature, sustains our own men of letters, upholds our own
<br/>dignity, and depends upon our own resources, there cannot
<br/>be the shadow of a doubt. Yet here is the very point at
<br/>which we are most supine. We complain of our want of an
<br/>International Copyright, on the ground that this want jus-
<br/>tifies our publishers in inundating us with British opinion
<br/>in British books; and yet when these very publishers, at
<br/>their own obvious risk, and even obvious loss, do publish
<br/>an American book, we turn up our noses at it with supreme
<br/>contempt (this as a general thing) until it (the American
<br/>book) has been dubbed “readable” by some illiterate Cock-
<br/>ney critic, Is it too much to say that, with us, the opin-
<br/>ion of Washington Irving—of Prescott—of Bryant—is a
<br/>mere nullity in comparison with that of any anonymous
<br/>sub-sub-editor of The Spectator, The Athenæum or the
<br/>“London Punch”? It is not saying too much, to say
<br/>this. It is a solemn—an absolutely awful fact. Every
<br/>publisher in the country will admit it to he a fact. There
<br/>is not a more disgusting spectacle under the sun than
<br/>our subserviency to British criticism. It is disgusting,
<br/>first, because it is truckling, servile, pusillanimous—sec-
<br/>ondly, because of its gross irrationality. We know the
<br/>British to bear us little but ill will—we know that, in no
<br/>case, do they utter unbiassed opinions of American books
<br/>—we know that in the few instances in which our wri-
<br/>ters have been treated with common decency in England,
<br/>bthese writers have either openly paid homage to English
<br/>institutions, or have had lurking at the bottom of their
<br/>hearts a secret principle at war with Democracy:—we
<br/>know all this, and yet, day after day, submit our
<br/>necks to the degrading yoke of the crudest opinion that
<br/>emanates from the fatherland. Now if we must have
<br/>nationality let it be a nationality that will throw off this
<br/>yoke.</p>
         <p>The chief of the rhapsodists who have ridden us to
<br/>death like the Old Man of the Mountain, is the ignorant
<br/>and egotistical Wilson. We use the term rhapsodists
<br/>with perfect deliberation; for, Macaulay, and Dilke, and
<br/>one or two others, excepted, there is not in Great Britain 
<br/>a critic who can be fairly considered worthy the name.
<br/>The Germans and even the French are infinitely superior. 
<br/>As regards Wilson, no man ever penned worse criticism
<br/>or better rhodomontade. That he is “egotistical” his
<br/>works show to all men, running as they read. That he is
<br/> ignorant” let his absurd and continuous schoolboy blun-
<br/>ders about Homer bear witness. Not long ago we our-
<br/>selves pointed out a series of similar inanities in his re-
<br/>view of Miss Barrett’s poems—a series, we say, of gross
<br/>blunders arising from sheer ignorance—and we defy him
<br/>or any one to answer a single syllable of what we then 
<br/>advanced.</p>
         <p>And yet this is the man whose simple dictum (to our
<br/>shame be it spoken) has the power to make or to mar any
<br/>American reputation! In the last number of Blackwood,
<br/>he has a cotinuation of the dull “Specimens of the nBri
<br/>-tish Critics,” and makes occasion wantonly to insult one
<br/>of the noblest of our poets, Mr. Lowell. The point of the
<br/>whole attack consists in the use of slang epithets and
<br/>phrases of the most ineffably vulgar description. “Squa-
<br/>bashes” is a pet term. “Faugh!” is another. “We are 
<br/>Scotsmen to the spine!' says Sawney—as if the thing were
<br/>not more than self-evidont. Mr. Lowell is called “a mag-
<br/>pie,” an “ape,” a “Yankee cockney,” and his name is
<br/>intentionally mis-written John Russell Lowell. Now
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page200"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>were these indecencies perpetrated by any American 
<br/>critic, that critic would be sent to Coventry by the whole 
<br/>press of the country, but since it is Wilson who insults,
<br/>we, as in duty bound, not only submit to the insult, but
<br/>echo it, as an excellent jest, throughout the length
<br/>and breadth of the land. Quamdiu Catilina? We do
<br/>indeed demand the nationality of self-respect. In Letters
<br/>as in Government we require a Declaration of Inde-
<br/>pendence. A better thing still would be a Declaration of
<br/>War—and that war should be carried forthwith “into Af-
<br/>rica.”</p>
         <p>A Friend “who knows,” writing to us in reference to
<br/>the Whittier and Bulwer parallel, says,</p>
         <p>En passant the gem which you present in your last, as attribu-
<br/>ted to both Whittier and Bulwer “went the rounds,” some years
<br/>ago, as the property of George D. Prentice, to whom by the way,
<br/>more than one of the Abolition poet’s waifs have been awarded.
<br/>A few years back “The Hesperian,” (Gallagher’s Magazine, at
<br/>Columbus, Ohio,) contained a little poem “To a Lady,” beginning
<br/>“We are not strangers,” &amp;c., over the signature of George D.
<br/>Prentice, which had previously appeared in the “New England
<br/>Review,” then conducted by Whittier, over the initials, J. G. W.
<br/>But why speak of these things?—"de minimis nun curat lex."</p>
         <p>The unworthy cabal lately entered into by some of
<br/>our most “influential” citizens, to foist upon the public
<br/>attention, through a concerted movement of puffs anti-
<br/>cipatory, a collection of rather indifferent and very un-
<br/>original verses by one Mr. William W. Lord, has met,
<br/>we rejoice to find, the most signal and universal rebuke.
<br/>Tricks of this kind will scarcely be attempted again. 
<br/>A mere trick it was. Mr. Lord had written some matters
<br/>of which he had an exalted opinion. In New Jersey he
<br/>had for neighbour a very gentlemanly personage con-
<br/>nected with the press. To him application was made,
<br/>and the whole scheme was immediately arranged. Au-
<br/>spice Teucro nothing was to be feared. The press as a
<br/>matter of course, would be dumb—or open its mouth
<br/>only to echo the cos plaudite of the King. Mr. Appleton is
<br/>invited to dinner. Mr. Lord is invited to recite his
<br/>poems; he reads them, we have been informed, with re-
<br/>markable unction. It is decided in full conclave, that
<br/>henceforth he shall be the “American Milton." No
<br/>member of that illustrious assembly ever dreamed that
<br/>there was anything farther to do—for this whole thing
<br/>had, to a certain extent, been repeatedly managed be-
<br/>fore.</p>
         <p>The result has placed Mr. Lord in a very remark-
<br/>able, and certainly in a very amusing position. There
<br/>is no immediate need, however, of his cutting his throat.
<br/>The letter to Mr. Wordsworth, was the most absurd
<br/>of all moves; or if a letter was to be sent to Mr. Words-
<br/>worth, why did Mr. Lord think it necessary to make
<br/>use of Bishop Doanc as an amanuensis—or a catspaw?
<br/>This was hardly fair play. To “one Mr. Lord” beseech-
<br/>ing a complimentary letter about his own poems, the
<br/>patriarch of the Lakes might have had no scruple in
<br/>replying—“Mr. Lord, it is my honest opinion that your
<br/>book is not much better than it should be”—but an
<br/>answer of this kind was clearly impossible from so well-
<br/>bred a man as Wordsworth, to his personal acquaintance,
<br/>the Bishop of New Jersey. This letter then -or this
<br/>presentation copy of the Poems—to Wordsworth was,
<br/>after all, nothing in the world hut trick No. 2. The fact
<br/>is, we are ashamed both of Mr. Lord and of his book.
<br/>His chicaneries have done more to convince the public
<br/>of his utter want of poetic (or of any other kind of) spir-
<br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>it, than even the bombast, egotism, and inanity of “Nia-
<br/>gara” itself.</p>
         <p>There is a rumor that the plates of the Natural Histo-
<br/>ry Department of the Exploring Expedition book are in
<br/>course of preparation either in London or Pans. Have
<br/>we no artists at home—or no soul to sustain them?
<br/>Perhaps the amiable “superintendent of the plates” at
<br/>Washington can afford us some information about the
<br/>truth or falsity of the report in question.</p>
         <p>Among the American books of exceeding merit which,
<br/>through accident, have been nearly overlooked, we may
<br/>mention “George Balcombe,” a novel by Judge Beverly 
<br/>Tucker, of Virginia, and “The Confessions of a Poet,”
<br/>a very vigorous and powerful fiction by the author of
<br/>“The Vision of Rubeta.”</p>
         <p>In our list, last week, of contributors to “The Broad-
<br/>way Journal,” we made some important omissions. We
<br/>have published original articles from Mrs. Osgood, Mrs.
<br/>Ellet, Mrs. Kirkland, Mrs. R. S. Nichols, Mrs. Child,
<br/>Mrs. Lowell, Mrs. Hewitt. Miss Fuller, Miss Mary
<br/>Orme, Miss Colman, Miss Lawson, Miss Wells, W. G.
<br/>Simms, J. R. Lowell, H. R. Schoolcraft, H. T. Tuck-
<br/>erman, Park Benjamin, E. A. Duyckinck, T. D. Eng-
<br/>lish, Wm. Page (the artist), Wm. Wallace, A. M. Ide,
<br/>Jr., Henry B. Hirst, Wm. A. Jones; the author of the
<br/>Vision of Rubeta, Henry C, Watson, Littleton Barry and
<br/>Edgar A. Poe. Our corps of anonymous correspondents
<br/>is, moreover, especially strong.</p>
         <p>In a very complimentary notice, by Miss Fuller, of
<br/>“Tales by Edgar A. Poe,” the critic objects to the phra-
<br/>ses “he had many books but rarely employed them”—
<br/>and “his results, brought about by the very soul and
<br/>essence of method, had, in fact, the whole air of intui-
<br/>tion.” We bow to the well-considered opinions of Miss
<br/>Fuller, whom, of course, we very highly respect—but
<br/>we have in vain endeavored to understand, in these ca-
<br/>ses, the grounds of her objections. Perhaps she will
<br/>explain.</p>
         <p>The London Builder, speaking of extraordinary mo-
<br/>saics, mentions an exquisite specimen—a portrait of Pope
<br/>Paul V., in which the face alone consists of more than a
<br/>million and a half of fragments, each no larger than a
<br/>millet seed; and from this size up to two inches square,
<br/>pieces are employed in various ways. Another celebra-
<br/>ted specimen is that which Napoleon ordered to be made
<br/>when his power was paramount in Italy. It was to be a
<br/>mosaic copy of the celebrated “Last Supper,” by Leon-
<br/>ardo da Vinci; and to be of the same size of the original,
<br/>viz, 24 feet by 12. The artist to whom the task was en-
<br/>trusted was Glacono Raffaelle, and the men under his di-
<br/>rection, eight or ten in number, were engaged for eight
<br/>years on it. The mosaic cost more than seven thousand
<br/>pounds—and afterwards came into the possession of the
<br/>Emperor of Austria.</p>
         <p>We Are Delighted to hear that Wiley and Putnam’s
<br/>“Library of American Books,” is meeting with unequi-
<br/>vocal success. We had feared that Americans would
<br/>condescend to read nothing less than English. Even of
<br/>our own book, more than fifteen hundred copies have been
<br/>sold here.</p>
         <p>The editor of “Graham’s Magazine" assures us that
<br/>certainly he has paid, (according to Dr. Griswold’s con-
<br/>tract.) for Mr. William Jones’articles—hut that he (Mr.
<br/>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page201"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>Graham) has not the slightest inten-
<br/>tion of ever using them. No doubt
<br/>they are at Mr. Jones’ service.</p>
         <p>To Correspondents.—Shall we not'
<br/>again hear from M. O.? Her many
<br/>excellences are appreciated by no one
<br/>more fully than by ourselves. A thou-
<br/>sand thanks to W, G. for the beautiful'

<br/>the great body of readers now seek them as vehi-

         <div class="ab">J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
<br/>-MANUFACTURER OF THE
<br/>IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
<br/>By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
<br/>JF. BROWNE respectfully 'informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
<br/>and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
<br/>281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
<br/>His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties
<br/>imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
<br/>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of 
<br/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
<br/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-
<br/>ture, imported in the usual way.
<br/>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention
<br/>N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.
<br/>J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.</div>
         <div class="ab">Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of
<br/>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
<br/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.
<br/> January, 1845.		I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.</div>
         <div class="ab">Dear Sir :—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city.— 
<br/>The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old
<br/>Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other. Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.
<br/>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.</div>
         <div class="ab">Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society
<br/>Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps.
<br/>The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
<br/>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.</div>
         <div class="ab">Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-
<br/>ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
<br/>ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
<br/>Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure
<br/>in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.
<br/>January 12th, 1845.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.</div>
         <div class="ab">These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of
<br/>making a correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid
<br/>improvements in this delightful Instrument.
