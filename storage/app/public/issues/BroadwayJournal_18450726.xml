            <br></br>BY HIMSELF.
         </div>
         
         <p>I am now growing in years, and--since I understand that
            
            <span class="person" id="wshakespeare">Shakespeare</span> and Mr. Emmons are deceased--it is not impossible that I may even die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as well retire from the field of Letters and
            repose upon my laurels. But I am ambitious of signalizing
            my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I cannot do a better
            thing than just pen for it an account of my earlier career.
            My name, indeed, has been so long and so constantly before
            the public eye, that I am not only willing to admit the naturalness of the interest which it has every where excited, but
            ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired.
            In fact it is no more than the duty of him who achieves greatness, to leave behind him, in his ascent, such landmarks as
            may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore, in the
            present paper, (which I had some idea of calling "Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,") to give
            a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first steps,
            by which, at length, I attained the high road to the pinnacle
            of human renown.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of one's very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say
            much. My father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many
            years at the summit of his profession, which was that of a
            merchant-barber, in the city of Smug. His warehouse was
            the resort of all the principal people of the place, and especially of the editorial corps--a body which inspires all about
            it with profound veneration and awe. For my own part, I
            regarded them as Gods, and drank in with avidity the rich wit
            and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august
            mouths during the process of what is styled "lather." My
            first moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that
            ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the
            "Gad-Fly," in the intervals of the important process just
            mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,
            an inimitable poem in honor of the "Only Genuine Oil-ofBob," (so called from its talented inventor, my father,) and
            for which effusion the editor of the "Fly" was remunerated
            with a regal liberality, by the firm of Thomas Bob and company, merchant barbers.
         </p>
         
         <p>The genius of the stanzas to the "Oil-of-Bob" first breathed into me, I say, the divine afflatus. I resolved at once to
            become a great man and to commence by becoming a great
            poet. That very evening I fell upon my knees at the feet
            of my father.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Father," I said, "pardon me!--but I have a soul above
            lather. It is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would
            be an editor--I would be a poet--I would pen stanzas to
            the 'Oil-of-Bob.' Pardon me and aid me to be great!"
         </p>
         
         <p>"My dear Thingum," replied my father, (I had been
            christened Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,)
            "My dear Thingum," he said, raising me from my knees by
            the ears--"Thingum, my boy, you're a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. You have an immense
            head, too, and it must hold a great many brains. This
            I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you
            a lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel,
            and that of a politician don't pay. Upon the whole you
            judge wisely;--the trade of editor is best:--and if you can
            be a poet at the same time,--as most of the editors are, by
            the by,--why you will kill two birds with one stone. To
            encourage you in the beginning of things, I will allow you a
            garret; pen, ink and paper; a rhyming dictionary; and a
            copy of the 'Gad-Fly.' I suppose you would scarcely demand any more."
         </p>
         
         <p>"I would be an ungrateful villain if I did," I replied with
            enthusiasm. "Your generosity is boundless. I will repay
            it by making you the father of a genius."
         </p>
         
         <p>Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to
            my poetical labors; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my
            hopes of ultimate elevation to the editorial chair.
         </p>
         
         <p>In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to
            "The Oil-of-Bob" rather a draw-back than otherwise.
            Their splendor more dazzled than enlightened me. The
            contemplation of their excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with my own abortions; so that for
            a long time I labored in vain. At length there came into
            my head one of those exquisitely original ideas which now
            and then will permeate the brain of a man of genius. It
            was this:--or, rather, thus was it carried into execution.
            From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them
            to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be
            a translation of one 
            <span class="person" id="dalighieri">Dante</span>'s "Inferno," I copied with remarkable neatness a long passage about a man named Ugolino, who had a parcel of brats. From another which contained a good many old plays by some person whose name
            I forget, I extracted in the same manner, and with the same
            care, a great number of lines about "angels" and "ministers
            saying grace," and "goblins damned," and more besides of
            that sort. From a third, which was the composition of some
            blind man or other, either a Greek or a Choctaw--I cannot
            be at the pains of remembering every trifle exactly--I took
            about fifty verses beginning with "Achilles' wrath," and
            "grease," and something else. From a fourth, which I recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page
            or two all about "hail" and "holy light;" and although a
            blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses
            were sufficiently good in their way.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having made fair copies of these poems I signed everyone
            of them "Oppodeldoc," (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing
            each up nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to
            each of the four principal Magazines, with a request for
            speedy insertion and prompt pay. The result of this well
             
            conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have
            saved me much trouble in after life,) served to convince me
            that some editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the
            coup-de-grace (as they say in France,) to my nascent hopes,
            (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)
         </p>
         
         <p>The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in
            question, gave Mr. "Oppodeldoc' a complete using-up, in
            the "Monthly Notices to Correspondents." The "HumDrum" gave him a dressing after this fashion:
         </p>
         
         <p>"'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,) has sent us a long tirade concerning a bedlamite whom he styles 'Ugolino," who had a great 
            many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed 
            without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame--not
            to say flat. 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid of
            imagination--and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not only
            the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. Oppodeldoc,' (whoever
            he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his twattle, a 'speedy
            insertion and prompt pay.' We neither insert nor purchase any
            stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt, however, that he would
            meet with a ready sale for all the balderdash he can scribble, at the
            office of either the 'Rowdy-Dow,' the 'Lollipop,' or the 'Goosetherumfoodle.'"
         </p>
         
         <p>All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon
            "Oppodeldoc"--but the unkindest cut was putting the word
            Poesy in small caps. In those five preeminent letters what
            a world of bitterness is there not involved!
         </p>
         
         <p>But "Oppodeldoc" was punished with equal severity in
            the "Rowdy-dow," which spoke thus:
         </p>
         
         <p>"We have received a most singular and insolent communication
            from a person, (whoever he is,) signing himself 'Oppodeldoc'--
            thus desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so
            named. Accompanying the letter of 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he
            is,) we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant
            about 'angels and ministers of grace'--rant such as no madman
            short of a Nat Lee, or an 'Oppodeldoc,' could possibly perpetrate.
            And for this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to 'pay
            promptly.' No sir--no! We pay for nothing of that sort. Apply
            to the 'Hum-Drum,' the 'Lollipop,' or the 'Goosetherumfoodle.'
            These periodicals will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you
            may send them--and as undoubtedly promise to pay for it."
         </p>
         
         <p>This was bitter indeed upon poor "Oppodeldoc but, in
            this instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the "Humdrum," the "Lollipop," and the "Goosetherumfoodle," who
            are pungently styled "periodicals" -- in Italics, too -- a
            thing that must have cut them to the heart.
         </p>
         
         <p>Scarcely less savage was the "Lollipop," which thus
            discoursed:
         </p>
         
         <p>"Some individual, who rejoices in the appellation 'Oppodeldoc,'
            (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often
            applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses, commencing
            after this fashion:
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
            
            <br></br>Of woes unnumbered, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
         </div>
         
         <p>'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that
            there is not a printer's devil in our office who is not in the daily habit of composing better lines. Those of 'Oppodeldoc' will not scan.
            'Oppodeldoc' should learn to count. But why he shouldehave conceived the idea that we, (of all others, we!) would disgrace our
            pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly beyond comprehension
            Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good enough for the 'HumDrum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow,' the 'Goosetherumfoodle'--things that
            are in the practice of publishing 'Mother Goose's Melodies' as orinal lyrics. And 'Oppodeldoc, (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand pay for this drivel. Does 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,) know--is he aware that we could not be paid to insert
            it?"
         </p>
         
         <p>As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller
            and smaller, and when I came to the point at which the editor sneered at the poem as "verses," there was little more
            than an ounce of me left. As for "Oppodeldoc" I began to
            experience compassion for the poor fellow. But the "Goosetherumfoodle" showed, if possible, less mercy than the "Lollipop." It was the "Goosetherumfoodle" that said:
         </p>
         
         <p>"A wretched poetaster, who signs himself 'Oppodeldoc,' is silly
            enough to fancy that we will print and pay for a medley of incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to us,
            and which commences with the following most intelligible line:
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>"Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born."
         </div>
         
         <p>"We say, 'most intelligible.' 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,)
            will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how 'hail' can be 'holy
            light.' We always regarded it as frozen rain. Will he inform us,
            also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same time, both 'holy
            light,' (whatever that is,) and an 'offspring?'--which latter term, (if
            we understand any thing about English,) is only employed, with
            propriety, in reference to small babies of about six weeks old. But
            it is preposterous to descant upon such absurdity--although 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is,) has the unaparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only 'insert' his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) pay for them!
         </p>
         
         <p>"Now this is fine--it is rich!--and we have half a mind to
            punish 'his young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his
            ffusion, verbatim et literatim, as he has written it. We could inflict no punishment so severe, and we would inflict it, but for the
            boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Let 'Oppodeldoc,' (whoever he is.) send any future composition
            of like character to the ' Hum-Drum,' the 'Lollipop,' or the ' Rowdy-Dow.' They will 'insert' it. They 'insert' every month just
            such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with impunity."
         </p>
         
         <p>This made an end of me; and as for the "Hum-Drum,"
            the "Rowdy-Dow," and the "Lollipop," I never could comprehend how they survived it. The putting them in the
            smallest possible minion, (that was the rub--thereby insinuating their lowness--their baseness,) while WE stood looking down upon them in gigantic capitals!--oh it was too bitter!--it was wormwood--it was gall. Had I been either of
            these periodicals I would have spared no pains to have the
            "Goosetherumfoodle" prosecuted. It might have been done
            under the Act for the "Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."
            As for "Oppodeldoc," (whoever he was,) I had by this time
            lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him
            no longer. He was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,)
            and got not a kick more than he deserved.
         </p>
         
         <p>The result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in the first place, that "honesty is the best policy,"
            and, in the second, that if I could not write better than Mr.
            
            <span class="person" id="dalighieri">Dante</span>, and the two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it
            would, at least, be a difficult matter to write worse. I took
            heart, therefore, and determined to prosecute the "entirely
            original," (as they say on the covers of the magazines,) at
            whatever cost of study and pains. I again placed before my
            eyes, as a model, the brilliant stanzas on "The Oil-of-Bob,"
            by the editor of the "Gad-Fly," and resolved to construct an
            Ode on the same sublime theme, in rivalry of what had already been done.
         </p>
         
         <p>With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran
            thus:
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>To pen an Ode upon the "Oil-of-Bob."
         </div>
         
         <p>Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate
            rhymes to "Bob," I found it impossible to proceed. In this
            dilemma I had recourse to paternal aid; and, after some hours
            of mature thought, my father and myself thus constructed
            the poem:
         </p>
          
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>To pen an Ode upon the "Oil-of-Bob"
            
            <br></br>Is all sorts of a job.
            
            <br></br>(Signed,)	Snob.
         </div>
         
         <p>To be sure this composition was of no very great length-but I "have yet to learn" as they say in the Edinburgh Re
            view, that the mere extent of a literacy work has any thing
            to do with its merit. As for the Quarterly cant about
            "sustained effort," it is impossible to see the sense of it.
            Upon the whole, therefore, I was satisfied with the success
            of my maiden attempt, and now the only question regarded
            the disposal I should make of it. My father suggested that I
            should send it to the "Gad-Fly"--but there were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I dreaded
            the jealousy of the editor--and I had ascertained that he did
            not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due
            deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified
            pages of the "Lollipop," and awaited the event in anxiety,
            but with resignation.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the very next published number I had the proud satisfaction of seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading
            article, with the following significant words, prefixed in italics and between brackets:
         </p>
         
         <p>[" We cali the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable
            stanzas on "The Oil-of-Bob." We need say nothing of their sublimity, or of their pathos:--it is impossible to peruse them without
            tears. Those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on the same
            august topic from the goose-quill of the editor of the "Gad-Fly,"
            will do well to compare the two compositions.
         </p>
         
         <p>P. S. We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which
            envelops the evident pseudonym "Snob." May we not hope for a
            personal interview?"]
         </p>
         
         <p>All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I confess, rather more than I had expected:--I acknowledge this,
            be it observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and
            of mankind. I lost no time, however, in calling upon the
            editor of the "Lollipop," and had the good fortune to find
            this gentleman at home. He saluted me with an air of profound respect, slightly blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration, wrought in him, no doubt, by my appearance
            of extreme youth and inexperience. Begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon the subject of my poem;--but
            modesty will ever forbid me to repeat the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies of Mr.
            Crab, (such was the editor's name,) were, however, by no
            means fulsomely indiscriminate. He analyzed my composition with much freedom and great ability--not hesitating to
            point out a few trivial defects--a circumstance which elevated him highly in my esteem. The "Gad-Fly" was, of
            course, brought upon the tapis, and I hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching, or to rebukes so withering,
            as were bestowed by Mr. Crab upon that unhappy effusion.
            I had been accustomed to regard the editor of the "Gad-Fly"
            as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon disabused me
            of that idea. He set the literary as well as the personal character of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated the rival
            editor,) in its true light. He, the Fly, was very little better
            than he should be. He had written infamous things. He
            was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He was a villain.
            He had composed a tragedy which set the whole country in
            a guffaw, and a farce which deluged the universe in tears.
            Besides all this, he had the impudence to pen what he meant
            for a lampoon upon himself, (Mr. Crab,) and the temerity to
            style him "an ass." Should I at any time wish to express
            my opinion of Mr. Fry, the pages of the "Lollipop," Mr.
            Crab assured me, were at my unlimited disposal. In the
            meantime, as it was very certain that I would be attacked in
            the Fly for my attempt at composing a rival poem o
            Oil-of-Bob," he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon himself to
            attend, pointedly, to my private and personal interests. If I
            were not made a man of at once, it should not be the fault
            of himself, (Mr. Crab.)
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter
            portion of which I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ventured to suggest something about the remuneration which
            I had been taught to expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the "Lollipop," declaring that it, (the
            "Lollipop,") "insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted contributions;--frequently expending more money for a single brief poem than the whole annual cost of the 'Hum-Drum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow,' and the
            'Goosetherumfoodle' combined."
         </p>
         
         <p>As I mentioned the word "remuneration," Mr. Crab first
            opened his eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable
            extent: causing his personal appearance to resemble that of
            a highly-agitated elderly duck in the act of quacking;--and
            in this condition he remained, (ever and anon pressing his
            hands tightly to his forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until I had nearly made an end of what I had
            to say.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if
            much overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side,
            but keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion
            of the duck. While I remained in speechless astonishment
            at behaviour so alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and
            made a rush at the bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he
            appeared to have altered his intention, whatever it was, for
            he dived under a table and immediately re-appeared with a
            cudgel. This he was in the act of uplifting, (for what purpose I am at a loss to imagine,) when, all at once, there came
            a benign smile over his features, and he sank placidly back
             in his chair.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Mr. Bob," he said, (for I had sent up my card before ascending myself,) "Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume
            --very?"
         </p>
         
         <p>I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third
            lustrum.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Ah!" he replied, "very good! I see how it is--say no
            more! Touching this matter of compensation, what you ob serve is very just: in fact it is excessively so. But--ah--ah
            --the first contribution--the first, I say--it is never the Magazine custom to pay for--you comprehend, eh? The truth
            is, we are usually the recipients in such case." [Mr. Crab
            smiled blandly as he emphasized the word "recipients."]
            "For the most part, we are paid for the insertion of a maiden
            attempt--especially in verse. In the second place, Mr. Bob,
            the Magazine rule is never to disburse what we term in
            France the argent comptant:--I have no doubt you understand. In a quarter or two after publication of the article-or in a year or two--we make no objection to giving our note
            at nine months:--provided always that we can so arrange
            our affairs as to be quite certain of a 'burst up' in six. I
            really do hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this explanation as satisfactory." Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the
            tears stood in his eyes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently,
            the cause of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I
            hastened to apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my
            perfect coincidence with his views, as well as my entire appreciation of the delicacy of his position. Having done all
            this in a neat speech, I took leave.
         </p>
         
         <p>One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, "I awoke and
            found myself famous." The extent of my renown will e
            best estimated by reference to the editorial opinions of the
             
            day. These opinions, it will be seen, were embodied in critical notices of the number of the Lollipop" containing my
            poem, and are perfectly satisfactory, conclusive and clear
            with the exception, perhaps, of the hieroglyphical marks
            "Sep. 15--1 t."	appended to each of the critiques.
         </p>
         
         <p>The "Owl," a journal of profound sagacity, and well
            known for the deliberate gravity of its literary decisions--the
            "Owl," I say, spoke as follows:
         </p>
         
         <p>"'THE LOLLIPOP!' The October number of this delicious Magazine surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance.
            In the beauty of its typography and paper--in the number and excellence of its steel plates--as well as in the literary merit of its contributions--the 'Lollipop' compares with its slow-paced rivals as
            Hyperion with a Satyr. The 'Hum-Drum.' the 'Rowly-Dow,' and
            the 'Goosetherumfoodle,' excel, it is true, in braggadocio, but, in
            all other points, give us the 'Lollipop!' How this celebrated jour
            nal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we
            can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation of 100,000, and
            its subscription-list has increased one fourth during the last month:
            but, on the other hand, the sums it disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. It is reported that Mr. Slyass received
            no less than thirty-seven and a half cents for his inimitable paper on
            'Pigs.' With Mr. Crab, as editor, and with such names upon the
            list of contributors as Snob and Slyass, there can be no such word as
            'fail' for the 'Lollipop.' Go and subscribe. Sep. 15--1t."
         </p>
         
         <p>I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice
            from a paper so respectable as the "Owl." The placing my
            name--that is to say my nom de guerre--in priority of station
            to that of the great Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I
            felt it to be deserved.
         </p>
         
         <p>My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in
            the "Toad"--a print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and independence--for its entire freedom from sycophancy and subservience to the givers of dinners.
         </p>
         
         <p>"The 'Lollipop' for October is out in advance of all its contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the splendor of
            its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its literary contents,
            The 'Hum-Drum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow,' and the 'Goosetherumfoodle' excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all other points,
            give us the "Lollipop" How this celebrated Magazine can sustain
            its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand.
            To be sure, it has a circulation of 200,000, and its subscription list
            has increased one third during the last fortnight, but on the other
            hand, the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are fearfully
            great. We learn that Mr. Mumblelhumb received no less than fifty
            cents for his late 'Monody in a Mud-Puddle.'
         </p>
         
         <p>"Among the original contributors to the present number we notice, (besides the eminent editor, Mr. Crab.) such men as Snob,
            Slyass, and Mumblethumb. Apart from the editorial matter, the
            most valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by
            'Snob,' on the 'Oil-of-Bob'--but our readers must not suppose,
            from the title of this incomparable bijou, that it bears any similitude
            to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain contemptible
            individual whose name is unmentionable to ears polite. The present poem 'On the Oil-of-Bob,' has excited universal anxiety and
            curiosity in respect to the owner of the evident pseudonym, 'Snob'
            --a curiosity which, happily, we have it in our power to satisfy.
            'Snob' is the nom-de-plume of Mr. Thingum Bob, of this city,--a
            relative of the great Mr. Thingum, (after whom he is named,) and
            otherwise connected with the most illustrious families of the State.
            His father, Thomas Bob, Esq., is an opulent merchant in Smug.
            Sep. 15--1 t."
         </p>
         
         <p>This generous approbation touched me to the heart--the
            more especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly-so proverbially pure as the "Toad." The word "balderdash," as applied to the "Oil-of-Bob" of the Fly, I considered
            singularly pungent and appropriate. The words "gem" and
            "bijou," however, used in reference to my composition,
            struck me as being, in some degree, feeble. They seemed
             to me to be deficient in force. They were not sufficiently
            prononces, (as we have it in France.)
         </p>
         
         <p>I had hardly finished reading the "Toad," when a friend
            placed in my hands a copy of the "Mole," a daily, enjoying
            high reputation for the keenness of its perception about matters in general, and for the open, honest, above-ground style
            of its editorials. The "Mole" spoke of the "Lollipop" as
            follows:
         </p>
         
         <p>"We have just received the 'Lollipop' for October, and must say
            that never before have we perused any single number of any periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak advisedly.
            The 'Hum-Drum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow' and the 'Goosetherumfoodle'
            must look well to their laurels. These prints, no doubt, surpass
            every thing in loudness of pretension, but, in all other points, give
            us the 'Lollipop!' How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its
            evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can comprehend.
            To be sure, it hits a circulation of 300,000; and its subscription-list
            has increased one half within the last week, but then the sum it disburses, monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. We
            have it upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no less
            than sixty-two cents and a half for his late Domestic Nouvelette, the
            'Dish-Clout.'
         </p>
         
         <p>"The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the
            eminent editor,) Snob, Mumblelhumb, Fatquack and others; but,
            after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we prefer a
            diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who writes
            over the signature 'Snob'--a nom de guerre which we predict will
            one day extinguish the radiance of '
            <span class="person" id="cdickens">Boz</span>.' 'Snob,' we learn, is a
            Mr. Thingum Bob, sole heir of a wealthy merchant of this city,
            Thomas Bob. Esq., and a near relative of the distinguished Mr.
            Thingum. The title of Mr. B.'s admirable poem is the 'Oil-of-Bob'
            --a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-bye, as some contemptible
            vagabond connected with the penny press has already disgusted the
             town with a great deal of drivel upon the same topic. There will
            be no danger, however, of confounding the compositions. Sep. 15
            --1 t."
         </p>
         
         <p>The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as
            the "Mole" penetrated my soul with delight. The only objection which occurred to me was, that the terms "contemptible vagabond" might have been better written "odious
            and contemptible, wretch, villain and vagabond." This would
            have sounded more gracefully, I think. "Diamond-like,"
            also, was scarcely, it will be admitted, of sufficient intensity
             to express what the "Mole" evidently thought of the brilliancy
            of the "Oil-of-Bob."
         </p>
         
         <p>On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the
            "Owl," the "Toad," and the "Mole," I happened to meet
            with a copy of the "Daddy-Long-Legs," a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent of its understanding. And it was
            the "Daddy-Long Legs" which spoke thus:
         </p>
         
         <p>"The 'Lollipop'!! This gorgeous Magazine is already before
            the public for October. The question of pre-eminence is forever
            put to rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the
            'Hum-Drum,' the 'Rowdy-Dow,' or the 'Goosetherumfoodle,' to
            make any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. These journals may excel the 'Lollipop' in outcry, but, in all other points, give
            us the 'Lollipop!' How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its
            evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. To be sure
            it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its subscription-list
            has increased seventy-five per cent, within the last couple of days;
            but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are
            scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the fact, that Mademoiselle
            Cribalittle received no lets than eighty-seven cents and a half for
            her late valuable Revolutionary Tale, entitled 'The York-Town
            Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill Katy-Did'nt.'
         </p>
         
         <p>"The most able papers in the present number, are, of course,
            those furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. CRAB.) but there
             
            are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as Snob;
            Mademoiselle Cribalittle; Slyass; Mrs. Fibalittle; Mumblethumb;
            Mrs. Squibalittle; and. last, though not least, Fatquack. The world
            may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of genius.
         </p>
         
         <p>"The poem over the signature 'SNOB' is, we find, attracting universal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves, if
            possible, even more applause than it has received. The 'Oil-ofBob' is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and art. One or
            two of our readers may have a very faint, although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem (?) similarly entitled, the perpetra_
            tion of a miserable penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent
            prints about the purlieus of the city; we beg them, for God's sake,
            not to confound the compositions. The author of the 'Oil-of.Bob,
            is, we hear, Thingum Bob, Fsq.. a gentleman of high genius, and
            a scholar. 'Snob' is merely a nom-de-guerre. Sept. 15--1 t."
         </p>
         
         <p>I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused
            the concluding portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me
            that the yea-nay manner--not to say the gentleness--the
            positive forbearance with which the "Daddy-Long-Legs"
            spoke of that pig, the editor of the "Gad-Fly"--it was evident to me, I say, that this gentleness of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for the Fly--whom
            it was clearly the intention of the "Daddy-Long-Legs" to
            elevate into reputation at my expense. Any one, indeed,
            might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real design of
            the "Daddy" been what it wished to appear, it, (the "Daddy,") might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more
            pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. The words
            "penny-a-liner," "mendicant," "scullion," and "cut-throat,"
            were epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as
            to be worse than nothing when applied to the author of the
            very worst stanzas ever penned by one of the human race.
            We all know what is meant by "damning with faint praise,"
            and, on the other hand, who could fail seeing through the
            covert purpose of the "Daddy"--that of glorifying with
            feeble abuse?
         </p>
         
         <p>What the "Daddy" chose to say of the Fly, however, was
            no business of mine. What it said of myself was. After the
            noble manner in which the "Owl," the "Toad," the
            "Mole," had expressed themselves in respect to my ability,
            it was rather too much to be cooly spoken of by a thing like
            the "Daddy-Long-Legs," as merely "a gentleman of high
            genius and a scholar." Gentleman indeed! I made up my
            mind, at once, either to get a written apology from the
            "Daddy-Long-Legs," or to call it out.
         </p>
         
         <p>Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend
            whom I could entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and,
            as the editor of the "Lollipop" had given me marked tokens
            of regard, I at length concluded to seek assistance upon the
            present occasion.
         </p>
         
         <p>I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory to my own understanding, for the very peculiar countenance and demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me,
            as I unfolded to him my design. He again went through
            the scene of the bell-rope and cudgel, and did not omit the
            duck. At one period I thought he really intended to quack.
            His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided as before, and he began
            to act and speak in a rational way. He declined bearing the
            cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me from sending it at
            all; but was candid enough to admit that the "DaddyLong-Legs" had been disgracefully in the wrong--more especially in what related to the epithets "gentleman and
            scholar."
         </p>
         
         <p>Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who
            really appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare,
            he suggested to me that I might turn an honest penny and,
            at the same time, advance my reputation, by occasionally
            playing Thomas Hawk for the "Lollipop."
         </p>
         
         <p>I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas
            Hawk, and how it was expected that I should play him.
         </p>
         
         <p>Here Mr. Crab again "made great eyes," (as we say in
            Germany,) but at length, recovering himself from a profound
            attack of astonishment, he assured me that he employed the
            words "Thomas Hawk" to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy,
            which was low--but that the true idea was Tommy Hawk
            --or tomahawk--and that by "playing tomahawk" he referred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise using-up the
            herd of poor-devil authors.
         </p>
         
         <p>I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly
            resigned to the task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon
            Mr. Crab desired me to use-up the editor of the "Gad-Fly"
            forthwith, in the fiercest style within the scope of my ability,
            and as a specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot,
            in a review of the original "Oil-of-Bob," occupying thirtysix pages of the "Lollipop." I found playing Thomas
            Hawk, indeed, a far less onerous occupation than poetizing;
            for I went upon system altogether, and thus it was easy to
            do the thing thoroughly and well. My practice was this.
            I bought auction copies (cheap) of "Lord 
            <span class="person" id="hpbrougham">Brougham</span>'s
            Speeches," "
            <span class="person" id="wcobbett">Cobbett</span>'s Complete Works," the "New SlangSyllabus," the "Whole Art of Snubbing," "Prentice's Billingsgate," (folio edition,) and "
            <span class="person" id="lgclark">Lewis G. Clarke</span> on Tongue."
            These works I cut up thoroughly with a curry-comb, and
            then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully
            all that might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving
            the hard phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could
            get through without material injury. The mixture was then
            ready for use. When called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I
            anointed a sheet of fools-cap with the while of a gander's
            egg; then, shredding the thing to be reviewed as I had previously shredded the books,--only with more care, so as to
            get every word separate--I threw the latter shreds in with
            the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a shake,
            and so dusted out the mixture upon the egg'd foolscap;
            where it stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was
            captivating. Indeed the reviews I brought to pass by this
            simple expedient have never been approached, and were the
            wonder of the world. At first, through bashfulness--the result of inexperience--I was a little put out by a certain inconsistency--a certain air of the bizarre, (as we say in
            France,) worn by the composition as a whole. All the
            phrases did not fit, (as we say in the Anglo-Saxon.) Many
            were quite awry. Some, even, were up-side-down; and
            there were none of them which were not, in some measure,
            injured, in regard to effect, by this latter species of accident,
            when it occurred:--with the exception of Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="lgclark">Lewis Clarke</span>'s
            paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether stout,
            that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory,
            whether on their heads, or on their heels.
         </p>
         
         <p>What became of the editor of the "Gad-Fly," after the
            publication of my criticism on his "Oil-of-Bob," it is somewhat difficult to determine. The most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept himself to death. At all events he disappeared instantaneously from the face of the earth, and no
            man has seen even the ghost of him since.
         </p>
         
         <p>This matter having been properly accomplished, and
            the Furies appeased, I grew at once into high favor with
            Mr. Crab. He took me into his confidence, gave me a permanent situation as Thomas Hawk of the "Lollipop," and
            as, for the present, he could afford me no salary, allowed me
             
            to profit, at discretion, by his advice.
         </p>
         
         <p>"My Dear Thingum," said he to me one day after dinner,
            "I respect your abilities and love you as a son. You shall
            be my heir. When I die I will bequeath you the 'Lollipop.'
            In the meantime I will make a man of you--I will-- provided always that you follow my counsel. The first thing to
            do is to get rid of the old bore."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Boar?" said I inquiringly--"pig, eh?--aper? (as we
            say in Latin)--who?--where?
         </p>
         
         <p>"Your father," said he.</p>
         
         <p>"Precisely," I replied,--"pig."</p>
         
         <p>"You have your fortune to make, Thingum," resumed
            Mr. Crab. "and that governor of yours is a millstone about
            your neck. We must cut him at once." [Here I took out
            my knife.] "We must cut him," continued Mr. Crab, "decidedly and forever. He won't do--he won't. Upon seccond thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane him, or
            something of that kind."
         </p>
         
         <p>What do you say," I suggested modestly, "to my kicking
            him in the first instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by tweaking his nose?"
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and
            then answered:
         </p>
         
         <p>"I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer
            sufficiently well--indeed remarkably well--that is to say, as
            far as it went--but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and
            I think, upon the whole, that, having performed upon Thomas Bob the operations you suggest, it would be advisable to
            blacken, with your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and
            thoroughly, to prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades. After doing this, I really do not perceive
            that you can do any more. However--it might be just as
            well to roll him once or twice in the gutter, and then put
            him in charge of the police. Any time the next morning
            you can call at the watch-house and swear an assault.
         </p>
         
         <p>I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards
            me personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice
            of Mr. Crab, and I did not fail to profit by it forthwith.
            The result was, that I got rid of the old bore, and began to
            feel a little independent and gentleman-like. The want of
            money, however, was, for a few weeks, a source of some
            discomfort; but at length, by carefully putting to use my
            two eyes, and observing how matters went just in front of
            my nose, I perceived how the thing was to be brought about.
            I say "thing"--be it observed--for they tell me the Latin
            for it is rem. By the way, talking of Latin, can any one tell
            me the meaning of quocunque--or what is the meaning of
            modo?
         </p>
         
         <p>My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a
            sixteenth of the "Snapping-Turtle:"--that was all. The
            thing was done, and I put money in my purse. There were
            some trivial arrangements afterwards, to be sure; but these
            formed no portion of the plan. They were a consequence--a
            result. For example, I bought pen, ink and paper, and put
            them into furious activity. Having thus completed a Magazine article, I gave it, for appellation, "Fol-Lol, by the Author
            of 'The Oil-of-Bob,'" and enveloped it to the "Goosetherumfoodle." That journal, however, having pronounced it
            "twattle" in the "Monthly Notices to Correspondents," I
            reheaded the paper "'Hey-Diddle-Diddle' by Thingum Bob,
            Esq., Author of the Ode on 'The Oil-of-Bob,' and Editor of
            the 'Snapping-Turtle.'" With this amendment, I reenclosed it to the "Goosetherumfoodle," and, while I awaited a
            reply, published daily, in the "Turtle," six columns of what
            may be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of
            the literary merits of the "Goosetherumfoodle," as well as 
            of the personal character of the editor of the "Goosetherumfoodle." At the end of a week the "Goosetherunifoodle"
            discovered that it had, by some odd mistake, "confounded a
            stupid article, headed 'Hey-Diddle-Diddle' and composed by
            some unknown ignoramus, with a gem of resplendent lustre
            similarly entitled, the work of Thingum Bob, Esq., the celebrated author of 'The Oil-of-Bob.'" The "Goosetherumfoodle" deeply "regretted this very natural accident," and promised, moreover, an insertion of the genuine 'Hey-DiddleDiddle' in the very next number of the Magazine.
         </p>
         
         <p>The fact is I thought--I really thought--I thought at the
            time--I thought then--and have no reason for thinking otherwise now--that the "Goosetherumfoodle" did make a mistake. With the best intentions in the world, I never knew
            any thing that made as many singular mistakes as the
            "Goosetherumfoodle." From that day I took a liking to the
            "Goosetherumfoodle," and the result was I soon saw into
            the very depths of its literary merits, and did not fail to expatiate upon them, in the "Turtle," whenever a fitting opportunity occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very peculiar coincidence--as one of those positively remarkable coincidences which set a man to serious thinking--that just
            such a total revolution of opinion--just such entire bouleversement, (as we say in French,)--just such thorough topsiturviness, (if I may be permitted to employ a rather forcible
            term of the Choctaws,) as happened, pro and con, between
            myself on the one part, and the "Goosetherunifoodle" on
            the other, did actually again happen, in a brief period afterwards, and with precisely similar circumstances, in the case
            of myself and the "Rowdy-Dow," and in the case of myself
            and the "Hum-Drum."
         </p>
         
         <p>Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length
            consummated my triumphs by "putting money in my purse"
            and thus may be said really and fairly to have commenced
            that brilliant and eventful career which rendered me illustrious, and which now enables me to say, with Chateaubriand, "I have made history"--"I'ai fait l'histoire."
         </p>
         
         <p>I have indeed "made history." From the bright epoch
            which I now record, my actions--my works--are the property of mankind. They are familiar to the world. It is,
            then, needless for me to detail how, soaring rapidly, I fell
            heir to the "Lollipop"--how I merged this journal in the
            "Hum-Drum"--how again I made purchase of the "Rowdy-Dow," thus combining the three periodicals--how, lastly,
            I effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united
            all the literature of the country in one magnificent Magazine,
            known every where as the
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">"Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,
            
            <br></br>and
            
            <br></br>GOOSETHERUMFOODLE."
         </div>
         
         <p>Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It extends to the uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take
            up a common newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the immortal Thingum Bob. It is Mr. Thingum Bob
            said so, and Mr. Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum
            Bob did that. But I am meek and expire with an humble
            heart. After all, what is it?--this indescribable something
             which men will persist in terming "genius?" I agree with
            
            <span class="person" id="gllbuffon">Buffon</span>--with 
            <span class="person" id="whogarth">Hogarth</span>--it is but diligence after all.
         </p>
         
         <p>Look at me!--how I labored--how I toiled--how I wrote!
            Ye Gods, did I not write? I knew not the word "ease."
            By day I adhered to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I
            consumed the midnight oil. You should have seen me-you should. I leaned to the right. I leaned to the left. I
            sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon end. I sat tete
            baissee, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,) bowing my head
             
            close to the alabaster page. And, through all, I--wrote.
            Through joy and through sorrow, I--wrote. Through hunger and through thirst, I--wrote. Through good report and 
            through ill report, I--wrote. Through sunshine and through 
            moonshine, I--wrote. What I wrote it is unnecessary to 
            say. The style!--that was the thing. I caught it from 
            Fatquack--whizz!--fizz!--and I am giving you a specimen
            of it now.

            <p>A Chaunt of Life and other Poems, with Sketches &amp; Essays.
               By Rev. 
               <span class="person" id="rhoyt">Ralph Hoyt</span>. In Six Parts. Part II. New York: 
               Le Roy and Hoyt.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Publishers' Advertisement to this beautiful volume informs us that "the first part was very kindly received by the 
               reading public and the press, but a considerable number of
               elegantly bound copies being destroyed by fire, the author
               became embarrassed and unable to proceed"--until aided or
               urged to do so, we presume, by the present publishers. It
               would have been, indeed, a great pity to abandon an enterprise so flatteringly commenced. We shall look with interest for the completion of the series.
            </p>
            
            <p>Part II. contains the second Canto of a very fine poem,
               "The Chaunt of Life." From the first stanza we quote the
               three remarkably beautiful lines:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Slow droop the eyelids of the drowsy day;
               
               <br></br>All weary life and every heart oppressed,
               
               <br></br>In soothing slumber now may sink to rest.
            </div>
            
            <p>The fourth and fifth stanzas are very noble:--</p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Give me to love my fellow, and in love,
               
               <br></br>If with none other grace to chaunt my strain,
               
               <br></br>Sweet key-note of soft; cadences above,
               
               <br></br>Sole star of solace in life's night of pain.
               
               <br></br>Chief gem of Eden, fractured in that fall
               
               <br></br>That ruined two fond hearts, and tarnished all!
               
               <br></br>Redeemer! be thy kindly spirit mine;
               
               <br></br>That pearl of Paradise to me restore,
               
               <br></br>Pure, fervent, fearless, lasting, love divine,
               
               <br></br>Profound as ocean, broad as sea and shore.
               
               <br></br>While Man I sing, free, subject, and supreme,
               
               <br></br>O!	for a soul, as ample as the theme!
               
               <br></br>Sad prelude I have sung, by Sorrow led
               
               <br></br>Along the mournful shades that own her sway,
               
               <br></br>Where, Ay a stream that weeping eyes have shed,
               
               <br></br>Low chaunted I my melancholy lay,
               
               <br></br>In pensive concord with the sootheless wail
               
               <br></br>Of sighing wanderers in that lonely vale.
               
               <br></br>Ah, chide not those whose wo seems hard to bear,
               
               <br></br>The heart must hover where its treasures sleep;
               
               <br></br>I saw the great, the wise, the gifted there.
               
               <br></br>With humbler multitudes compelled to weep;
               
               <br></br>No penury, no wealth commands relief!
               
               <br></br>No Serf, no Sovereign in the realms of grief!
            </div>
            
            <p>We Italicise two passages, however, for their defects, and
               not for their merits. We can conceive that a gem may be
               "fractured in a fall" and even (imperfectly) that in so falling
               it may "ruin two fond hearts", but how it can "tarnish all"
               or anything, in so falling, does not appear. The stream of
               tears is in shockingly bad taste. But the stately and pensive
               thought and well-sustained modulation of the stanzas amply
               redeem these demerits.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="rhoyt">Hoyt</span> is occasionally halting in his metre, although
               rarely or ever in his rhythm. In stanza VIII. a foot is missng in the fifth line:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Rise! with heroic strength be strong.
            </div>
            
            <p>In stanza XII. there is a superfluous foot in the second line:</p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Ecbatana and Babylon and Tyre remote--
            </div>
            
            <p>although the stanza as a whole is particularly sonorous and
               Miltonic.
            </p>
            
            <p>The poem entitled "Old" has so many rare and peculiar
               excellences, that we shall venture to copy it in full. It will
               forcibly remind our readers of Mr. Durand's exquisite picture
               "An Old Man's Recollections"--although between poem and
               painting there is nothing more than a perfectly admissible
               similarity. The quaintness is, in our opinion, to be defended
               as a legitimate effect, conferring high pleasure upon a numerous and cultivated class of minds. In his continuous and
               absolutely uniform repetition of the first line in the last of
               each stanza, he has by much exceeded the legitimate limits
               of the quaint, and impinged upon the simply ludicrous. The
               poem, nevertheless, abounds in lofty merit, and has, in especial, some exquisite passages of pathos and of imagination.
               We Italicise some of these.

            OLD.
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>By the way-side, on a mossy stone
               
               <br></br>Sat a hoary pilgrim sadly musing;
               
               <br></br>Oft I marked him sitting there alone,
               
               <br></br>All the landscape like a page perusing;
               
               <br></br>Poor, unknown,
               
               <br></br>By the way-side, on a mossy stone.
               
               <br></br>Buckled knee and shoe, and broad-rimmed hat,
               
               <br></br>Coat as ancient as the form 'twas folding,
               
               <br></br>Silver buttons, queue, and crimped cravat,
               
               <br></br>Oaken staff, his feeble hand upholding,
               
               <br></br>There he sat!
               
               <br></br>Buckled knee and shoe, and broad-rimmed hat.
               
               <br></br>Seemed it pitiful he should sit there.
               
               <br></br>No one sympathizing, no one heeding,
               
               <br></br>None to love him for his thin grey hair,
               
               <br></br>And the furrows all so mutely pleading,
               
               <br></br>Age, and care;
               
               <br></br>Seemed it pitiful he should sit there.
               
               <br></br>It was summer, and we went to school.
               
               <br></br>Dapper country lads and little maidens,
               
               <br></br>Taught the motto of the "Dunce's Stool,'i
               
               <br></br>Its grave import still my fancy ladens,
               
               <br></br>"Here's a FOOL!"
               
               <br></br>It was summer, and we went to school.
               
               <br></br>When the stranger seemed to mark our play,
               
               <br></br>(Some of us were joyous, some sad-hearted,
               
               <br></br>I remember well,--too well,--that day!)
               
               <br></br>Oftentimes the tears unbidden started,--
               
               <br></br>Would not stay!
               
               <br></br>When the stranger seemed to mark our play.
               
               <br></br>One sweet spirit broke the silent spell--
               
               <br></br>Ah!to me her name was always heaven
               
               <br></br>She besought him all his grief to tell,--
               
               <br></br>(I was then thirteen, and she eleven,)
               
               <br></br>Isabel!
               
               <br></br>One sweet spirit broke the silent spell.
               
               <br></br>Angel, said he sadly, I am old;
               
               <br></br>Earthly hope no longer hath a morrow,
               
               <br></br>Yet why I sit here thou shall soon be told,
               
               <br></br>Then his eye betrayed a pearl of sorrow,--
               
               <br></br>Down it rolled!
               
               <br></br>Angel, said he sadly, I am old!
               
               <br></br>I have tottered here to look once more
               
               <br></br>On the pleasant scene where I delighted
               
               <br></br>In the careless, happy days of yore,
               
               <br></br>Ere the garden of my heart was blighted--
               
               <br></br>To the core!
               
               <br></br>I have tottered here to look once more!
                
               
               <br></br>All the picture now to me how dear!
               
               <br></br>E'en this gray old rock where I am seated,
               
               <br></br>Is a jewel worth a journey here;
               
               <br></br>Ah, that such a scene must be completed
               
               <br></br>With a tear!
               
               <br></br>All the picture now to me how dear!
               
               <br></br>Old stone School-House!--it is still the same!
               
               <br></br>There's the very step so oft I mounted;
               
               <br></br>There's the window creaking in its frame,
               
               <br></br>And the notches that I cut and counted
               
               <br></br>For the game;
               
               <br></br>Old stone School-House!--it is still the same!
               
               <br></br>In the cottage, yonder, I was born:
               
               <br></br>Long my happy home--that humble dwelling;
               
               <br></br>There the fields of clover, wheat, and corn,
               
               <br></br>There the spring, with limpid nectar swelling;
               
               <br></br>Ah, Forlorn!--
               
               <br></br>In the cottage, yonder, I was born.
               
               <br></br>Those two gate-way sycamores you see,
               
               <br></br>Then were planted, just so far asunder
               
               <br></br>That long well-pole from the path to free,
               
               <br></br>And the wagon to pass safely under
               
               <br></br>Ninety-three
               
               <br></br>Those two gate-way sycamores you see?
               
               <br></br>There's the orchard where we used to climb
               
               <br></br>When my mates and I were boys together,
               
               <br></br>Thinking nothing of the flight of lime,
               
               <br></br>Fearing nought but work and rainy weather;
               
               <br></br>Past its prime!
               
               <br></br>There's the orchard where we used to climb!
               
               <br></br>There, the rude, three-cornered chestnut rails,
               
               <br></br>Round the pasture where the flocks were grazing,
               
               <br></br>Where so sly, I used to watch for quails
               
               <br></br>In the crops of buckwheat we were raising,--
               
               <br></br>Traps and trails,--
               
               <br></br>There, the rude, three-cornered chesnut rails.
               
               <br></br>There's the mill that ground our yellow grain;
               
               <br></br>Pond, and river still serenely flowing;
               
               <br></br>Cot, there nestling in the shaded lane,
               
               <br></br>Where the lily of my heart was blowing,--
               
               <br></br>Mary Jane!
               
               <br></br>There's the mill that ground our yellow grain!
               
               <br></br>There's the gate on which I used to swing,
               
               <br></br>Brook and bridge, and barn, and old red stable;
               
               <br></br>But alas! the morn shall no more bring
               
               <br></br>That dear group around my father's table;
               
               <br></br>Taken wing!
               
               <br></br>There's the gate on which I used to swing!
               
               <br></br>I am fleeing!--all I loved are fled;
               
               <br></br>Yon green meadow was our place for playing;
               
               <br></br>That old tree can tell of sweet things said,
               
               <br></br>When around it Jane and I were straying;--
               
               <br></br>She is dead!
               
               <br></br>I am fleeing!--all I loved are fled!
               
               <br></br>Yon white spire--a pencil on the sky.
               
               <br></br>Tracing silently life's changeful story,
               
               <br></br>So familiar to my dim old eye,
               
               <br></br>Points me to seven that are now in glory
               
               <br></br>There on high
               
               <br></br>Yon white spire, a pencil on the sky!
               
               <br></br>Oft the aisle of that old church we trod,
               
               <br></br>Guided thither by an angel mother;
               
               <br></br>Now she sleeps beneath its sacred sod,--
               
               <br></br>Sire and sisters, and my little brother--
               
               <br></br>Gone to God!
               
               <br></br>Oft the aisle of that old church we trod!
               
               <br></br>There I heard of Wisdom's pleasant ways,
               
               <br></br>Bless the holy lesson!--but, ah, never
               
               <br></br>Shall I hear again those songs of praise,
               
               <br></br>Those sweet voices,--silent now forever!
               
               <br></br>Peaceful days!
               
               <br></br>There I heard of Wisdom's pleasant ways.
               
               <br></br>There my Mary blest me with her hand,
               
               <br></br>When our soul drank in the nuptial blessing,
               
               <br></br>Ere she hastened to the spirit-land;
               
               <br></br>Yonder turf her gentle bosom pressing:
               
               <br></br>Broken band!
               
               <br></br>There my Mary blest me with her hand.
               
               <br></br>I have come to see that grave once more,
               
               <br></br>And the sacred place where we delighted,
               
               <br></br>Where we worshipped in the days of yore,
               
               <br></br>Ere the garden of my heart was blighted
               
               <br></br>To the core!
               
               <br></br>I have come to see that grave once more.
               
               <br></br>Angel, said he, sadly, I am old!
               
               <br></br>Earthly hope no longer hath a morrow;
               
               <br></br>Now why I sit here thou hast been told;
               
               <br></br>In his eye another pearl of sorrow,--
               
               <br></br>Down it rolled!
               
               <br></br>Angel, said he, sadly, I am old!
               
               <br></br>By the wayside, on a mossy stone,
               
               <br></br>Sat the hoary pilgrim, sadly musing;
               
               <br></br>Still I marked him sitting there alone,
               
               <br></br>All the landscape, like a page perusing;
               
               <br></br>Poor, unknown,
               
               <br></br>By the way-side, on a mossy stone!
            </div>
            
            <p>The stanza commencing "Buckled knee and shoe," &amp;c.
               puts us somewhat too forcibly in mind of 
               <span class="person" id="owholmes">Oliver Wendell
                  Holmes
               </span>' "Old Man." The exclamation "Ninety-Three!"
               introduced, as it is, independently of the observations which
               surround it, must be regarded as one of the happiest instances either of refined art or of natural pathos.
            </p>
            
            <p>"The stanza beginning "Yon white spire" cannot be too
               warmly commended.
            </p>
            
            <p>"New" is a pendant to "Old," but its artificiality of construction is even more displeasingly apparent. We quote
               one or two sweet passages:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Ah, June can only charm her eyes
               
               <br></br>With flowers of paradisial dyes
               
               <br></br>And azure skies.
            </div>
            
            <p>This, however, should read, "Ah, only June," &amp;c.</p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>The glowing tranquil summertime;
               
               <br></br>The summertime;
               
               <br></br>Too listless in a maiden's prime;
               
               <br></br>Dull melancholy pantomime!
               
               <br></br>Oh for a gay autumnal clime!

               <br></br>The summertime.
               
               <br></br>Love nestles in that gentle breast--
               
               <br></br>That gentle breast.
               
               <br></br>Ah Love will never let it rest--

               <br></br>Ah Love will never let it rest--
               
               <br></br>That gentle breast.'

            <p>"Boemus" is the concluding poem of the volume, and is
               marked by the same peculiarities of metre--peculiarities,
               however, which, in a composition such as this, must be considered out of place. We conclude our review with the quotation of a very spirited stanza--a stanza which would do no
               discredit to Campbell, and is much in his vein:

            <p>FRENCH OPERA--PARK THEATRE.--The intense heat of the
               weather has been sadly injurious to the success of the various theatres, keeping away hundreds who would otherwise
               have visited such places of amusement.
            </p>
            
            <p>La Juive has been represented once, but we were unable
               to attend. It was, however, we understand, very successful,
               having been produced on a scale of the greatest magnificence.
               Should it be again performed, we will describe it fully.
            </p>
            
            <p>La Fille du Regiment was produced last week. If Donizetti had never written any thing but La Fille du Regiment
               and L'E'isir d'Amore, his name would surely be preserved
               for posterity. There are many beauties of high character in
               all his serious operas, but he is never so thoroughly at home
               as in the works of lighter character. Throughout both the
               operas mentioned there is a continued flow of delicious melody, varied and original in its character; the concerted pieces also exhibit an unusual degree of excellence, and the instrumentation is of a higher order of merit, being more richly
               and variously harmonized. La Fille du Regiment is truly
               French. Donizetti has most happily imitated the peculiarity
               of the school. It lacks however the quaintness of Auber,
               and sometimes the Italian school intrudes, as in the lovely
               romance, "Il faut partir," sung by Marie; but as a whole it
               is an admirable conception, worked out with masterly skill.
            </p>
            
            <p>The cast was as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="ab">Marie (La Fille du Regiment) . . . M'lle Calve.
               
               <br></br>Marchioness de Berkenfeldt .... M'me Mathieu.
               
               <br></br>Ten o, a Tyrolinn peasant........M. Buscher.
               
               <br></br>Sulpice, a sergeant..............M. Bernard.
               
               <br></br>Hortensius, a steward............M. Mathieu.
            </div>
            
            <p>M'lle Calve personated La Fille most admirably. Her
               manner was that of a pelted child of rude but chivalric men
               --a happy mixture of playful boldness and shrinking maiden
               modesty. In all that M'lle Calve does, she is a true woman
               --whether as the playful coquette, teasing but tender, wilful to commit a fault, but eager and earnest to sue for forgiveness; or as the young girl, whose nature, full of the
               stronger and deeper emotions, gratitude and affection for her
               protectors, and love for one who loves her fondly in return;
               whether as the wild and light-hearted vivandiere, or as the
               titled lady--Mile Calve is the true woman in all, faithful to
               life in every phase of the character.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of her singing we can truly say, that in the character of
               Marie she exhibits more excellence than in any other character she has appeared in. Her execution of "Il faut partir" was a beautiful exhibition of deep, tender, and regretful
               feeling. "Chacun le sait" was admirable for its point and
               finish, and the enthusiasm with which she gave "Salut a la
               France," could only be equalled by the reception it met with
               from the audience. She dressed the part with her usual
               taste,--which is perfection. We hope to see her repeat this
               character.
            </p>
            
            <p>Madame Mathieu as the Marchioness Berkenfield, elicited
               general approbation. Her acting and singing in the trio,
               "Le jour naissait," was not to be surpassed; while in the
               graver portions of the character she was equally good. Her
               second dress was in truth a most admirable costume.
            </p>
            
            <p>M. Coeuriot, who was to have played Tonio, continuing
                
               seriously indisposed, M. Buscher, at two days' notice, had to
               undertake the part. He acquitted himself very creditably, 
               His voice is not quite equal to the music, although it is certain that he would have appeared to much greater advantage had he been more familiar with the music.
            </p>
            
            <p>M. Bernard, as the old Sergeant, is deserving of our warmest commendation. Not for one moment did he forget the 
               character of the Old Soldier. It was a true picture from the 
               beginning to the end. The sternness of the old warrior, the
               tender affection for La Fille, and the quiet quizzing of the
               peculiarities of the antiquated Marchioness, each received at
               his hands full justice. His singing was correctly and artistically rendered.
            </p>
            
            <p>The acting of M. Mathieu as the Steward, was an exquisite piece of quiet humour.</p>
            
            <p>The chorusses were well executed, although scarcely equal
               to some former performances.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Band displayed its usual excellence. In the finale to
               the second act, however, where the short fugue passage occurs, there was much obscurity among the stringed instruments, but M. Prevost ably retrieved the error. We must
               particularly compliment M. Ribas for his exquisite performance upon the "Chor Anglaise" in Marie's song, "Il faut
               partir"; also the first violoncellist for his obligato accompaniment in the second act.

            <p>OPENING OF THE ORGAN FOR TRINITY CHURCH, NEW HAVEN.--We were present at Mr. Erben's Factory, Centrestreet, on the occasion of the exhibition of an organ built for
               the above church.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following is a statement of the construction, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
            
            <p>The organ is contained in a splendid gothic case of black
               walnut. It has two complete sets of keys and two octaves of
               pedals.

            </div>
            
            <p>It will be seen by this statement that the organ, although
               it is by no means a large instrument, possesses considerable 
               power; indeed, for its size, it possesses extraordinary power. 
               A coupling movement for the Great Organ and Swell, which 
               goes as low as C below Fiddle G, gives great power to the
               instrument and enriches the Great Organ exceedingly, when
               used either full or in part. The pedals down to 16 foot C, are
               very good, speaking almost immediately, and being equal
               throughout.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Reed Stops are admirable; we must particularize the
               exceeding beauty and delicacy of the Hautboy in the Swell,
               and of the rough, full, and truly characteristic quality of the
               trumpet in the same department, showing great improvement in a few years in these particular stops. The Flute is
               in the Great Organ, and is very mellow, soft and delicate. It
               can be used as a solo stop with more convenience and better
               effect than if it were in the Swell. Organ builders should
               bear this in mind, and never put the Flute Stop in any other
               than the Great Organ or Choir.
            </p>
            
            <p>To the Diapasons generally we must award unqualified
               praise; they are exceedingly heavy and rich. The Pedals
               may be coupled either with the Great Organ or Swell, or both.
               The omission of Composition Pedals is, however, much to be
               regretted, as they so greatly facilitate the labor of the organist, in the rapid change of stops necessary to produce striking
               effects.
            </p>
            
            <p>Shortly after we went in, Mr. W. A. King, Organist of St.
               Peter's Church, sat down to the organ. Mr. King is acknowledged to be the most eminently capable man of all men in
               the country, to show off an organ, of whatever size, to the
               greatest advantage. As an extemporaneous player, we have
               not met his equal on this continent; his fancy is brilliant,
               --his thoughts of beauty succeed each other in rapid succession; he handles his subject with much clearness; these
               qualifications, combined with his perfect knowledge of the
               various and beautiful combinations, and his complete mastery
               over the King of Instruments, have gained for him his high
               and well-earned reputation. His performance on this occasion was extemporaneous; in it he introduced several beautiful airs from Robert Le Diable. So masterly was his performance--so various and so orchestral was his treatment of his
               themes, that he kept a very miscellaneous audience rapt and
               silent for something more than half an hour--the hightest tribute that could be paid to his genius.
            </p>
            
            <p>Altogether, we were much delighted with the exhibition,
               and we consider that the congregation of Trinity Church, N.
               H., cannot fail to be truly gratified with their purchase.

               by Herman S. Saroni.
            </p>
            
            <p>All the above pieces are published by John F. Nunn, 240
               Broadway.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first song is in E minor, common time. It is constructed upon the simplest form of English ballads. The first eight
               bars are in E minor; it then changes for a brief period into C
               minor, returning again to the original key. The melody is
               exceedingly plaintive and expressive, and, although the
               closes are somewhat hackneyed and common-place, yet the
               accompaniments are so full and so judiciously used they redeem and dignify the character of the song. A false relation
               occurs in the twelfth bar of each verse, where the right hand
               accompaniment and the voice descend in seconds, making a
               most inharmonious effect. A false accent is also given in
               the third verse to the word 'joyously.' The accent falls with
               a minim note upon the penultimate syllabic. This should
               always be avoided in order to preserve the integrity of the
               pronunciation. The poetry is pretty and full of sentiment,
               and is modelled after the style which 
               <span class="person" id="thbayly">Haynes Bayley</span> rendered so popular.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is got out in excellent style.</p>
            
            <p>The second song is by far the most melodious composition
               we have seen from Mr. Saroni's pen. It is truly a gushing
               forth of feeling and sensibility. A right hearty "Welcome
               to his Sister" was evidently the feeling nearest to his heart,
               and he has expressed it with singular fidelity. We recommend this song most earnestly to our musical friends. The
               poetry by Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jbphillips">J. B. Phillips</span> is smooth and agreeable, and expresses a warm and amiable sensibility. The third song is
               in C minor, 3-4 time. Its character is mournful to a painful
               degree. The principal subject is to be found in the symphony,
               and is given to the left hand. It is well carried out through
                
               the song, and imparts to it a sad and reflective lone, which
               forcibly impresses the hearer. This song has not the stamp
               of genuineness so strongly marked as the second under
               notice, but it is a good song.
            </p>
            
            <p>All these songs are got out in admirable style by J. F.
               Nunns, 240 Broadway. Our musical friends would do well
               to look them through.

         <p>At Niblo's, Mrs. Mowatt is still delighting large, fashionable, and very intellectual audiences, who testify their sympathy with the woman, not less than their approbation of the
            actress, by the most profound and respectful attention.
         </p>
         
         <p>Last week we had seen the fair debutante only in Pauline,
            but we have since been charmed with her delineations of Juliana, in "The Honeymoon," and Lucy Ashton, in "The Bride
            of Lammermoor." The former of these plays has very little
            to recommend it--especially to Mrs. Mowatt. Its leading
            incident is grossly absurd. A duke (Aranza,) wedding, in his
            character of duke, a haughty gentlewoman (Juliana) makes
            her believe, after marriage, that he is not only a peasant, but
            more entirely brutal and disgusting than peasant ever yet
            was. He maltreats her in almost every way--sneers at her-insists upon her standing up in his presence and attending his
            friends in the capacity of a slave--locks her up in her chamber--refuses her communication with her parents--does every
            thing in short but strike her--and makes his brutality only
            the more odious by putting on, at one point, the airs of a man
            of honor--drawing down the rapturous approbation of the
            audience by certain rhodomontade to the effect that
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>"Whoever lays his hand upon a woman,
            
            <br></br>Save in the way of kindness, is a villain
            
            <br></br>Whom't were base flattery to call a coward."
         </div>
         
         <p>--as if the severest personal chastisement he could have inflicted would not have been less cowardly than his other
            bestial affronts to her dignity and honor. But all this would
            be nothing, if we were not required to believe that, by such
            conduct, the duke finally subdues the haughty temper of his
            wife, and actually secures her most passionate love! These
            things are so grossly unnatural as to destroy all the verisimilitude of the play--and the total irrelevancy of the under-plots
            confirm the difficulty and strengthen the disgust. "The
            Honeymoon," in short, is a wretched affair, which has been
            unluckily saved to the stage (for its sins) by a number of sparkling points well adapted to tell with audiences too ill-cultivated to estimate merit otherwise than in detail--and especially by a quality which, so far from saving it, should have
            secured its instant condemnation--we mean its palpable plagiarism of all the worst demerits of "The Taming of the
            Shrew."
         </p>
         
         <p>In Juliana--because Juliana is a role altogether out of nature--we did not expect Mrs. Mowatt to do much--for not
            much is there for any one to do. So far as a gracefully dashing demeanour goes, she nevertheless accomplished something--and
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>Oh what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
            
            <br></br>In the contempt and anger of her lip!
         </div>
         
         <p>We were delighted, however, to find her announced as
            Lucy in "The Bride of Lammermoor," for our remembrances of this opera were connected only with the music of Bellini and the glowing romance of Scott. If, in all the literature of fiction, there is a character for which Mrs. Mowatt is
            peculiarly adapted, it is the Lucy Ashton of the original
            "Bride of Lammermoor." If the authoress of "Fashion"
            knew her own strength, she would confine herself, nearly altogether, to the depicting in letters, as well as on the stage,
            the more gentle sentiments and the most profound passions.
            Her sympathy with the latter is evidently intense. In the utterance of the truly generous--of the really noble--of the unaffectedly passionate--we see her bosom heave--her cheek
            grow pale--her limbs tremble--her chiselled lip quiver--and
            Nature's own tear rush impetuously to the eye. Now it is
            this freshness of the heart which will provide for her the
            greenest laurels. It is this enthusiasm--this well of deep
            feeling--which should be made to prove to her an exhaustless
            source of fame! As actress, it is to her a mine of wealth-worth all the dawdling instructions in the world. Mrs.
            Mowatt, as she now stands, is quite as able to give lessons in
            stage routine to any actor or actress in America, as is any
            actor or actress to give lessons to her. Let her throw all
            support to the winds--trust proudly to her own grace of manner--her own sense of art--her own rich and natural elocution--and let her be assured that these qualities, as she now
            possesses them, are all sufficient, when considered simply as
            the means by which the great end of natural acting is to be
            consummated--as the mere instruments by which she may
            effectively and unimpededly lay bare to the audience the
            movements of her own passionate heart.
         </p>
         
         <p>Feeling this--being well assured, from first seeing Mrs.
            Mowatt as Pauline, that her forte lay in the depicting of
            passion, we were anxious to see her in Juliet (a part which
            will yet render her immortal) and were delighted when we
            saw her announced for Lucy Ashton. But alas! it was
             Scott's Lucy and not the Opera Lucy of which we dreamed.
            The play, as we saw it on Tuesday, is miserably ineffective
            --and the remembrance of that most passionate and romantic of novels, will intrude itself to render the defects of the
            dramatization more palpable. We even fancied that we
             could perceive the depressing influence of this remembrance
            in the countenance of Mrs. Mowatt. With a bosom full of
            emotion, she seemed to suffer from the total insufficiency of
            the words of the dramatist, to give utterance to her thought.
            But what was to be done was done to admiration. The
            actress lost no opportunity. The appeal to the mother was
            very noble acting. The signing of the contract, and the wild
            shriek at the sudden entrance of Edgar, would have done
            honor to any one. The apathetic and mute despair at the
            conclusion of the play, and during the interview with Ravenswood in the mother's presence--the dumb uncomprehending
            wretchedness--the half-conscious rendering up of the broken
            gold--the laboring anxiety for the relief of words--the final
            maddening confession, heart-breaking, and death in the
            lover's arms--were the teachings not of Mr. Crisp, but of
            Nature herself--speaking in tones that could not be misunderstood. The audience grew pale, and were betrayed into
            silence and tears--and if any one went away sneering that
            night, it is at least quite certain that he felt ashamed of the
            sneer.

               Joseph Bonapate collected together at Bordentown, will not

            <p>THE NEW YORK HERALD vs. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF
               FINE ARTS.--While defending the National Academy against
               the ill-judged remarks, false accusations, and grossly ignorant misstatements which appeared in the Herald a short
               time since, we wish it to be distinctly understood that we
               are no partisans of the Academy or its supporters. What
               we have done is simply an act of common justice to the Academy; at the same time it is an act of duty imperative on us
               to endeavor to disabuse the public mind of any false impressions which the article in the Herald was calculated to convey.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following quotations from the Herald will clearly
               prove the utter ignorance of the writer in question, of all that
               appertains to the National Academy, its constitution, and
               the intention of its establishment.
            </p>
            
            <p>National Academy of Design.--This institution has now closed its
               exhibition for the season, and one or two remarks in review may be
               made with propriety. One of these applies to the character of the
               works, and on this topic we have to say, that little improvement has
               been observable in the pictures over those of former seasons. This
               stationary state of the exhibition is a matter of regret, and totally at
               variance with the specific end and object of the association, which are
               by introducing to public notice, and awards of premiums to excellence,
               to develop latent talent, encourage genius, and foster a true taste. To
               accomplish this, no person who reads the discourses of Sir 
               <span class="person" id="jreynolds">Joshua
                  Reynolds
               </span>, and other standard writings on the Fine Arts, can overlook
               the essential importance of high models to the education of the artist.
               This admitted, the inference is obvious, that for the improvement of
               students at least, a few works of a high order of excellence would be
               of infinitely more service than the most extensive accumulations of
               mediocre or worthless pictures, such as compose the major part of
               those displayed every season by the Academy of Design.
            </p>
            
            <p>To the first remark we would simply reply that the rooms
               of the Academy were open as usual for the works of every
               artist, but if the artists will not improve from year to year,
               surely the Council of the Academy is not to be blamed. In
               the next place, the object of the institution is not to award
               premiums, but simply to instruct young students, and to offer
               them when sufficiently advanced, and other artists, a medium
               through which their works may be presented to the public.
               The Academy offers no premium to the exhibitor. The
               exhibition is composed of the works of artists and not of pupils. When an artist ceases to be a pupil, he ceases to acknowledge the competency if any tribunal to judge of his
               works short of that of public opinion. To the award of that
               tribunal he cheerfully submits, and the prize he contends for
               is Fame.
            </p>
            
            <p>The introduction of Sir 
               <span class="person" id="jreynolds">Joshua Reynolds</span>' name would
               have much weight, did the opinions quoted from him bear
               any relation to the subject in question. The accumulation
               of valuable pictures is the province of the directors of a
               National Gallery, which gallery should be opened, as in
               England, France, &amp;c. certain days in the week, for the study
               of the pupils of the National Academy.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Another fault attributable to it is the mode of its management,
               which we are sorry to say does not betray liberality, or solicitude for
               the character of the body. Cliques are bad enough, and detestable
               under any circumstances; but to allow their influence over an institution avowedly dedicated to one or more of the Fine Arts, smells of
               sacrilege. What do the "Council" then say to the charge against the
               composition of the body--that it is made up of a coterie of painters, to
               the exclusion of those who are not--that they practise a system of favoritism, giving prominence often to wretched daubs, because the authors have influence with them, and consigning to neglect works of
               merit or of promise, for reasons best known to themselves, and the
               sufferers from their partiality."
            </p>
            
            <p>What defence can we make to the terrible charge that
               "artists," and only artists, presume to manage an institution
               devoted to instruction in the arts? We will merely inquire
                if persons ignorant of music are more competent to teach
                than musicians?--if one who never read a law book is more
                capable to defend a cause than a practised lawyer? When
                these questions are answered in the affirmative universally,
                this charge will have some weight, but until then we trust
               that every professional association will be managed by professional men.

            <p>The charge of unfairness in the conduct of the hanging
               committee, scarcely needs a reply. Their task is a most difficult and a most unthankful one. That they are accused of
               unfairness is not to us a matter of surprise--had they not
               been so accused would indeed have been surprising, for what
               artist that ever exhibited but believed his works (however
               wretched) deserving of the very best place upon the walls.
               This charge is too frivolous to require further comment.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Once more, wo reproach the Council of the Academy of Design
               With giving a sordid and gravelling character to their policy. They
               do not seem to be aware that money making is not the object of the
               institution, or are ignorant of the truth that the gain of pence and the
               acquisition of taste and artistical skill, have no connection with--no
               affinity for each other. Making money is not the end to be sought in
               these exhibitions, and yet there is good ground for binning the managers for a departure from this truth. Instead of concocting narrow
               plans for gain, it is the office of the managers to disburse all the funds
               they are able in patronising and encouraging merit without favor or
               partiality; and one mode of doing so would be the establishment of a
               Drawing School, which has been too long neglected. We want to see
               this Academy of Design with an "odor of nationality about it," and
               to have that it must not be narrow, sordid, or illiberal, but comprehensive in its objects, simple in its operations, and elevated in its motives
               --then it will be what it professes to be, an American Academy of
               Design."
            </p>
            
            <p>To this last charge of "sordid and grovelling policy" we
               have only to oppose facts. Not one single cent of the money
               received from the public exhibition has ever been appropriated to the personal uses of the members of the Academy.
               The whole of such proceeds has been expended in sustaining
               the institution, as the reports will triumphantly show.
            </p>
            
            <p>The last two sentences of the Herald's sagacious article
               cap the climax of the writer's incredible ignorance, and
               shameless assurance. Has the man been sleeping for the
               last twenty years? or were his statements merely wilful and
               malicious slanders, penned with the intention to prejudice
               the public against the National Academy? We are compelled to believe the latter suggestion, arguing from the illiberal tone of the article throughout. This person actually
               asks the Council of the National Academy why they do not
               establish a drawing academy? Why, such a school has been
               in existence for the last twenty years! It was established
               by and supported always from the funds of the Academy.
               It is open several months in the winter season for students-free of expense. Some of the finest casts, from the antique,
               in the world, are at the service of the students. In fact the
               number of classical models in the school is very great. Besides statuary the student has the advantage of drawing
               from the life figure; to procure which is a heavy tax upon
               the funds of the society. These advantages are freely offered, gratuitously, to young persons desirous of studying the
               art, and the number of pupils to this school, collected from
               all parts of the country, has been sixty and upwards every
               year. Does this smack of "sordid and grovelling policy"?
               Is this the conduct of narrow-minded or illiberal men? If
               they desired to keep the entire public patronage, why should
               they voluntarily instruct so large a number of young men,
                
               some of whom might naturally be expected to deprive them
               of some portion of that patronage, when they might if they
               choose appropriate that money to themselves, which is now
               as it were the means of existence and fume to hundreds.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Academy has its faults, but there is so much that is
               excellent in it that we have thought it proper to put the public in possession of the facts. In our future numbers we
               shall make the public acquainted with the history of this society and the benefits it has conferred upon the artist in this
               country.

         <p>The object of this most praiseworthy attempt is to give
            the convict a fair chance for re-commencing life, on equal
            terms with those amongst whom he finds him or herself, when
            released from confinement. The idea is one capable of the
            best results, if fairly carried out; which we feel assured it
            will be, when intrusted to such hands as it appears naturally
            to have fallen into. No public reform appears to us so loudly to be called for, or with so much justice, as that which
            would ameliorate the condition of the prisoners in or cut of
            jail: and, perhaps, from the existing state of things, it is
            even more incumbent upon society to help him from getting
            into prison, than in the first instance even to send him there.
            When we consider the stigma attached to the fact of ever
            having been confined in a prison, (whether justly or unjustly);
            that it too often casts a blight upon a man's character and
            prospects, from which he rarely recovers: and then onlyfrom admirable resolution, patience, and a most uncommon
            force of mind and character: it is a most solemn prompting
            of the conscience that commands us to treat the victim of
            folly, of ignorance, or of crime, with at least the same tolerant spirit, the same equal justice which we ourselves would
            hope for, in the same situation.
         </p>
         
         <p>The fact really is, that very many are obliged to 'commit'
            themselves, or perish by the bleak freezing of neglect;' that
            to obtain a shelter and food to sustain life, they must e'en
            return to the hated jail.
         </p>
         
         <p>That a small number, like Mr. Rathbun of Buffalo, whom
            we have ever admired for his enterprise and public spirit:
            whom we have thought a much more eminent man than
            many of his fellow speculators and tempters to doubtful
            schemes of profit; whose offence considered not as a selfish
            crime, but as springing from a desire to advance the public
            interests, and to interweave his name (a laudable ambition)
            with his favorite town, we might almost pardon as venial,
            were not justice the most exacting of all virtues--that not a
            few like him, by dint of energy, the salient spring of self-confidence, and great activity of mind, can occasionally recover
            lost ground, perhaps become better and alter many thereby,
            is no argument against a society like the present, whose aim
            is to help the vast majority, who are not able to help themselves.

         <p>Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="npwillis">Willis</span>.--Nothig for a long time has given us so
            true a pleasure as to learn that this distinguished gentleman
            has entirely recovered his health. He is now busily at work
            --and has commenced his anxiously expected Letters for
            The Mirror"--four of them having been already received.
            Among all our men of literature there is not one whose laurels have been more nobly earned than have been those of
            Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="npwillis">Willis</span>. The country has a right to be proud of him--
            and is.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is extraordinary, says Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="npwillis">W.</span> in one of his late letters,
            how little the English change! Regent-street, after four or
            five years, is exactly what Regent-street was. The men
            have the same light cravats, coats too small, overbrushed
            whiskers, and look of being excessively washed. The carriages and horses exactly the same. The cheap shops have
            the same placard of "Selling Off" in their broad windows.
            The blind beggars tell the same story, and are led by the
            same dogs: but what is stranger than all this sameness is,
            that the ladies look the same! The fashions have perhaps
            changed--in the milliner's shops! But the Englishing that
            is done to French bonnets after they are bought, or the En
            glish way in which they are worn, overpowers the novelty,
            and gives the fair occupants of the splendid carriages of London the very same look they had ten years ago.
         </p>
         
         <p>Still, there are some slight differences observable in the
            street, and among others, I observe that the economical private carriage called a "Brougham," is very common. These
            are low cabs, holding two or four persons, with a driver, and
            perhaps a footman in livery on the outside seat, and one
            horse seems to do the work as well as two. This fashion
            would be well introduced into New York--that is so say, if
            our city is ever to be well enough paved to make a drive any
            thing but a dire necessity. The paving of London is really
            most admirable. Vast city as it is, the streets are as smooth
            as a floor all over it, and to ride is indeed a luxury. The
            breack-neck, hat-jamming and dislocating jolts of Broadway
            must seem to English judgment an inexcusable stain on our
            public spirit. And, Apropos of paving--the wooden pavement seems to be entirely out of favor. Regent street is laid
            in wooden blocks, and in wet weather (and it rains here some
            part of every day,) it is so slippery that an omnibus which
            has been stopped in going up the street is with difficulty started again. The horses almost always come to their knees,
            thongh the ascent is very slight, and the falls of cart and carriage-horses are occurring continually. Nothing seems to
            "do" like the McAdam pavement, and wherever you find it
            in London, you find it in as perfect order as the floor of
             
            bowling-alley. I see that all heavy vehicles, (by the way)
            are compelled to have very broad wheels, and they rather
            improve the road than spoil it. A law to the same effect
            should be passed in New York, if it ever has a pavement
            worth preserving.

         <p>Madame Laret recently ascended in the balloon from Avignon.
            The balloon dropped into the Rhone, and but for the exertions of a
            young man, who jumped into the river to her rescue, she would
            have been drowned.

            <span class="person" id="bhcapefigne">Capefigne</span>, the
            second volume of which has just appeared, is mueh read and relish.
            ed. Sir Robert Peel is severely dealt with by the author; but the
            best portraits are of Mole, Guizot, and Broglie. It is a work to be
            recommended to all English statesmen. The tragedy of 'Lucrece,'
            which was refused at the Theatre Francais, has produced the author
            60,000 francs.

            "are retiring to their 'Sabine fields,' while the bar and the
            bench are on the wing for Baden, Hambourg, Spa, and Vichy. M.
            Cunou-Gridune is expected at the latter place, and M. Guizot has
            retained his apartments for the month of July. A small revolution
            has been consummated in the musical department of the bath.
            Young Musard has been dethroned, and his sceptre passed to the
            hands of an obscure pretender, M. Strauss, not he of Vienna, but a
            very clever Strauss for all that. The literary men of distinction

               this age needs--a System of Elocution, that presents to the learner
               something tangible; and that combines meaning with beauty, and
               beauty with force.

            <p>SIR --WE WILL THANK YOU TO CAUTION
               the public against a set of imposters who are calling upon our customers, asserting that they are engaged by us in the capacity of agents.
               In several instances they have succeeded in obtaining orders. But
               when the goods are delivered great dissatisfaction has been given by
               the infamous and utterly base imitations. But still persisting that the
               cards are our manufacture, they too often succeed in foisting them
               upon the unsuspecting. We ourselves would strenuously caution the
               said parties that, should they persist after this notice, we will try what
               effect a State Prison will have upon them.

            <div class="head">BERTINI'S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.</div>
            
            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
               yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
               The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
               enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
               through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often
               made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
               a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
               only by the study of such methods us Bertini's that pupils will be enabled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
               musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
               rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
               each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
