        <p>Every year upon the opening of the exhibition, we hear the senseless cry repeated from
          shallow-thoughted writers, "too many portraits—who wants to see men’s faces—why don't they
          give us more historical works?” as if historical pictures were anything but groups of
          men’s faces. A portrait is to a historical composition what a biography is to history, or
          a legend to a novel. For ourselves, we prefer portraiture to historical compositions; and
          we regard a good portrait as the very highest reach of art: and so does the world at large
          regard it. The most valuable paintings in the world are portraits ; they sell at higher
          prices than any other pictures, and give the highest degree of pleasure. Even the gross
          beauties
           of Rubens are valued more highly than any other of his paintings, and the
          portraits of Van Dyke and Titian are the most esteemed of their productions. Take the
          portraits from the list of Reynolds’ works, and there would be nothing left worth having.
          Among our own painters, Copley, Stewart, Trumbull, and Alston’s portraitures comprise the
          best and most numerous of their productions. Perhaps the finest collection of pictures in
          the country, is the Portrait Gallery of Harvard College, which contains some of the finest
          of Copley’s and Stuart’s heads. A bad portrait of a bad subject is certainly not a
          pleasant thing to contemplate ; but a fine portrait of a fine head, is one of the most
          charming and profitable objects in Art. A portrait of Shakspeare by such an artist as Van
          Dyke, would be worth more than all the historical pictures painted in his century. It is
          the true object of
          <a href="#p290"/> 
          Art to counterfeit Nature, and preserve the forms which would be
          forever obliterated without its aid. We would by no means discourage historical
          composition, but then we would have each century paint its own history. It is very obvious
          that no painter can give us a reflection of a past age. We do not want mockeries in a
          picture, but realities. The modest sculptures on the ruins of Palenque, give a more vivid
          impression of the life of the Mexicans, than such pictures as that by Mr. Rothermel in the
          present exhibition can do. The two little pictures by Mr. Mount, numbers 145, 242, will
          convey to our descendants a better idea of their ancestors, than the most learned
          composition by one of themselves ever can. If we must paint historical pictures, let us
          paint our own history, which we thoroughly understand, and leave the dead to paint
          themselves. We want no masquerades on canvas, but living men and women in their real
          characters.</p>

        <p>Our exhibition is rich in portraits, and particularly poor in history pieces, which we
          are extremely happy to see; and we draw more hopeful auguries for the Arts among us, than
          if the case were reversed.</p>

        <p>We miss from the walls of the Academy the perfect portraits of Page, which for many years
          were its chief glory in portraiture. It is a puzzling anomaly that one of the greatest
          artists in the country should be compelled to leave the metropolis, and seek for
          employment in a provincial town. But such is the truth, and a mortifying truth it is, for
          it proves that there is a want of appreciation of the highest order of talent in the
          community, or at least it seems to prove it, for we do not believe that there is any lack
          of enthusiasm for high Art, although fortuitous circumstances may sometimes defeat its
          manifestation.</p>

        <p>New York has just cause to feel pride in her portrait painters, for she monopolizes
          nearly all the talent of the country in this department of Art. And we doubt whether any
          school in Europe can produce so large a number of good portrait painters in the same
          number of artists.</p>

        <p>We have already given the post of honor in The present exhibition to Wenzler, a young
          German artist, who has heretofore given his attention to miniatures. The defect of his
          portraits is their color, which is harmonious, but cold and leaden. It must be owing, we
          think, to his painting in a northern light. The portraits of Hugh Maxwell and Mr. Furness
          are among the very best examples of portraits that we have ever seen, but they are hung in
          a very bad position, and it is not easy to pronounce very clearly upon their technical
          merits; yet they appear perfect in drawing, and only lacking in a little warmth of tone.
          Next to these portraits we must place No. 119, a portrait of Captain Erricsson, by
          Elliott, a young artist, who exhibited his first picture, a portrait of Governor Seward,
          last year. Mr. Elliott is a native of the western part of the State, Syracuse; he is
          destined to occupy a very high position among the artists of the New World. His great
          danger is facility of execution ; he paints with great rapidity, and rarely or never fails
          in the likeness of his subject. The portrait of the celebrated engineer is one of the most
          pleasing in the exhibition. We look at it in vain, seeking for a fault, for it is very
          perfect in its kind, harmonious in color, correct in drawing, free in execution, and
          altogether a most life-like, speaking portrait. We are loth to qualify our praise, but it
          is the least degree in the world sketchy. However, it gains in grace what it lacks in
          solidity and finish. It is truly an admirable picture. No. 220, a portrait of Horace
          Kneeland, is a stronger head and more substantial, and quite as good as a likeness, but it
          lacks the dignified repose indispensable in a portrait. No. 190, the head of an old man
          with a flowing black beard, is an admirable study, painted with surprising freedom and
          truth. No. 128, a Portrait of Mr. Spencer the artist, is a good sober picture. No. 200 is
          a sweet face—the position exceeding graceful and unaffected. It is the least like a
          portrait, and the most like nature, of any one in the room. It is a dewy rose, compared
          with some of the artificial flowers near it.</p>

        <p>No. 199. Portrait of T. Hicks—painted by himself.Lawyers say that the advocate who
          pleads his own cause has a
          fool for his client, and the artist who paints his own
          portrait is sure of satisfying his sitter. Perhaps this is the reason why artists are so
          fond of painting themselves. We believe there are few painters who have not multiplied
          their own faces. The Academy has an absurd rule, requiring its associates to present their
          own portraits to he hung on its walls. They could not have hit upon a better plan for
          securing a collection of bad pictures. At the top of the great stairway, as the visiter
          mounts into the sky-parlor, where, for some inscrutable reason, the Academy holds its
          exhibitions, may be seen the best collection of caricatures in the city. One of the
          greatest curiosities among them is a head labelled “Bryant,” which nobody would suspect
          was meant for the poet of that name. Mr. Hicks's portrait, though painted by himself, is
          very like him, but it is not equal to some of his other portaits. </p>

        <p>No. 23. Portrait of Col. Thayer—R. W. Weir, N. A.A full length portrait in regimentals.
          The position is exceedingly bad. A suspended action in a single figure produces a very
          unpleasant sensation. The head is better painted than any that we have seen by this artist
          before. The legs are admirably foreshortened, but if they had been shortened still more by
          being left off altogether, it would have been a better picture. There cannot possibly be a
          more uninteresting sight than a pair of long legs covered with white linen trow-sers
          sticking out of a portrait. The accessories in this portrait are finished with great care,
          but they are just the parts of the picture which are of not the least consequence. It is
          the only picture that Mr. Weir has in the exhibition.</p>

        <p>No. 27. Portrait of Dr. Macready—J. J. Mapes, H.We knew that Professor Mapes was master
          of an infinite variety of accomplishments, but we were not prepared to see so good a
          portrait as this from his easel. It is a speaking likeness.</p>

        <p>No. 36. Portrait of a Child—J. H. Lazarus.A very sweet picture, but it is so badly hung
          that it can hardly be seen to advantage.</p>

        <p>No 48. Portrait of D- Bryson—E. Mooney, N. A.A sober truthful portrait. No. 55, W.
          Rowell, by the same artist, is equally good. These pictures only lack a little warmth of
          color to render them among the best in the exhibition. Their coldness must be owing to the
          light in which the artist works, for some of his portraits are almost hot in color.</p>

        <p>No. 54. Portrait of Mrs. H. Shelton—F. Boyle. An admirable portrait; well drawn and well
          colored, excepting a sooty hue which Mr. Boyle contrives to invest all his pictures with.
          The position is graceful, the arms well disposed, and the drapery elaborated with great
          care. Mr. Boyle is a painter.</p>

        <p>No. 67. Portrait of Captain Cropper—C. C. Ingham. If Mr. Ingham will do himself the harm
          to paint portraits of men, we hope for his own sake that he will eschew sailors. He cannot
          put the rough externals of a weather-beaten face upon canvass. 169 and 184, two portraits
          of young ladies, are in his happiest manner. The shotted silk in 169 is a miracle, and the
          gauze scarf might deceive one of Stuart’s clerks. The ladies themselves appear to be made
          of finest clay—porcelain.</p>

        <p>No. 69. Portrait—E. H. May. This young artist has two other portraits in the exhibition ;
          the best of the three, and indeed among the best portraits in the room, is No. 130; it is
          altogether a most admirable portrait, modest, substantial, and fleshly.</p>

        <p>No. 83. Brig. Gen. Roumfort, of the Second Brigade, Philadelphia.—W. E. Winn. We are very
          happy to perceive that this is a production of the right-angled city. Why it was sent here
          for exhibition we are at a loss to conceive. Gen. Roumfort may be a brave man and good
          citizen, for aught we know to the contrary, but the artist appears to have tried hard to
          make him look like the reverse. Not content with giving him all the swagger possible, he
          has made the gallant General’s sword several inches longer than its scabbard. It is a
          woful picture, and it brings to mind most woful events, which the Philadelphians should be
          ambitious to forget.</p>

        <p>No. 158. Portrait of a Gentleman.—T. H. Smith. There is nothing in this modest picture,
          excepting the marked character of the subject, to attract attention, and the posi-tion in
          which it is hung not being a favorable one. we should hardly have noticed it had we not
          known the painter to be one of the most industrious, most enthusiastic, and most
          <a href="#p291"/>
          promising of all our young artists. No. 221, another head of an old gentleman, is a very
          truthful, unpretending portrait.</p>

        <p>No. 165. A Greek.—By F. Fink. This portrait attracts a good deal of attention, and is
          universally admired. The hands are exquisitely painted, and the whole picture reflects
          great credit on the artist. But it is not the portrait of a Greek ; it is a gentleman in a
          greek costume, and so it should have been called.</p>

        <p>No. 172. Portrait of Jacob Barker.—By H. Inman, N. A. This is the only portrait by this
          gentleman in the exhibition ; but this is one of the best that he has ever painted. It is
          a good likeness and a very pleasing picture. Considering that it was painted from three
          sittings, and those short ones, it must be regarded among this distinguished artist
          happiest efforts. It is somewhat slight and sketchy, but we see that it is just what the
          artist aims at in painting. The resemblance of the head to the portraits of Doctor
          Franklin is very remarkable.</p>

        <p>Bust of J. J. Mapes. By H. Kneeland. It is to the disadvantage of this excellent bust
          that it is the only one in the exhibition, for it is so true to nature, so finely and
          purely modeled that it requires to be seen by the side of ordinary works to make its
          superiority apparent. It is admirably chiseled, and makes the nearest approach to the
          perfection of Power’s busts of any that we have seen in any previous exhibition. There are
          many portraits still left of real merit which we shall notice hereafter.</p>

        <div class="head">ON WRITING FOR THE MAGAZINES.</div>

        <p>Before the days of magazines, wit and mirth, and quibs and jests, and glorious outbursts
          of temperament, must have lost half their relish without the after enjoyment of being
          produced in the magazines—if indeed they could ever exist in any conversational perfection
          without the suggestions and stimulus of the press. It is notorious now-a-days, or if not,
          it may be very readily observed that men talk to write, and write to talk—that the mutual
          collision of the babble of the club room and the soiree with the silence of the writing
          table, broken only by the music of the pen on paper, makes them perfect in both. One never
          talks with any knowledge till he writes, travelling into the secret labyrinths of thought,
          or writes with feeling till he has been warmed by the countenance and sympathy of the
          living eye and voice. Our ante-magazinists had none of this; they left few records to
          their children of their swift passing moments; they appeared only in state, on special
          occasions in print, and handed down history to us as little better than a Parish
          Register.</p>

        <p>Negligence and ease, with enthusiasm and refinement, are the charms of a magazine. No one
          should care what a writer is deficient in, for this purpose, if he only excite our
          sympathy and awaken our enjoyment. Who is the prince of the magazinists but Christopher
          North, the careless slipshod enthusiast, a glowing Sun breaking upon us all the brighter
          out of the polar austerities of Scotland ? It was a merciful dispensation which sent this
          tropical genius to a clime which might naturally produce only Chamber’s Journals and
          
          
          Information for the people. Soul, soul, soul are the three requisites for the great
          magazine. We like the dishabille air and demi-toilette of authorship, for we feel, where
          these are worn, the surrounding atmosphere is warm and genial. Here we prefer sensibility
          to sense. Political economy may take care of the pocket elsewhere, and the didactic play
          on some other instrument of its own. Our organ should breathe only the heart-stirring
          symphonies of Beethoven. We would have one shelf or more in our library for solid
          Encyclopedias and books of business, and another distinct where the eye may catch the
          golden lettering of the poets, and those prose legers of the heart where the best
          affections are entered up monthly, and an open account kept against Time to the end. What
          a good round balance there will be in favor of John Wilson, Leigh Hunt, and Thomas Hood
          for instance, when three score and ten brings its settlement!</p>

        <p>It will be seen that we restrict the magazine article proper to but one species of
          writing, or rather one way of thinking or feeling, for the illustrations of the faculty
          may be various, ranging through all the wide world of fancy, humor, pathos, not forbidding
          satire—for satire, when it is not pure-ly malevolent, may be enjoyable, bringing us into
          closer companionship with our fellows. The rough points of a satirist’s temperament may be
          the cog-wheels which link us in more closely with the general movement from which we might
          else be separated and unhappy.</p>

        <p>Above all things the magazine must depend upon its interest to us for its contemporary
          matter. It must talk of the day and the hour, the whim or philosophy of the moment, it
          must be immediate and local. It must discourse readily upon the fashionable notoriety of
          the time, or read its homily for the benefit of the newest politician, or satirize the
          latest folly, and turn round to put us in conceit again with its conveniences and virtues.
          Its great aim is to make us pleased with the world as it is, its praise must be the very
          otto of egotism and complacency, its “ feigned abuse such as perplexed lovers use.” It
          should purify the soiled temple of the world, by causing us to forget all the evil and
          reminding us of all the good, removing the mildew of weariness and disgust from its
          shrines and altars, that the spirit may return and worship again pure and undismayed. Life
          would sometimes pall upon us, were it not relieved by the playful graces of the essayist.
          In this day no one can be insensible to the benefits of literature. The most heroic act is
          incomplete till it receive the welcome, the All Hail! of the orator and poet. Fame dwells
          in books. The guardian being wanting, the virtue becomes extinct. If the magazines had
          more power it would be better for the state. We know not what cultivation our statesmen,
          for instance, might receive if their measures were ably reviewed by faithful writers, and
          their speeches commented upon by a body of critics who would be the protectors of manly
          eloquence. No one will long waste intellect where it is unheeded. “ Do not use fulminating
          gold when common gunpowder will do the same,” wrote Moore to Leigh Hunt, when Moore
          thought his friend wus writing too well in the pages of the Reflector. Our politicians are
          in little danger of resorting to such a costly alchy-my. It is different abroad. Pulic men
          approach the public with the fear of the press before their eyes. An English debater
          rounds his periods by the music of the eloquent Times or Examiner, as by the flute of
          Gracchus. Our orators, with no such clarifying medium, speak direct to Bunkum. It is by
          the support and influence of the best men that the best things are done, the best words
          spoken, and the best books written. Pope has explained this in his courtly graceful way: </p>
           
            “But why then publish? Granville the polite, 
             And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write; 
             Well-natured Garth inflamed with early praise, 
             And Congreve lov’d, and Swift endur’d my lays! 
             The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read, 
             E'en mitred Rochester would nod the head, 
             And St. John’s self, great Dryden’s friend before, 
             With open arms receive one poet more.”

        <p>There is nothing more delightful in authorship, than an unchecked genial strain of
          friendly altercation, a rivalry in the appreciation of one another’s qualities, where it
          takes place between men who possess something in themselves worth eulogizing, and are of
          sufficient importance for the world to take an interest in the matter. We know what a much
          dreaded word egotism is in society and among critics, and how instinctively alarm is taken
          by a class of very sensitive persons at the slightest approach to personality; how <a href="#p292"/>
          many very careful guardians there are in the world with the zeal of duennas,
          whose prudish, nicely-educated souls are offended at an improper exhibition of self, and
          we appreciate very kindly the good taste which would reduce men and women to a vapid state
          of insipidity, by closing the mouths of everybody to anything which might prove hazardous
          to the personal comfort of—fools. Yet in spite of all this, we are advocates of plain
          speaking, downright thinking, egotism, personality, and any other terror “within the
          limits of becoming mirth,” and guarded by a never to be relinquished spirit of honest
          dealing. So long as fair play is shown, let us have the game out, come the good or ill
          fortune of it where it may.</p>

        <p>One large class of objectors to the egotism of authors is that numerous body who are not
          authors, and who sometimes affect to be superior to the supposed vanity which, they
          imagine, is at the bottom of these exhibitions in print. Let us look into the matter.
          Waiving, for a moment, all questions of the kind of notoriety, in the case of the author,
          it may be, as it very often is, that the name of a fault-finder, if he be a merchant, for
          instance, is a hundred times in the paper to the author’s once. The most greedy,
          carnivorous candidate for fame, who bites with the avidity of a pike at a newspaper puff,
          and urges his literary wares upon the public, amid the general laughter, and particular
          contempt of his own class, is not half so industrious as the tradesman with his signs,
          bill-heads, check-books, agencies, correspondences, runners, gazetteers, advertisements,
          with his name on every packing box, placarded on every dead wall, running about the
          streets on carts, labelled on sloops, making the tour of rivers on steamboats, from the
          broad bunting to the very plates and dishes in cabin, and the last pewter spoon, or
          reaching that apotheosis of reputation, the figure head and bow of a ship ploughing the
          ocean. A prolific literary rabbit keeps before the people with some diligence, but not
          with half the success of the last pill manufacturer. But, it will be said, the fact is
          nothing, the motive is everything. The merchant pursues notoriety purely as an affair of
          business, of dollar and cents, and, when these are attained, his own private character,
          his domestic interests, his heart and soul, are his own uncorrupted, while the author is
          making trade and merchandize of all that a man should hold most dear and secret, of his
          affections, his sensibilities, the pretended goodness of his heart, and nicety of his
          feelings. Is the merchant so entirely uncorrupted as he represents himself? Is there
          nothing involved in his notoriety-seeking but matters of interest and profit ? Is it all
          outward, material, separable from the man ? No, his good name stands for a thousand things
          besides his dollars and cents. Go into the interior of the country, and see the fluttering
          which the presence of a man whose name has stood a quarter of a century, with honor, in
          Pearl Street, creates. He may be courted for his wealth, but he is respected for all that
          stands behind it, the probity, the self-denial, the industry, the talent, the energy,
          which have made him celebrated. Is name, is notoriety nothing? Why, without any
          impeachment to his modesty, he goes up to the desk of the hotel, and writes his autograph,
          in the traveller’s book, with the air of a man drawing a check on the spectators for an
          unlimited amount of respect, attention and deference, with the certainty of its being
          honored. The merchant seeks notoriety for the same ends, and as nearly as he can, with the
          same means as the author. Talk not of the vanity of authors, and the love of puffs and
          notoriety, ye merchants, before editors. As soothing to the soul of the ship-owner in
          South st., or the Captain on the seas, is a few inches of type, eulogistically arranged,
          as to the glistening eyes of the most self-idolatrous youngster, who ever perpetrated
          rhyme or prose.</p>

        <p>We see that the merchant, in his own argument, does not stand quite clear of the
          suspicions he urges against the author. He is very righteously and commendably
          strengthening his own convictions and deference to duty by the voice of public opinion.
          And he is by no means necessarily making sale of his virtues, because he is prosperous by
          the credit he gets for them. The author assuredly goes further in the voluntary exhibition
          of himself,—in his egotism,—to admit the point at once. It is his vocation. To find fault
          with him for this is to beg the whole question. It is his business to write out what he
          knows, thinks and feels, that other men may learn to know, think and feel. If he were to
          do otherwise, and cease to exhibit, directly or indirectly, his own personal character on
          the page, biography would soon be an
           enumeration of mere platitudes, and would fall
          into the very pretence and puffery sought to be avoided; ignorance would be unquestioned,
          folly respected, and vice unscathed ; there would be one biographical formula, something
          like that in the ladies’ magazines, where character and reputation are dispensed as freely
          as tin money on the stage, where genius, that century-blooming aloe, blooms as rankly as
          the "dandelion in the field, and Shakspeares and Miltons go staggering about in bibs and
          petticoats. What a blessed uniformity of praise there would be !—what charity, what
          kind-heartedness!—how perfect a Utopia, how benevolent a Millennium, if heroes of various
          kinds could have it all their own way, unchallenged by the occasional impertinence of
          interfering sensibility and justice. What is genius but this secret spring of egotism,
          everywhere giving life to books as the water to the landscape which is sometimes hidden
          deep beneath the surface, at others half concealed by foliage, then playing, laughing and
          rejoicing in a thousand streams and rivulets in the full blaze of day ? Egotism will be
          valued always in proportion to the character of the author, as a soil that betrays a vein
          of gold is worth more than one of coal or slate. That it may become a nuisance, is
          undoubted; but in its annoying forms, it carries its own antidote in its very
          barefacedness. But even in its coarser and common forms, it has its value, as in the
          autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, while no passages of the great authors are treasured
          more than those in which they pause, parenthetically, to convey some allusion to
          themselves. Who would lose the supposed personal reference to the blind bard in Homer, or
          the passage on Light in Milton ? and, in spite of what is generally said to the contrary,
          who does not fancy Shaks-peare, probably with justice, a thousand times interposing his
          own sentiments ?</p>

        <p>We have certainly " fetched a compass” to get to our port of magazine writing, and
          vindicate its personalities. Are not our American writers, lecturers, preachers,
          politicians, editors, actors and other publicans, enough talked about ? It may be that
          they are too much talked about, and too little —that their names are better known than
          their actions—that they are often heard of, but poorly understood. We want the niceties of
          knowledge: all is nothing, mere barrenness, till we find out or are taught the peculiar
          secret principle which constitutes their vitality. We do not know anything of the men till
          we know that. We must have a niche for our writers, in the gallery of the mind, otherwise
          they are so much lumber thrown together at the threshold. No man’s knowledge is to be
          valued till he offers you something of his own, which is not to be picked up on the
          highway, or to which has been added some value from use or keeping. We get this rarely.
          Every one knows everything about our public men, few know anything. How little of all that
          has been written can we refer a stranger visiting the country to for a keen, just,
          appreciative character of our worthies! The magazines should be looked to for its
          criticism. Here is a field where the genuine writers of the country should come to one
          another’s help, and not leave the best characters of our authors and statesmen, as is the
          fact at present, to be written abroad. If we wish to learn anything of our great men,
          beyond, of course, the fact that they are great, we must go to Miss Martineau and the
          foreign reviews.</p>

        <p>Authors have always been a generous body of men to one another in dedications,
          compliments, reviews, &amp;c., and there is nothing more graceful or valuable than these
          things, when they are conscientiously bestowed by good and true men. The old scholarship
          of the Continent, the verses prefixed to the Elizabethan editions, the tributes in the
          writings of Hazlitt and his friends, are so many well remembered instances among others.
          It was a peculiarity of the old English authors—insomuch that Leigh Hunt in his new work
          on Imagination and Fancy, has gone somewhat at length and apologetically into the matter,
          in reference to Shakspeare, who mentions none of his contemporaries. “ Has any body,’’
          says he, “discovered the reason why he never noticed a living contemporary, and but one
          who was dead ? and this too, in an age of great men, and when they were in the habit of
          acknowledging the pretensions of one another.”</p>

        <p>How necessary this spirit of appreciation is among others, where literature is an affair
          sustained and defended by the few, is a point only to be suggested. In the present state
          of our literature it is of the next importance to being true to themselves, that literary
          men should be true to one another. Short as our history has been, and comparatively few
          as<a href="#p293"/> have been our men of letters, there has been time to forget and neglect some of
          the best spirits among them. American criticism has yet many a genial hour’s delightful
          toil to come, in making the acquaintance of the inner life of many who are but little
          understood.—Dem. Review.</p>

        <div class="head">AURORA AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE.</div>

        <p> A circular has been issued by several gentlemen of this County, for the
            establishment of an Institute at Aurora, in which young men may become thoroughly
            acquainted with “the principles of Agricultural Science, and their application to
            Practical Husbandry." The plan is one which received the fullest approval of the late
            Judge Buel; and the arrangements made, are such as cannot fail to offer every desirable
            inducement to those interested. The farm chosen consists 212 acres, adjoining the
            beautiful village of Aurora, which is well fitted by soil, location, improvement,
            &amp;c., for such purpose. No pupils under 14 years of age received. Charles C. Young,
            A. M. is Proprietor and principal; A. Thompson, A. M., M. D. Lecturer on Botany,
            Geology, Agricultural Chemistry, &amp;c., and David Thomas, Visitor and
            Adviser.—Auburn Journal.</p>

        <p>Some of our readers may smile at seeing the announcement of an “Agricultural Institute”
          made the subject of an article in the “Broadway Journal,” but we trust that those who have
          had their eyes filled with the dust of Broadway since the breath of Spring has swept our
          streets, (the only sweeping by the way that they get,) will pardon us if we carry their
          mind's eyes to the contemplation of green fields and budding flowers. We are not without
          precedent, too, for introducing rustic themes even into “Broadway,” for which we cite the
          display of huge squashes and mammoth turnips at Niblo’s Saloon every autumn, to say
          nothing of that learned body of citizens called “The Farmer’s Club,” who meet weekly in
          the Park to discuss soils and fertilizing powders.</p>

        <p>Our readers must not suppose that we intend to cut Broadway ; we have no such cruel
          design. We confess too much attachment to city life, to its libraries, and lectures, its
          societies of learned men and its social advantages; we are not yet tired of even coal
          fires and gas lights; we still love to contemplate the various phases of human nature only
          to be found in a large city. Yet with all this admiration for the “town,” we are troubled
          at times with the “spring fever.”</p>

        <p>No sooner does the Battery become green, or the trees in the Park unfold their leaves,
          than we feel an instinctive longing to look at the country. We yearn to pluck the first
          hyacinth of the garden, the earliest blue violet of the field, or the first trilium
          erectum of the woods. We attribute this inclination to the fact of our having spent some
          portion of our early life in the country, a pleasure which we sincerely wish many of the
          young people we meet in our walks could enjoy, while their hearts are fresh, and their
          tastes unformed by the conventional standards of town life.</p>

        <p>It is not our purpose to discourse at length on the importance of an institute founded on
          the plan above stated its benefits to our youth, and especially to the young men of our
          cities, must be apparent to all. Farming, as a learned profession, (we mean a profession
          that requires learning,) is becoming more and more popular; as an accomplishment, it is
          likely soon to become fashionable, and we think the sooner the better ; as an occupation,
          it has charms and advantages to which no other pursuit can lay claim.</p>

        <p>A well ordered school of Agriculture, we conceive to be a great desideratum; and we are
          pleased to see public attention directed to the subject. The day seems to have gone by,
          when education consisted only in learning words, and the whole youthful life must be spent
          on a form, torturing the brain and destroying the body. It has been discovered that
          physical as well as mental training is necessary to the full development of our nature.
          The philosophy of Socrates and Plato—the philosophy of words has long since given way to
          the philosophy of Bacon—the philosophy of works.</p>
        

        <p>To those boys who have for years been poring over dull pages of Greek and Latin, whose
          eyes have become weak and weary with much study—whose brains have been puzzled with
          irregular verbs and heathen Mythology, and their bodies enervated by the confinement of
          the school-room,____how delightful must be the change, to the pure fresh air of the fields
          and the invigorating labor of practical husbandry.</p>

        <p>The situation of the Aurora Institute is peculiarly favorable to the objects for which it
          is established. The eastern bank of the Cayuga Lake, the site of the beautiful village of
          Aurora, is in the centre of the famous wheat growing district of this State ; for beauty
          of scenery, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate it is not surpassed by any section
          of our country.</p>

        <p>In the capacity of Visitor and Adviser, this institute will have the services of one of
          the most competent men in the State. There are many men better known to the public than
          David Thomas, but none more esteemed by the large number of scientific men who rejoice in
          his acquaintance. Well versed in the natural sciences, and peculiarly gifted with the
          faculty of imparting his knowledge to others, he is most fitly chosen for his office.</p>

        <p>Whatever advantages this institution may possess, none will be more truly appreciated by
          the youth who resort thither, than the society and instruction of this learned and good
          man.</p>

        <div class="head">THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK.</div>

        <p>“You hard-hearted, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty, old savage !”
          said I in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at him in
          imagination.</p>

        <p>Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy did exist, just then, between
          what I said and what I had not the courage to say—between what I did and what I had half a
          mind to do.</p>

        <p>The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with his feet upon the
          mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the
          ditty,</p>

        
           Remplis ton verre vide ! 
           Vide ton verre plein ! 
        

        <p>“My dear uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and approaching him with the blandest
          of smiles, “you are always so very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence
          in so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I have only to suggest this little point to
          you once more to make sure of your full acquiescence.”</p>

        <p>“ Hem!” said he, “ good boy ! go on !”</p>

        <p>“ I am sure, my dearest uncle [you confounded old rascal!] that you have no design
          really, seriously, to oppose my union with Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I
          know—ha! ha! ha !—how very pleasant vou are at times.”</p>

        <p>“ Ha! ha ! ha !” said he, “ curse you ! yes!”</p>

        <p>“ To be sure—of course ! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle, all that Kate and myself
          wish at present, is that you would oblige us with your advice as—as regards the time— you
          know, uncle—in short, when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding
          shall—shall—come off, you know?”</p>

        <p>“ Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that ? Better wait till it goes on.”</p>

        <p>Ha ! ba! ha !—he ! he! he!— hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho !— hu!hu!hu!—oh, that’s good!—oh,
          that’s capital—such a wit! But all we want, just now, you know, uncle, is that you would
          indicate the time precisely.”</p>

        <p>“Ah !—precisely ?”</p>

        <p>“ Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”</p>

        <p>“ Would’nt it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random—some time within a year or
          so, for example ?—must I say precisely ?”</p>

        <p>“If you please, uncle—precisely.-</p>

        <p>“Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, are’nt<a href="#p294"/> you ?—since you will have
          the exact time, I’ll—why, I’ll oblige you for once.”</p>

        <p>“ Dear uncle !”</p>

        <p>“Hush, sir!” [drowning my voice]—“I’ll oblige you for once. You shall have my consent—and
          the plum, we mus’nt forget the plum—let me see ! when shall it be ? To-day’s Sunday—is’nt
          it? Well, then, you shall be married precisely—precisely, now mind!—when three Sundays
          come together in a week ! Do you hear me, sir! What are you gaping at ? I say, you shall
          have Kate and her plum when three Sundays come together in a week—but not till then—you
          young scapegrace—not till then, if I die for it. You know me—I’m a man of my word—now be
          off!” Here he swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in despair.</p>

        <p>A very “fine old English gentleman," was my granduncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the
          song, he had his weak points. He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate, semicircular
          somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, a long pur e, and a strong sense of his own
          consequence. With the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of
          contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially, the
          character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a spirit
          of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for
          malevolence. To every request, a positive " No!” was his immediate answer ; but in the
          end— in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few requests which he refused. Against
          all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from
          him, at last was, generally, in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the
          stubbornness of the resistance. In charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse
          grace.</p>

        <p>For the fine arts, and especially for the belles lettres he entertained a profound
          contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “ A
          quoi un poete est il bon?" he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll
          pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had
          excited his entire displeasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of
          Horace, that the translation of “ Poeta nascitur non fit" was a nasty poet for nothing
          fit”—a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to “ the humanities had, also,
          much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural
          science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage
          than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent;
          and just at the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after all—my grand uncle
          Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the
          caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and
          his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that “the
          people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them."</p>

        <p>I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in dying, had bequeathed me
          to him as a rich legacy. I believe the old villain loved me as his own child—nearly if not
          quite as well as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s existence that he led me, after all.
          From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular Hoggings. From five to
          fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of Correction. From fifteen to twenty,
          not a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling. I was a sad
          dog, it is true—but then it was a part of my nature—a point of my faith. In Kate, however,
          I had a firm friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very sweetly that I
          might have her (plum and all) whenever I could badger my grand uncle Rumgudgeon, into the
          necessary consent. Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her little
          amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged
          their slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or even at twenty-one [for 1 had
          now passed my fifth olympiad] five years in prospect are very much the same as five
          hundred. In vain we besieged the old gentleman with importunities. Here was a piece de
          resistance (as Messieurs Ude and Ca-reme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a
          T. It would have stirred the indignation of Job himself, to see how much like an old
          mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice. In his heart he wished for nothing
          more ardently than our union. He had made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he
          would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s plum was her own) if he
          could have invented anything like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes.
          But then we had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to oppose it
          under such circumstances, I sincerely believe was not in his power.</p>

        <p>I have said already that he had his weak points; but, in speaking of these, I must not be
          understood as referring to his obstinacy: that was one of his strong points—“assure-ment
          ce n’etait pas sa foible.” When I mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre
          old-womanish superstition which beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id genus
          omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and,
          after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. This was, in fact, one of his
          hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter
          was a bond inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which
          Kate’s ingenuity enabled us, one fine day, not long after our interview in the dining
          room, to lake a very unexpected advantage ; and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern
          bards and orators, exhausted, in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all
          the room at my disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of
          the story.</p>

        <p>It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among the naval acquaintances of my
          betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just set foot upon the shores of England, after a
          year’s absence, each, in foreign travel. In company with these gentlemen, my cousin and I
          preconcertedly, paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the
          tenth—just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our
          hopes. For about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics; but at last, we
          contrived, quite naturally, to give it the following turn: </p>

        <p>Capt. Pratt. “Well, I have been absent just one year.— Just one year to-day,as I live—let
          me see! yes!—this is October the tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day
          year, to bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does seem something like a coincidence, does
          it not—that our friend Captain Smitherton, here, has been absent exactly a year also—a
          year to-day ?”</p>

        <p>Smitherton. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I
          called with Capt. Pratol on this very day, last year, to pay my parting respects.” </p>

        <p>Uncle. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very queer, indeed ! Both of you gone just
          one year. A very strange coincidence, indeed ! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would
          denominate an extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor Dub—”</p>

        <p>Kate. (Interrupting.) “ To be sure, papa, it is something strange; but then Captain Pratt
          and Captain Smitherton didn’t go alttogether the same route, and that makes a difference,
          you know.”</p>

        <p>Uncle. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzey ! How should I ? I think it only makes
          the matter more remarkable. Doctor Dubble L. Dee”—</p>

        <p>Kate. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain Smitherton doubled the
          Cape of Good Hope.” </p>

        <p>Uncle. “ Precisely !—the one went east and the other went west, you jade, and they both
          have gone quite round the world. By the bye, Doctor Dubble L. Dee"—</p>

        <p>Myself, (hurriedly.) “ Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the evening with us
          to-morrow—you and Smitherton— you can tell us all about your voyage, and we’ll have a game
          of whist, and”—</p>

        <p>Pratt. “Whist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow will be Sunday. Some other
          evening’’—</p>

        <p>Kate. “Oh no, fie !—Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day's Sunday.”</p>

        <p>Uncle. “To be sure—to be sure !’’</p>

        <p>Pratt. “ I beg both your pardon’s—but I can’t be so much mistaken. I know to-morrow's
          Sunday because”—</p>

        <p>Smitherton, (much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about? Was’nt yesterday Sunday,
          I should like to know ?”</p>

        <p>All. “ Yesterday, indeed ! you are out."</p>

        <p>Uncle. “ To-day’a Sunday, I say—don't I know ?’’</p>

        <p>Pratt. Oh no !—to-morrow's Sunday.”</p>

        <p>Smitherton. “ You are all mad—every one of you. I am<a href="#p295"/>
          as positive that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”</p>

        <p>Kate, (jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa, this is a judgment upon you,
          about—about you know what. Let me alone, and I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very
          simple thing, indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it was; he is
          right. Cousin Bobby, and uncle and I, say that to-day is Sunday: so it is; we are right.
          Captain Pratt maintains that to-morrow will be Sunday; so it will ; he is right too. The
          fact is, we are all right, and thus three Sundays have come together in a week."</p>

        <p>Smitherton, (after a pause.) “By the bye, Pratt, Kate has us completely. What fools we
          two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four
          thousand miles in circumference. Now this globed the earth turns upon its own
          axis—revolves—spins round—these twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west to
          east, in precisely twenty-four hours. Do you understand, Mr. Rumgudgeon ?”</p>

        <p>Uncle. “ To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub”—</p>

        <p>Smitherton, (drowning his voice.) “Well, sir: that is at the rate of one thousand miles
          per hour. Now suppose that I sail from this position a thousand miles east. Of course, I
          anticipate the rising of the sun here at London, by just one hour. I see the sun rise one
          hour before you do. Proceeding, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I
          anticipate the rising by two hours—another thousand, and I anticipate it by three
          hours—and so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and back to this spot, when, having
          gone twenty-four thousand miles east, I anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less
          than twenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your time. Understand, eh
          ?"</p>

        <p>Uncle. “ But Dubble L. Dee”—</p>

        <p>Smitherton, (speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the contrary, when he had sailed a
          thousand miles west of this position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four
          thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind the time at London. Thus,
          with me, yesterday was Sunday—thus, with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with Pratt,
          to-morrow will be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is positively clear that we
          are all right; for there can be no philosophical reason assigned why the idea of one of us
          should have preference over that of the other.</p>

        <p>Uncle. “ My eyes !—well, Kate—well, Bobby !—this is a judgment upon me, as you say. But I
          am a man of my word— mark that! you shall have her, boy (plum and all,) when you please.
          Done up, by Jove ! Three Sundays all in a row! I’ll go,and take Dubble L. Dee’s opinion
          upon that.</p>

        Thou wast all that to me, love,
          For which my soul did pine—
          A green isle in the sea, love,
          A fountain and a shrine,
          All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
          And all the flowers were mine.
          Ah, dream too bright to last!
          Ah, starry Hope ! that didst arise But to be overcast!
          A voice from out the Future cries,
          "On ! on !”—but o’er the Past
          (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies Mute, motionless, aghast!
          For, alas! alas ! with me The light of Life is o’er!
          (Such language holds the solemn sea To the sands upon the shore)
          Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
          Or the stricken eagle soar!
          And all my days are trances,
          And all my nightly dreams 
          Are where thy dark eye glances,
          And where thy footstep gleams—
          In what ethereal dances,
          By what eternal streams.

            <div class="head">The first Three Books of Homer’s Iliad, according to the Ordi-dinary
            Text, and also with the restoration of the Digamma, to which are appended English Notes,
            critical and explanatory, a Metrical Index, and Homer’s Glossary. By <span class="person" id=""> Charles
              Anthon</span>, L.L. D., Jay Professor of the Greek and Latin Languages in Columbia
            College, New York, and Rector of the Grammar School. New York: Harper &amp;
            Brothers.</div>

            <p>This is one of the series of “School and College Classics” which have attracted so
            general an attention, first, from their comprehensiveness, and admirable adaptation to
            their objects, and, secondly from their punctilious accuracy and beauty of typographical
            execution. We have seen richer, gaudier, but never more truly beautiful books. The Greek
            text, in this Homer, with the frequent digammas, is certainly the most graceful and
            picturesque specimen of printing we ever beheld.</p>

            <p>The volume contains all of the Iliad which is usually read at school, as preparatory to
            a collegiate course—sufficient to furnish the student with the principles of Homeric
            translation and analysis. The text is, in the main, that of Spitz-ner, which is now
            generally regarded as the best;—although on some occasions, alterations have been
            adopted, and the reasons given in a note. Besides the regular text of Spitzner, there is
            that of Richard Payne Knight, with the digamma restored according to his views. In fact,
            it is by no means improbable that this secondary text is at least a close approximation
            to the ancient orthography of Homer—although many discrepancies might be pointed out,
            going to show that in many cases the learned commentator could not have been otherwise
            than wrong in his conjectures. The work of Knight is extremely rare in this country, and
            even as a mere matter of curious speculation, Dr. Anthon has rendered a public service
            by introducing the restorations in question.</p>

            <p>The commentary, as in all this series of classics, is peculiarly full and
            explicit—proceeding on the sole ground which is admissible in matters of scholastic
            instruction—the ground that the scholar is absolutely ignorant, and has need of
            information at all points, however seemingly trivial. No error is more fatal in tuition,
            than that of taking it for granted that the student knows any thing at all. The
            materials of the Notes are derived, chiefly, from Wolf, Heyne, Buttman, Na-gelsbach, and
            Stadelmann, and the Commentary includes every thing that is really valuable in the works
            of these eminent scholars. The Glossary is separated from the Notes, - a very judicious
            arrangement—and contains a great deal of novel information in regard to the parsing of
            the Homeric Greek. It is distinguished, also, from every Homeric Lexicon which has
            preceded it (in English) by its introduction and application to the Homeric text, of the
            Sanscrit and Linguistic Etymologies:—an Index to the Glossary is subjoined. The Metrical
            Index has been constructed with especial reference to the doctrine of the digamma and
            its bearing upon the Homeric versification.</p>

            <p>Upon the whole, this edition of Homer is not only one of the most valuable of the
            series, but one of the most important additions to classical literature which this
            country or any other has produced.</p>

            <div class="head">Letters from New York. Second Series. By <span class="person" id="">L. M.
              Child</span>. New York. C. S. Francis, &amp; Co. 1845.</div>

            <p>The great popularity of the first series of Mrs. Child’s letters from New York, will
            insure a hearty welcome and a large sale for this new volume. Without possessing any of
            the charms which private epistles derive from their confidential revelations and bits of
            private scandal that all people love, the letters of Mrs. Child make a direct appeal
              to<a href="#p296"/>
             every human heart and cause the reader to feel as though they had been
            addressed to himself personally. It is because the author opens her own heart that she
            gains admission to the hearts of others so rapidly. Nothing will so disarm reserve as
            confidence; ice can alone be melted by heat; hatred and anger must be overcome by love
            and kindness. Bitter, sarcastic writers can never hope for popularity, or at least love.
            We rarely see one of Swift’s essays carried about as a pocket companion, but the good
            natured genial writings of Goldsmith are oftener bound up as pocket volumes than the
            works of any other author. The popularity of Mrs. Child’s letters must be attributed to
            a similar cause ; and to the fact that they treat of human beings and things that
            interest humanity. The sympathies of men are more wide than we are apt to believe. The
            stories of washerwomen, of street-sweepers and little beggar children, interest us
            beyond the most elaborate histories of merely official personages. Mrs. Child
            instinctively seizes upon subjects which are interesting to all classes, to men and
            women rather than to statesmen, or ladies and gentlemen. The present volume of her
            letters has a most taking table of contents. 'Christmas,’ 'Ole Bul,’ 'New Year’s
            Festivities,’ 'Valentine’s Day,’ 'Fourth of July,’ 'Children in Union Park,’ 'Genius and
            Skill,’ ‘Greenwood Cemetery,’ 'The Violin,’ 'Autumn Woods,’ The Spirite of Trade,’ 'Sir
            Harry Falkland;’ these are some of the titles to the letters ; suggestive of charming
            reading and delightful heart-touching subjects.</p>

            <p>We make an extract from the last letter.</p>

            <p>Rapid approximation to the European style of living is more and more observable in this
            city. The number of servants in livery visibly increases every season. Foreign artistic
            upholsterers assert that there will soon be more houses in New York furnished according
            to the fortune and taste of noblemen, than there are either in Paris or London ; and
            this prophesy may well be believed, when the (act is considered that it is already not
            very uncommon to order furniture for a single room, at the cost of ten thousand dollars.
            There would be no reason to regret this lavishness, if the convenience and beauty of
            social environment were really increased in proportion to the ex- penditure, and if
            there were a progressive tendency to equality in the distribution. But, alas, a few
            moments’ walk from saloons superbly furnished in the style of Louis 14th, brings us to
            Loafer’s Hall, a dreary desolate apartment, where shivering little urchins pay a cent
            apiece, for the privilege of keeping out of watchmen’s hands, by sleeping on boards
            ranged in tiers.</p>

            <p>But the effects of a luxurious and artificial life are sad enough on those who indulge
            in it, without seeking for painful contrast among the wretchedly poor. Sallow
            complexions, feeble steps, and crooked spines, already show an obvious deterioration in
            beauty, grace, and j vigor. Spiritual bloom and elasticity are still more injured by
            modes of life untrue to nature. The characters of women suffer more than j those of men,
            because their resources are fewer. Very many things are considered unfeminine to be
            done, and of those duties which are feminine by universal consent, few are deemed
            genteel by the upper classes. It is not genteel for mothers to wash and dress their own
            children, or make their clothing, or teach them, or romp with them in the open air. Thus
            the most beautiful and blessed of all human relations performs but half its healthy and
            renovating mission. The full, free, joyful growth of heart and soul is everywhere
            impeded by artificial constraint, and nature has her fountains covered by vanity and
            pride. Some human souls, finding themselves fenced within such narrow limits by false
            relations, seek fashionable distinction, or the excitement of gossip, flirtation, and
            perpetual change, because they can find no other unforbidden outlets for the
            irrepressible activity of mind and heart. A very few, of nature’s noblest and strongest,
            quietly throw off the weight that presses on them, and lend a comparatively true life in
            the midst of shams, which they reprove only by example. Those who can do this, without
            complaint or noise, and attempt no defence of their peculiar course, except the daily
            beauty of their actions, will work out their freedom at last, in the most artificial
            society that was ever constructed ; but the power to do this requires a rare combination
            of natural qualifier. For the few who do accomplish this difficult task, I even feel
            more respect than I do for those who struggle upward under the heavy burden of early
            poverty. “For wealth bears heavier on talent, than poverty. Under gold mountains and
            thrones, who knows how many a spiritual giant may lie crushed down and buried?” I once
            saw a burdock shoot up so vigorously, that it threw off a piece of board in the
            platform, which covered it front light and air. I had great respect for the brave plant,
            and even carried my sympathy so far, as to reproach myself for not haring lifted the
            board it was trying to bard to raise, instead of watching it curiously, to see how much
            it could do. The pressure of artificial life, I cannot take off from souls that are born
            in the midst of it; and few have within themselves such uplifting life as the
            burdock.</p>

            <p>It is one of the saddest sights to see a young girl, born of wealthy and
            wordly parents, full of heart and soul, her kindly impulses continually checked by
            etiquette, her noble energies repressed by genteel limitations. She must not presume to
            love any body, till father and mother find a suitable match ; she must not laugh loud
            because it is vulgar ; she must not walk fast because it is ungenteel; she must not work
            in the garden, for fear the sun and wind may injure her complexion; she must sew nothing
            but gossamer, lest it mar the delicacy of her hands ; she must not study, because
            gentlemen do not admire literary ladies. Thus left without ennobling objects of
            interest, the feelings and energies are usually concentrated on frivolous and
            unsatisfactory pursuits, and woman becomes a by-word and a jest, for her giddy vanity,
            her love of dress and beaux.</p>

            <div class="head">The Pencil of Nature. By <span class="person" id="">H. Fox Talbot</span>: London,
            1844. Imported by Wiley &amp; Putnam, 161 Broadway. Nos. 1 and 2.</div>

            <p>This is the first attempt to publish a series of pictures, made entirely by Nature
            herself. They are produced by the photographic process, and are of course as true,
            excepting in color, as truth herself. These reflections of Nature are fixed upon
            sensitive paper instead of metal plates, as in the Da-guerrian process; and each picture
            is an original work. The “Pencil of Nature” is a somewhat fanciful term, and not a very
            correct one, for these impressions partake of the character of a medallion more than of
            painting. But we are not disposed to pick differences about terms, the work itself is
            entitled to the highest consideration, and every one who inspects it will draw his own
            auguries of its influence on the imitative Arts. The author gives a very full and lucid
            statement of the first discovery of his art, and of the process by which it has been
            carried to its present high condition. By pure chance, Monsieur Daguerre has reaped
            nearly all the honors of the discovery which Mr. Fox Talbot made simultaneously with
            him. There are twelve plates in the two numbers of Mr. Talbot’s publication, which very
            satisfactorily prove the importance of the art in giving actual views of almost any kind
            of still life. In making copies of architectural ornaments and pictures, it must be
            found of very great advantage; and even in copying curious manuscripts and rare old
            books, it is found of great service, as may be seen from a fac-simile of a page of an
            old Norman-French book, containing the statutes of Richard the Second.</p>

            <p>The view on the Boulevard at Parts, taken from one of the upper windows of the Hotel de
            Douvres on the corner of the Rue de la Paix, is a most delightful picture which
            transports the spectator in a visit to the French Capital. It has nothing of the
            doubtful aspect or indistinctness of a painting, but is indeed. Paris itself. The street
            has just been watered and is under repair, as seen by a couple of wheel-barrows which
            stand in the fore ground. By the road side a row of Cittadines and Cabriolets are
            waiting, and a carriage is standing in the distance. It is the Broadway, as much as this
            is Broadway which we look into when we raise our head. But, goodness, what a range of
            fantastic chimney-pipes borders the horizon, forest of flues of all conceivable shapes.
            The corner house on the right hand is a bathing house, with "Bains” painted on the wall.
            Saving the mansion with a railing in front it looks for all the world like a New York
            house; we can look into the garret window and almost discern a Grisette at her
            employment. It is a cheap view of Paris.</p>

            <p>The most charming of all the impressions however is the reflection of an English
            haystack, which brings us an English market scene as truly as though we were looking out
            of an English window upon an English farm-yard. The sunshine which falls upon it is
            English sun-shine; it has lighted up an object three thousand miles away, and now shines
            as brightly on our desk as it did a year ago in Somersetshire, or in pleasant Kent, for
            the locality of the haystack is not given. The book itself, considered merely as a book,
            is a rare specimen of luxurious publishing, and the ornament on the cover is worth to an
            ornamental artist, for a study, more than its contents</p>

            <p>This poem was announced as about to be published in the fall of 1842, but withheld for
            private reasons. It is the longest dramatic work ever written, we believe, by an
            American,—occupying more than 280 pages, large duodecimo. The history on which it is
            founded, is contained in the Books of Samuel, commencing with the twentieth chapter of
            the first book, and ending with the first chapter of the second. “It may be proper to
            say," says the author in a note, "that I am not acquainted with any other poem in the
            language plotted<a href="#p297"/>
            on the same incidents. Mr. Sotheby’s Epic, which very probably occupies the

            on the same theme, and with the same title and hero which have been already employed by
            another, could have forborne (at least after the completion of his own work) to peruse
            the work of his fellow-laborer in the field, is to our apprehension, we say, a eery
            remarkable thing, and plainly shows Mr. Coxe to be a very remarkable man.</p>

            <p>We have no faith in dramatic poems—they are paradoxical. What is poetical is not
            dramatic—what is dramatic is never poetical. “Saul,” however, is not entitled a
            “Dramatic Poem,” but a “ Mystery”—and if there is any thing in the World we detest, it
            is a mystery of any kind. We confess, therefore, that we proceed to the perusal of this
            book with a host of prejudice. We do not think we shall like it, and if we do not, we
            shall endeavor to say so, in the plainest of all possible terms.</p>

            <p>In our next " Journal,” we shall review the poem in full. At present, we have time only
            to extract a peculiar passage,— the whole of the first scene of the fourth act.</p>

          
            Merodach. There crashed an avalanche,
            From highest Libanus:
            And ho ! another falls a-near,
            Glancing a thousand moonbeams,
            As the crystal rocks of ice,
            Go thundering down below.
            And hark! it is the mother-eagle screams,
            As snaps the high branched pine,
            And her nest and her brood are buried.
            Far, far, in the valley below,
            The peasant awakes in fear,
            As he hears the alarum on high,
            And the booming destruction comes down !
            He wakes, and he prayeth his prayers;
            The prayers that he prayeth are vain.
            A mountain is piled on his roof and his home,
            And the cry, and the crashing are still.
            (Climbs higher.)
            Earth, in these solitudes,
            Makes bold to talk with God,
            And lifts her head sublime to heaven,
            Where breaks no mortal voice On the long Sabbath of her quietness.
            But spirits, where are ye In icy fetters pining;
            Ye who once chained the soul of Saul;
            Ye whom the harp disarmed,
            When David rallied his good angels,
            To drag ye hither through the viewless ? Spirits, say where !
            (Pauses.)
            If such the might of song;
            Ye too shall have enchanters Mimicking once more The spell of Moses’ rod:
            And Pytho shall be praised upon the lyre,
            Loud as the Hebrew’s Lord.
            A blind old man shall be To roam the sunny islands,
            That float upon the sea,
            And on their hills, and on their valleys,
            Forever, shall his song enshrine A fair idolatry.
            (Climbs higher.)
            Enchantress hear'st me not,
            That calledst me afar?
            I come to bid the spirits back again,
            And seven beside, more strong.
            Their harper foe is gone forever,
            And Saul is thine once more.
            Say witch, where art thou ?
            Come on !
            Merodach. Ah, Magdiel, art thou there ?
            Voice. Ay, teaching the new seven. Did ye hear
            The snowballs that we bowled upon your head?

        <div class="head">THE MAGAZINES. The Knickerbocker. Democratic Review. Hunt’s Merchant’s Magazine.
          American Review and Whig Magazine.—(Colton.)</div>

        <p>The Knickerbocker presents its customary variety in its table of contents besides a grand
          piece de resistance, composed of A. Pike, and its Editor’s table the usual variety of
          pleasant gossip. We are sorry to see that Mr. Clark has involved himself in a quarrel with
          Mr. Hudson, and more so that he should have found anything in our own columns that by
          transplanting will wear an appearance of hostility to that gentleman. Our remarks, which
          the Editor of the Knickerbocker has quoted, were meant to apply solely to Mr. Hudson’s
          manner, and not to his matter, for we had not heard enough of his lectures to enable us to
          form an opinion of his views of his subject; but we were strongly impressed with a feeling
          of respect for Mr. Hudson’s opinions, from the little that we did hear.</p>

        <p>The feature of the Democratic Review is an essay on education by Mr. Hudson, from which
          the public may form a correct idea of his style and thoughts. Many who have long been in
          the habit of calling all New-Englanders reformers and transcendentalists, will be struck
          with his strong Conservatism. Mr. Hudson has constantly an eye to the future, like the
          majority of his countrymen, but he also keeps an eye fixed steadily upon the past. He
          believes in the good old times. The Democratic has several admirable articles besides Mr.
          Hudson’s. The Essayist on English letter writers from the time of Howell to Lamb, makes a
          very singular omission in leaving Horace Walpole out of his Catalogue. This is like
          leaving Shakspeare out of the list of English Dramatists, or Fielding from the Catalogue
          of Novelists. Walpole is the only Englishman whose letters form the circulating portion of
          his works. We read the letters of other authors on account of their other productions :
          but we read Walpole’s works, because we have read his letters. We have extracted a good
          part of the Essay on writing for the Magazines, for its genial humor and magazinity, into
          another part of our columns. The portrait of the Democratic for this month is a striking
          likeness of McDuffie, of South Carolina, copied from a daguerreotype.</p>

        <p>Hunt's Magazine has a translation from M. Coquelin, by Henry C. Carey, of Philadelphia,
          on the Commercial Associations of France and England, a paper on the Erie Canal
          Enlargement, by J. B. Jervis, of New-York, on the Corn Trade of the United Stales, by
          Charles Hudson, of Massachusetts, a review of the Exploring Expedition, and a great amount
          of of statistical matter.</p>

        <p>The American Review, Mr. Colton's Whig Magazine, is almost a duplicate of the Democratic
          Review excepting the complexion of its politics. The first article, by Dr. Bacon “ The
          Mystery of Iniquity,” is forcibly written, and infinitely more exciting than any of the
          ‘mysteries’, not excepting Saul, that have recently been published. It reads very much
          like a chapter from the mysteries of Paris. The paper by Mr. Hudson “on reading” will do
          very well as a Se-qaul to one on Education in the Democratic. It is worth an infinite
          number of such Essays as that by Pycroft, a cheap edition of which has recently been
          published. The review of the ‘ Vestiges of Creation,’ is the most vigorous attack that has
          yet been made on that much abused and much be-praised work. The embellishment of the Whig
          Review, is a portrait of John Quincy Adams, neither very commenda-ble as a portrait or as
          a work of art. The biographi-cal sketch of the old-man-eloquent, as the country
          news-papers will persist in calling the venerable ex-President, contains an extract from
          his diary when he was twenty-five years old, which will let him down in the eyes of good
          people several rounds on the ladder of fame.</p>

        <p>Taking them together, these four works exhibit a higher reach in the department of
          magazine literature, than the country has ever offered before. While the three dollar
          magazine, cheap and flashy, flourish best in Philadelphia, the five dollar ones thrive
          best in New York ; indeed it is the only place, except Richmond, Va., where one has ever
          thrived at all. But there is still room for another to administer<a href="#p298"/>
          to tastes and preserve interests, which the others neglect. No magazine in this
          country has yet done anything for the interests of art, but there is a growing appetite in
          tne American people for works of artistic excellence, which we trust that some intelligent
          publisher will before long turn to a profitable account.</p>

            <div class="head">Blackwood.</div>
            <p>—Mess. Leonard, Scott &amp; Co. have issued the April number of Blackwood. It cont .ins
            eight papers of varied excellence, but all good. “ Ping-Kee’s view of the stage” is
            piquant exceeding, ly, and North’s Account of Dryden (although disfigured with the usual
            carelessness and rant of Wilson) is an admirable essay. The continuation of the papers
            called “ Confessions of an Opium Eater” is better, we think, than the original—which was
            a lie throughout. There is yet room for a book on opium eating, which shall be the most
            profoundly interesting volume ever penned. It would be written, however, by no De
            Quincy.</p>

      <div>
        <div class="head">EOTHEN</div>

        <p>The editor of the Buffalo Journal has started an ingenious thought in respect to this
          brilliant book of travel, which will not in the smallest degree diminish its value, even
          though his thought should prove a fact. He thinks that Eothen was composed upon the plan
          of the Amber Witch and Lady Wil-, loughby’s Diary, and that the success of the former work
          led to the composition of Eothen. We copy a part of his re-; marks, which are certainly
          very plausible.</p>

        <p> We are more than half inclined to suspect that the success of the Amber Witch has
            provoked the really clever writer of Eothen to test, by a like experiment, the boasted
            infallibility of the English Review-ers. Sparkling as most of the sketches in Eothen
            are, there is not from beginning to end a single passage that could not have been
            writ-ten by a man of vivid imagination—such as the writer evidently possesses__without
            removing from his library. Hundreds of writers of works, avowedly fictitious, display
            quite as much of graphic fidelity to nature in describing scenery, costumes and manners,
            with which they have no other acquaintance than through books.</p>

        <p> The reader of Eothen will note that the author carefully avoids all ticklish
            ground, and never ventures upon any description the fidelity of which can be tested by
            actual observation. Thus his journey from Belgrade to Constantinople, his residence in
            that city, his visit to the plain of Troy, his description of Smyrna, &amp;c., although
            specimens of very beautiful writing, are yet so vague, shadowy, and indistinct, that of
            the thousands who have visited the same places none can say that this is true, this
            false, except in the general way that every well read man can make the same averment—We
            see the writer and read his reflections, but we see nothing of the East.
        </p>

        <p> His visit to Lady Hester Stanhope is described with more particularity of detail,
            for the reason that on such a theme the writer felt himself on safe ground. Lady Hester
            is dead, and so cannot contradict any statement he may make, and besides, she was so
            eccentric, saw so few travellers, and her mood so changed from time to time, that the
            writer of Eothen might let his fancy run riot in description, and none could convict him
            of fiction. His adventures in Palestine, with descriptions of what he saw, could easily
            have been made up from books, and the hints derived from the conversation of friends who
            had actually visited the Holy Land. The whole of that portion looks like patch-work,
            made brilliant by the glow of a fervid imagination.
        </p>

        <p> But we are willing to stake the whole argument on the chapter of “Cairo and the
            Plague.’' If any one can read that and verily believe the writer ever witnessed and
            passed through what he professes, he need not stagger at any thing. The same is true of
            what he says respecting the Pyramids, and that incredible, solitary ride on a
            drome- dary, in the night, across the desert, to Suez.—Look, too, at Baalbec,
            despatched, literally, in a dozen lines of dreamy mystification, containing not one
            definite idea. We might go on with particulars, but these are enough to direct inquiry
            to the point we wish. The mocking tone in which much of the book is written, gives
            piquancy to it, while at the same time it suggests that the wicked writer was chuckling
            over the success of his scheme to mystify the Aristarchuses of the reviews. The view we
            have taken of the book in no way detracts from its literary merits, which are of a very
            high order; but what fun it will be to the writer to have so effectually mystified the
            erudite, elaborate, and solemn Quarterly, the keen, critical acumen of Blackwood, and
            the very respectable reading public generally ? We should like to have the opinions of
            our critical friends of the Mirror and the Broadway Journal upon this matter.
        </p>

        <p>If the travels of Bruce, published with his own name, and accompanied by numerous
          original drawings of the objects that he saw in his journeyings, were looked upon as
          apocryphal, it would not be a strange matter if a book like Eothen, which has been
          published anonymously, should be regarded as a fiction. But its authenticity has never
          been doubted in England, where the author must be well known. Its authorship has been
          attributed to a barrister named Trevilian, and we have no doubt that it is a perfectly
          true book. The beauty of the style, the light-hearted novelesque manner of the narrative,
          and the absence of such statistical matter as we generally find in books of travel, all
          help to give it an air of romance. But these are just the points which a good artist, like
          the author of Eothen, would have regarded, and to make his book appear true, he would have
          introduced some of the characteristics of other true books ; as the author of the Amber
          Witch has done. But its originality is one of the strongest evidences of its genuineness.
          Nothing could be more easy than to get up, without leaving one’s library, a book of
          Eastern travel that would thoroughly deceive the public ; but only a very great artist
          could have hit upon the novel idea of practising a deception by framing a work unlike any
          other that had ever appeared on the same subject, and instead of using the same materials
          which others had brought from the east, to reject them altogether. But it would be
          impossible for the author to take his reader to a region which he had never visited
          himself. Eothen brings the east to us more vividly than any other eastern traveller has
          done ; such spots as Baalbec are hurriedly and dreamily sketched, because other travellers
          had described them minutely. There is a minuteness of honesty in many parts of Eothen,
          which appears exceedingly like the work of an ingenious artist rather than the effect of
          an ingenuous mind ; but they are few, and the marks of sincerity and honesty are many. We
          read the work with entire faith, satisfied that if the author were not a true traveller,
          he was in the highest degree a true artist.</p>

        <div class="head">BOBUS SMITH.</div>

        <p>It is not generally known to American readers, that the Rev. Sydney Smith had a brother
          who was nearly as bright a genius as the great wit himself. Robert Smith, commonly called
          Bobus by his friends, died just a fortnight after the decease of his elder and more famous
          brother. We find the following biographical notice in the last number of the London
          Critic, the new weekly review which defends the cause of Young England ;</p>

        <p> “It has very recently fallen to our lot to attempt some commemoration of the life,
          character, and genius of the late Rev. Sydney Smith. We little apprehended at the time
          that we should so soon afterwards be called upon to record the death of his brother, elder
          by one year, Robert Smith, Esq., which took place on the day fortnight after the other.
          These two | most remarkable men had always entertained a strong degree | of reciprocal
          attachment and admiration for each other; but the life of the elder had, especially of
          late years, been so comparatively withdrawn from the more prominent scenes of business and
          society, that we have little doubt that we shall surprise the larger proportion of our
          readers by affirming that, while the younger justly attracted an ampler share of the
          public notice by the more active part he bore in questions<a href="#p299"/> and measures
          affecting the public welfare, and while in a species of inspiration which he imparted to
          mirth and wit, though by no means his most valuable characteristic, he, among the men of
          his own, and perhaps of any time, may with truth be pronounced inimitable; at the same
          time, we believe that the most discerning of the contemporaries who were happy enough to
          enjoy the friendship of both—we are sure that the lamented Sydney himself—would in extent
          of acquirement, in original force of thought, in mastery of mind, have given the palm to
          Robert, or to call him by the name he inherited from the happy familiarity of early days,
          Bobus Smith. </p>

        <p> “We cannot pretend to give a full or accurate account of his life. He was born iu
            1770. At Eton he was the intimate associate of Canning, Frere, and Lord Holland, and a
            contri-butor to the Microcosm. At Cambridge he materially added to the reputation for
            scholarship and classical composition which he had established at school; and if the
            most fastidi-ous critic of our day would diligently peruse the three Triposes which he
            composed in Lucretian rhythm, on the three systems of Plato, Descartes, and Newton, we
            believe that we should not run the least risk of incurring the charge of exaggeration,
            in declaring our belief that these compositions in Latin verse have not been excelled
            since Latin was a living language. Be this said with the peace of Milton and Cowley—with
            the peace of his fellow Etonians, Grey and Lord Wellesley.
        </p>

        <p> “We are not aware that we can refer to any subsequent compositien by Mr. Smith
            which could be put on a level with these youthful effusions. We should, indeed, imagine
            that no person with his powers of intellect had ever published so little. Nor were his
            achievements in active public life, from the same fastidious aversion to display, though
            by no means wanting in usefulness, at all commensurate with the ideas conceived of him
            by every one that approached him. He was nine years in Bengal as Advocate General, and
            one short extract from Sir James Macintosh’s Diary may show the value entertained for
            him there:—“I hear frequently of Bobus; always merry and always kind. Long live Bobus !”
        </p>

        <p>We believe his acquaintances were disposed to form brilliant auguries of what he was
          likely to effect as a speaker in Parliament. His first essay, in 1812, is supposed not to
          have come up at least to the mark of his own fastidious judgment, and he seldom afterwards
          addressed the House at any length, or upon subjects which excited the contest and passions
          of parties. He rendered, however, really eminent services as a most diligent and
          pains-taking member of committees, which might have put many an idle mediocrity to the
          blush. He finally retired from Parliament in 1826. He spent the remainder of his life in
          comparative retirement, in the serene enjoyment of the various literature he loved, and
          the cheerful intercourse of the restricted society that delighted him. Nothing can be
          imagined more rich and racy in its variety of material, and in its force of reflection,
          than his conversation. “ Pourquoi ne parlez-vous comme-ca dans la Cham-bre des Communes?"
          said Madame de Stael to him one day, after listening for some time to its eloquent flow;
          though there was in it nothing of the harangue, in its manly ease and simplicity it
          partook of his character; there was much in him of the sturdy Saxon combined with the
          refined and thoroughly finished scholar. No one was ever so clear of all frippery, and the
          only thing for which he probably felt no toleration was a prig. Of his conversation Mr.
          Canning said “Bobus's language is the essence of English.”</p>

        <p>In his inner domestic life he was full of gentle and attaching qualities. He married
          Caroline Vernon, daughter of Richard Vernon, esq. and Evelyn, Countess of Upper Ossory. He
          lost a son and a daughter in their prime of youth, each of most rare promise. His eldest
          son, and only surviving child, is the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, M. P. for
          Northampton.</p>

        <div class="head">Professor Gouraud.—</div>
         <p>The following extract from the Professor's lecture on
          Memory, is a remarkable instance of fluent writing in a foreigner, who, three or four
          years since, was almost ignorant of our languge. M. Gouraud’s style is somewhat too
          luxuriant for these days of classic severity, but it has wonderful ease as the production
          of a foreigner.</p>

          <p>Already have the birds of night, preceded by the white-winged owl, who seems to serve
            them as a warning beacon, begun to regain their obscure retreats in the shadowy depths
            of the forests: the timid hare  and cautious deer have already left the open fields
            for the more propi- tious shadow of the woods. At their return, the implacable eagle and
            the voracious hawk begin to prepare anew their sharp talons for the morning’s hunt;
            while, disengaging their heads from underneath the warm wings which covered them during
            the night, the birds of day among whom they must soon choose again their prey, little
            foreseeing the cruel fate which may and which must before long overtake them, open their
            eyes, shuffle their glossy feathers, and begin to hop from branch to branch, as if to
            stretch their little limbs, and prepare their light wings for flight. </p>

          <p>All at once, the air rings with a melodious sound, which causes the atmosphere to
            vibrate afar, with a sweet and tremulous thrill; the echo, hitherto silent, repeats it
            in successive adulations to the distant streamlet of the valley. Immediately cadencing a
            harmonious rou-lade, which seems to run over a thousand varied notes at once the fairy
            voice which produced these ravishing sounds awakens all the surrounding echoes, and they
            repeat it in chorus—while the voice itself seems to pause, as if, submerged in the
            torrent of harmonies with which she has filled the atmosphere, she were listening to
            herself in rapturous astonishment. At these enchanting accents, the joyous troop are
            suddenly arrested, as if under the infatuation of a spell to listen also; for they have
            recognised the harmonious ringing notes of the lyric enchantress of the groves, the
            morning leader of the song-sters of the forest—the melodious nightingale ! who, already
            preluding at her morning concerts, offers thus abruptly her first salutations to Aurora,
            always attentive to her songs. It would seem indeed that her melodious notes had been
            carried by the surrounding echoes even to the carminated gates of the horizon, and were
            understood by the elements; for Aurora at the moment seems to have redoubled her pace.
            The birds, preluding already to the harmonies of their matin hymns, seem to prepare
            themselves for singing her triumphs. At their head is the rustic cuckoo, the gay linnet,
            the lively red-breast and the sensitive turtle-dove. The nightingale by their side,
            presiding t over the concert, redoubles her harmonious cadences, as the Goddess of the
            dawn approaches. Most of the stars have vanished from the firmament; the heavens now
            appear like an ocean of shining gold and liquid gems of a thousand hues. And now Aurora
            reigns in undisputed sovereignty. But, alas! “ a natural image of pleasure: as nothing
            is more beautiful than her reign, so nothing is shorter than its duration.”</p>

          <p>The god of day follows her with hasty steps ; she must soon resign her empire, like the
            night, which just now fled so rapidly before her. In vain the hours, with redoubled
            energy, scatter in precipitated floods their bouquets of roses beneath her steps; she
            must finally yield—the god of day has almost overtaken her ! Already he is announced by
            the more vivid tints which he pours around him. The glowing rays but just precede the
            dazzling glare; the east seems on fire : it appears suddenly all in flames. At their
            effulgency, the burning disc is each moment expected ; at every instant he seems about
            to appear—at last he rises majestically from the liquid abyss! A brilliant pencil of
            flame, starting forth like a flash of lightning, and suddenly filling all space, seems,
            like the bow of a celestial orchestra, to have given the last signal for the awakening
            of all nature. It is the Sun, who has just touched upon the horizon with the edge of his
            inflamed disc.— Red as a purpuereal sphere of gleaming Vermillion, and at first of an
            immense size, he gradually ascends from behind a wide-spreading curtain of clouds, which
            he soon pierces with a thousand pencils of light, forming a gigantic glory, whose
            superior rays curve themselves into an immense arch, which reaches to the zenith. “ Then
            the veil of darkness being entirely effaced, man is again permitted to recog-nise his
            abode, which he finds everywhere beautified and embellished. The verdure has taken
            during the night fresh vigor and renewed fresh-ness ; the new-born day which shines upon
            it, the first rays which gild it display it covered with a brilliant net-work of dew,
            which reflects to the eye the light and the colors of the rainbow !”</p>

          <p>The merry troop is again arrested to contemplate with ecstatic feel-ings the glorious
            spectacle, which has been thus gradually developed before them. Meanwhile all nature has
            been awakened, at that sub-lime moment,—when the disc of the sun touched lightly upon
            the horizon—the birds were re-united in chorus, and now they cause all the echoes of
            their melodious warblings to resound in concert. Not one remains silent; their musical
            songs, feeble at first, are more ten-der and sweet than during the remainder of the
            day—they seem as if tinged with the softness and mellow ness of a languid awakening.—
            Imitating their merry concerts, the insects hum beneath the grass ; the fishes in the
            streams dart along the surface of the water, and leap with jov, sparkling in the light
            with their silver scales; the reptiles crawl from their dark and humid holes, and come
            to bask in the warm sun-light ; and even the serpent himself, raising up his hideous
            head above his spiral coils, and darting out his scarlet longue, unable to sing praises
            hisses forth bis ceaseless curse ! Every thing, finally, is exci-ted and moved
            throughout all nature; every thing breathes joy and happiness at the first rays of the
            rising Sun—and the planets them-selves do they not bound forward in their empyreal
            course more rapidly and more animatedly as they approach him nearer and nearer in their
            perihelion?.....</p>

          <p>But to speak only of things more accessible to the observer; at his appearance the
            camel of the desert is said to kneel while turning himself towards the east; the eagle
            stretches broad his extended wings, while fixing his piercing eye upon his burning disc
            ; and the elephant salutes him with his flexible proboscis: or rather, do not all the
            animals salute in his image, by an irresistible impulse, in this universal concert and
            by these testimonials of respect and gladness, HIM of whom the Sun is but the shadow
            ?-the universal Father and Benefactor, above all empyreal suns ! And yet, “ although the
            con-course of all these objects carries to the sense an impression of fresh-ness which
            seems to penetrate even to the soul,” man alone, of all created beings, almost always
            forgets himself in presence of a spec- tacle so majestic and sublime! . . . . . . . </p>

        <p>Soon the laborers resume their wonted toils; the flocks and herds are reconducted to the
          fields; the butterflies begin to flit from flower<a href="#p300"/>
          to flower, the bees of the neighbouring trees come to dispute with them for the
          sweet ambrosia of their streaming nectaria ; the lady-birds leave their rosy couches ; the
          gilded day-beetles quit their pro-tecting recesses, while those of the night regain their
          mossy cells. The nocturnal flowers fold their humid petals, while the blossoms of the day
          unfold their fresh corollas. The dew evaporates beneath the increasing heat of the Sun,
          whose vivifying influence, animating all nature, infuses life, vigor, and gladness into
          every particle of matter, into every sensitive bosom.......</p>

        <div class="head">ANNIVERSARY WEEK.</div>
        <p>In addition to the usual religious societies which hold their anniversaries in this city
          during the second week in May, we have this season a convention of Infidels, whose
          meetings are held in a small brick building in Broadway called the Coliseum. The city was
          startled at the sight of placards on the corners of all the principal streets, headed
          Infidel Convention, notifying the people that a meeting of infidels would be held at
          certain hours during Sunday. We like the honesty of these people, in proclaiming their
          Infidelity, although it appears that the great man among them, Mr. Owen, objected to the
          term, and preferred being called, a “ friend of universal freedom and unlimited charity,”
          which is a very comprehensive designation, but not a very forcible one. The Tribune makes
          some strange comments upon this convention, which we do not fully comprehend, but they
          appear to us highly commendatory. “ Saying nothing of the influence of belief,” says the
          paper, “ who can doubt that the isolated condition of all infidels, their independence of
          the restraining influ-ence of sympathy and fellowship are clearly unfavorable to high
          moral attainments? We rejoice, then, that they have resolved to know each other, and fix
          upon some definite and endearing plan of organization and action.”</p>

        <p>This is surely very distinct and unequivocal. A paper possessing the immense circulation
          of the Tribune, which is taken in many pious families for the reason that it excludes
          theatrical advertisements, and other wicked matter from its columns, is rejoiced that the
          infidels in this country have had the shrewdness to adopt the machinery by which other
          classes of men contrive to strengthen themselves in their errors, and trusts that they may
          fix upon some plan for rendering their infidelity enduring. The want of “high moral
          attainments” among infidels, the Tribune attributes to the isolated manner in which they
          have heretofore lived, and thinks that by meeting together frequently, and adopting the
          machinery of a party, whereby they may become more thoroughly imbued with infidelity, that
          their morals will be improved. The morality and the reasoning of the Tribune are decidedly
          original, and we would advise the proprietors to get out a patent for them.</p>

        <p>It appears that Mrs. Rose, the somewhat celebrated clair-voyante, a Polish lady, who
          resides in this city, was among the speakers at the Coliseum, and that Judge Herttell was
          appointed chairman. The Tribune says that Robert Owen addressed the meeting briefly and
          sensibly, and of the convention it expresses the belief that “ an elevation of the aims
          and an improvement of the morals of many will be the consequence.” The Tribune, according
          to its manner of reasoning in the premises, would be rejoiced to see a convention of
          counterfeiters or pickpockets, or horse thieves, for the isolated manner in which these
          people live is very destructive to the social sympathies, and “ devotion to their party or
          sex, solicitude for us welfare, and pride in its respectability would make them behave
          better than they otherwise would.”</p>

        <p>The wisdom of conventions, even for professedly benevolent purposes, is very
          questionable, but there can be no question of the evil which must result from party
          machinery, being adopted by men whose sole object is to bind themselves in a compact of
          infidelity.</p>

        <p>No less than twenty-three different associations, mostly religious, have held their
          anniversaries during the week. Among the societies, we perceive one of a winning title,
          the “National Reform Association.” We should suppose that everybody would be anxious to
          enrol themselves among its members ; yet it appears that only twenty-five persons gathered
          together at its anniversary, which, after all, is about the number of men in the country
          who are favorable to National Reform. The Foreign Evangelical Society can number its
          thousands of members. Our Charity is not one  of the domestic virtues; she begins
          abroad, and, in many cases ends there.</p>

        <p>In New Haven there has been a grand gathering of Scientific Gentlemen during the last
          week, and much important information has been disseminated, and many curious discoveries
          made public. One of the members discovered a fossil pun, which seemed to afford the
          association a vast amount of pleasure, it being probably the first discovery of the kind
          ever made.</p>

        <p>Somebody gave an account of marks which had been found on a rock, resembling the human
          foot without toes, or a foot with the toes frozen off. Professor Silliman, junior remarked
          that it had long been a no-toe-rious fact.</p>

          With unkempt hair, and shoeless feet,
          The untitled sov’reign of the street,
          With broom in hand,
          Of charity may crave a mite,—
          Pass him not by, it is a sight He may command.
          Pass him not by without a sign,
          You recognize the shape divine In him, though poor;
          Kind words, if not a coin, will soothe,
          And make his rugged pathway smooth,
          More than before.
          Pass him not by ! Ye know not men,
          But God with his omniscient ken Has placed him there,
          To make his country’s annals bright,
          When the plebeian claims his right And spurns despair.
          Ay! ’neath that tattered, brimless hat,
          May rest a spirit great as that Which shook the world,
          And bent all Europe to its rod,
          While kings who ruled by grace of God,
          From thrones were hurled.
          A time may come when ’neath a sky,
          Brighter than that dark canopy,
          That shades him now;
          He yet may stand to clear your way,
          And pointing out a brighter day,
          Enwreathe his brow.
          The head now pillowing on a stone,
          Despised, uncared for, and lone,
          May one day rise,
          High plumed on its eagle wings,
          To sit above your sceptred kings,

        <div class="head">MUSICAL ITEMS.</div>

        <div>
            <div class="head">The Bcehm Flute.</div>
            <p>—We rarely have the good fortune to be able to chronicle one really useful improvement
            in musical instruments; numberless modern inventions come under our notice daily, but
            they are, for the most part, if not entirely, valueless—of but little practical
            advantage.</p>

            <p>The Boehm Flute is, however, a noble exception; we look upon it as the most valuable
            improvement ever effected in this instrument; and we believe, although there is no limit
            to the ingenuity of the human intellect, that it brings the flute as near perfection as
            it ever will be. It not only renders every scale of the instrument comparatively easy,
            but it ensures, beyond every contingency, that every scale shall be in perfect tune. It
            renders also the upper and the lower tones very easy to produce, while it improves and
            equalizes the tone throughout. Passages which were im practicable upon the old flute can
            be played with perfect fa<a href="#p301"/>
            cility upon the Boehm flute, while, added to all these advan-tages, and many
            more advantages which we shall take an early opportunity of pointing out to amateur and
            professional players, the exterior appearance of the flute is much improved and
            beautified.</p>

            <p>A strong feeling of prejudice was exhibited against the Boehm innovation, as it was
            arrogantly called, by professional players, both here and in Europe; but its striking
            advantages and sterling excellence silenced them one by one, and the Boehm flute is now
            universally adopted.</p>

            <p>To Mr. W. J. Davis, the talented flutist, every honor must be given as the first man
            who had the boldness to introduce it into this country ; and to Mr. Larrabee, the
            ingenious maker, the public and the professors owe a debt of gratitude for his sacrifice
            of self-interest, in substituting the new for the old flute.</p>

            <p>We hope that all who are interested in this subject, and have not yet examined the
            Boehm flute, may be induced by our notice to visit Mr. Larrabee’s factory, 110 Fulton
            street. We have examined the instrument thoroughly, and can vouch for its excellence in
            every way.</p>

            <div class="head">Grand Sacred Concert at St. Peter’s Church.</div>
            <p>—We call the attention of our
          readers to the advertisement of this Concert in our present number. It will be seen that a
          truly classical and yet popular programme is offered on this occasion. The selections are
          from the finest composers, ancient and modern. Mozart, Handel, Hayden, Mendelssohn,
          Rossini and other names of note, give warranty of the excellence of the selection. The
          solos and chorusses from St. Paul will be new to most of our readers. As an entire work,
          Paulus is un’ doubtedly the greatest work that Mendelssohn has yet produced; for, lofty
          sentiment, profound thought, and exquisite melody, no recent composition has approached
          it. The Loblgesang has also, only once been produced in this country, and the selections
          from it cannot fail to add the charm of novelty to the programme.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Edward Loder, Miss De Luce, Miss Schmidt, Miss Watson, and Mr. Masset sustain the
          principal parts, while the chorus, composed principally of the members of the New-York
          Vocal Society, so favourably known to the public, is announced to be full and effective.
          It will be under the direction of Mr. H. C. Watson.</p>

            <p>Mr. William A. King, organist of St. Peter’s, whose reputation in that department is
          widely spread throughout the States, is engaged to get the concert up. Mr. H. C. Timm
          performs with Mr. W. A King a four-handed piece for the organ.</p>

            <p>The Concert is for the benefit of the Funds of the Church, which, independent of the
          musical attraction will doubtless be sufficient to fill the Church.</p>

            <div class="head">THE BROADWAY THEATRE.</div>
            <p>Mr. Hamblin has made a very touching appeal to the citizens of New York, and proposes
          borrowing one hundred thousand dollars, in the ridiculously small sums (as Mr. Tigg would
          say) of one dollar, from the same number of individuals, for which he will issue scrip
          entitling subscribers to a dollar’s worth of admissions to his theatre when it shall be
          finished. This is certainly a very ingenious scheme for raising a hundred thousand dollars
          ; but without a particle of ill will towards Mr. Hamblin, whom we have not the pleasure of
          knowing, we cannot say that we wish he may get it. For we should regret exceedingly to see
          a theatre erected in Broadway, more especially such a theatre as Mr. Hamblin would
          probably put up. Considering the effect which thea-tres invariably have in the
          neighborhood where they have been built, we should expect that the owners of property in
          Broadway would protest against the erection of one in that noble thoroughfare. The little
          Olympic is probably the best conducted theatre in the city ; but we see it surrounded by
          dram shops, billiard rooms, and other equivocal resorts for  the profligate and idle.
          We see no necessity of making a theatre a drinking house, a gambling house, and a
          something else house, as well as a play house, but there seems to be the real unities of
          the drama, and pea-nuts and punch are as es-sential concomitants to the acting drama as
          tin foil and rouge. It is one of the strangest things in life, that every institution has
          been modified by time excepting the theatre. It is just as dissolute now as it was in the
          days of Charles the Second. Though governed by no laws, and its professors reckoned as
          vagrants, it is one of the most conservative institutions among us. Quakers and Jews
          change, but the theatre holds to its old usages. Mr. Simpson is the only man in New York
          who has remained unchanged during the past twenty years, and his theatre is the only
          building in the city which has not been renovated. All the churches have been remodeled;
          preachers have changed their style, their theology, and their habits; society has suffered
          a dozen revolutions; the whole order of living has been reversed; we have altered our
          food, drink, habits, and even our speech; cotillions have gone out, and the Polka has come
          in ; finger glasses and silver forks have become common in hotels; drunkenness has grown
          unfashionable; the national name has been changed; new streets have been built; Texas has
          been annexed; cheap books have been invented ; hanging is almost abolished; the Croton
          river runs through the streets ;—but Mr. Simpson and the Park remain the same, as
          unchangeable as the eternal sphinx of the desert. He looks as gloomy and saturnine as he
          used to look when he played Charles Surface in a claret colored coat and straw colored
          shorts ; and his theatre is as dingy, as English, and as expensive as ever. The filthy
          saloons, with their red moreen curtains and yellow refreshment sellers remain unchanged,
          and probably will remain so for the next century ; and the same plays are presented on the
          stage that were witnessed by our grandmothers and our grandmothers’ grandmothers. There is
          no church in Christendom half so conservative as the theatre: there are isms in every
          thing but the drama, which has never known a schism. Mr. Dinneford, to be sure, got up a
          Greek tragedy the other day, which was stepping backward a thousand years or two, instead
          of moving forward, as any one must do who would produce a sensation in the drama ; and it
          appears that he lost twenty-five hundred dollars by his devotion to the classics, which
          should be a caution to other managers to let the classics alone.</p>

            <p>We have no reason to believe that Mr. Hamblin would break adrift from the legitimate
          drama, or that he would do any better in Broadway than he has heretofore done in the
          Bowery; and therefore we would rather see him fail than succeed in his present
          undertaking; not that we wish him any ill as an individual, but as a manager he cannot but
          do harm in the community. He has had a large theatre under his control for many years, but
          he has done nothing to elevate the drama or correct the corrupt tastes of his audiences.
          If Mr. Hamblin must have a theatre, let him by all means stick to the Bowery. He would be
          a fish out of water in Broadway, and his theatre would mar the beauty of our magnificent
          thoroughfare.</p>

            <p>We shall have a theatre in New York by and by, we have no doubt, that will reflect the
          manners of the people and satirise their vices, but it must be under the control of a
          manager to the manor born.</p>

            <p>We are sorry for Mr. Hamblin’s misfortunes, and would not put the slightest obstacle in
          his way to retrieve his losses ; and our remarks are only intended to apply to the
          erection of a theatre in Broadway.</p>

            <div class="head">Fact and Fiction.—From Thoughts on Reading, in Colton’s Magazine, by H. N.
          Hudson, the Lecturer on Shakspeare:</div>

            <p>“Good people often seem laboring under a great mistake in regard to works of fiction.
          They appear to think of truth as synonymous with matters of fact, and of fiction as
          synony- mous with falsehood. Now, there is probably nothing that lies so frequently or so
          abominably as narratives of facts. Why, if a man wants to make any falsehood go down, he
          always sweetens it with some “ fact whch came under his own observation.” Facts, indeed,
          we know to be the readiest vehicle of lies in the world : and whenever one under- takes to
          inflict them on us, we take for granted that there is no truth in him; or that, if there
          be, it is not coming out this time. On the other hand, as some one has said, the purest
          fictions often contain more of truth than many histories and scientific theories. In
          Spenser or Cervantes, for example, perhaps you shall not find a single falsehood, or a
          single fact; in a Gibbon or a Paley, you shall scarcely find a single fiction or a single
          truth. In the former, all shall be true but the names; in the latter all but the names
          shall be false. Take, for example, Addison’s Cato and Sancho Panza. Now, Cato is
          unquestionably a real name; nobody doubts the existence of such a man ; or that he was a
          genuine old, eating, breathing, thinking and speaking Roman, of the staunchest and noblest
          make. But Addison's Cato is one of the sheerest falsehoods that ever was perpetrated ;
          such a being never did exist, and never could exist; all the princi- ples of human nature
          must be changed before his existence were possible. Sancho Panza, on the contrary, is
          doubtless a fictitious name; nobody pretends that a real man ever bore that name ; but the
          character is a perfect form of truth ; is as real as the old Roman Cato was, whom Addison
          meant to give us, but could not; wants, in short, all that Addison’s Cato has, and has all
          that Addison’s Cato wants. And thus it is, that, in the hands of an artist, a fiction
          becomes the truest of realities, while, in the hands of a bungler, a fact becomes the
          emptiest of falsehoods.</p>

            <p>Again ; take Spenser’s Una and Johnson’s Milton. Now, Una is a mere personification of
          truth—one of the purest abstractions which the mind can frame, and with which, as such, we
          could no more sympathize, than with a triangle or an octagon. And yet, in Spenser’s hands,
          it has turned out a fair humanity, breathing and blushing before us, like life itself.
          Uniting all the purity of an abstraction, with the flesh-and-blood reality of an actual
          person, we at once revere her as truth, and feel for her as the real subject of sympathies
          and affections answering to our own. Here, then, is a genuine character; a pure
          abstraction has come out a living person; a perfect fiction has become a perfect truth.
          This is the miracle that genius performs. Milton, on the contrary, is an actual person ;
          nay, he has stamped his individuality, as a full length portrait, on every page of his
          works, so that he who runs may read, provided he have eyes. In Johnson’s hands, however,
          he becomes a mere abstraction ; no longer he, but it ; or rather, a bundle of the mo t
          inconsistent and irreconcilable abstractions. You could no more mould such elements into
          the same living character, than you could mix fire and water, without destroying either.—
          Here is a genuine fact turned into a perfect falsehood. This is the miracle that genius
          does not perform. We could multiply instances beyond either our time or the reader’s
          patience. It is truth, in this sense, that forms the substance and the soul of all true
          books ; and we care not what form you give it, it is as genuine and as indestructible as
          the eye of God.</p>

              it was well attended, and the performances gave great satisfaction. Mr. Phillips sang
              twelve different ballads, scenas, &amp;c., many of which were encored, and all were
              well received. If he should repeat his visit to this country he would meet with better
              encouragement in the large cities on the Atlantic than he has done. His indifferent

              filled by the members of the Philharmonic Society of which he was a member, and by his
              personal friends and pupils. The funeral ceremonies, of which we shall give the

          Waverly Place, New York.</div>

               <p>THIS School differs essentially from most others in this city, in one particular: the
          number admitted is so limited that each scholar receives the personal attention and
          instruction of the principals.</p>

               <p>Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of qualifying himself
          as an instructor.</p>

               <p>The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France, and every
          facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.</p>

               <p>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course includes Grammar,
          Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic, with Composition. Reading aloud,
          Spelling and Definition, form part of the daily exercises of the whole school. </p>

               <p>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of Ancient and Modern
          History and the French Language.</p>

               <p>In the higher or AEsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-glish course of
          education are included, with French, German, Latin and Greek, according to the wish of the
          parent and the capacity of the scholar. </p>

               <p>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-position, and
          to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from Dymond, as abridged and
          prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures on various subjects are delivered by Mr.
          and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and the general course of study is advanced and rendered
          interesting by copious illustrations from French and English Literature.</p>

               <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work yet published in this country.
          Where pupils here used this method the most rapid advancement has been observed in all
          cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and
          studies, are given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
          carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise,
          are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when a
          superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study
          of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en abled to READ music with facility, and
          at the same time become good musi- cians.</p>

               <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-ments of music being
          given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson is fully explained by marginal
          notes on the same page.</p>

               <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from professional
          gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method over all others yet
          published in this country, most of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will
          only be necessary to give a few of the names in the principal cities.</p>

          Edition.</p>

               <p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to say much to
          their praise. As Literary organs, they stand far in advance of any works of a similar
          stamp now published, while their political complexion is marked by a dignity, candor, and
          forbearance not often found in works of a party character.</p>

               <p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory, and Radical.
          “Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly ” are Tory; the “ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the
          “ Westminster” Radical. The “Foreign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted
          principally to criticisms on foreign Continental Works.</p>

               <p>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign copies ; and
