         <div class="head">A Tale of the Ragged Mountains.</div>
         
         <p>During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young
            gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a profound interest
            and curiosity. I found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his age—although
            I call him a young gentleman— there was something which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed young—and he made a point of speaking about his youth—yet there were moments when I should have had little
            trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more
            peculiar than in his personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin. He stooped
            much. His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and
            low. His complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible, and
            his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however, was by no
            means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation whatever. It was
            one of profound melancholy—of a phaseless and unceasing gloom. His
            eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any
            accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such
            as is observed in the feline tribe. In moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected, but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun;
            yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy and dull, as to convey
            the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.
         </p>
         
         <p>These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and he was
            continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory, half apologetic strain,
            which, when I first heard it, impressed me very painfully. I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had
            not always been what he was—that a long series of neuralgic attacks
            had reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty, to that which I
            saw. For many years past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton—an
            old gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age—whom he had first encountered at
            Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit. The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Doctor Templeton, by which the
            latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the
            care of the invalid.
         </p>
         
         <p>Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and, at Paris, had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of Mesmer. It was
            altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very naturally
            inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however, like all
            enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his
            pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to submit to
            numerous experiments.— By a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen,
            which of late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention,
            but which, at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in America. I
            mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little
            by little, a very distinct and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond
            the limits of the simple sleep-producing power; but this power itself had
            attained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very
            partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the twelfth was the triumph
            complete. After this the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two, sleep
            was brought about almost instantaneously, by the mere volition of the operator, even
            when the invalid was unaware of his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious
            fact.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree, sensitive, excitable,
            enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous and creative; and no doubt it
            derived additional force from the habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed
            in great quantity, and without which he would have found it impossible to exist. It was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately after
            breakfast, each morning—or rather immediately after a cup of strong coffee, for
            he ate nothing in the forenoon— and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog,
            upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward
            and southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title of the Ragged Mountains.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon a dim, warm, misty day, towards the close of November, and during the strange
            interregnum of the seasons which in America is termed the Indian Summer Mr.
            Bedloe departed, as usual, for the hills. The day passed, and still he did not
            return.
         </p>
         
         <p>About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his protracted
            absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and in rather more than
            ordinary spirits. The account which he gave of his expedition, and of the events
            which had detained him, was a singular one indeed.
         </p>
         
         <p>“You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the morning when I left
            Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately to the mountains, and, about ten,
            entered a gorge which was entirely new to me. I followed the
            windings of this pass with much interest.— The scenery which presented itself on all
            sides, although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an indescribable, and to me, a delicious aspect of dreary desolation. The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not help believing that the
            green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod, had been trodden never before by the
            foot of a human being. So entirely secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except
            through a series of accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means
            impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer—the very first and sole
            adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.
         </p>
         
         <p>“The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt,
            to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. So dense was this
            pleasant fog, that I could at no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me. This path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen,
            I soon lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed. In the meantime the
            morphine had its customary effect— that of enduing all the external world with an
            intensity of interest. In the quivering of a leaf—in the hue of a blade of
            grass—in the shape of a trefoil—in the humming of a bee—in the gleaming of a dew-drop—in the breathing of the wind—in the faint odors that came from
            the forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a gay and motly train of
            rhapsodical and immethodical thought.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the mist deepened around me to so great an extent, that at length I was reduced to an
            absolute groping of the way. And now an indescribable uneasiness possessed me—a species of nervous hesitation and tremor.— I feared to tread, lest I
            should be precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too, strange stories told about
            these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce races of men who tenanted
            their groves and caverns. A thousand vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted
            me—fancies the more distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was
            arrested by the loud beating of a drum.
         </p>
         
         <p>“My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was a thing unknown. I
            could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump of the Archangel. But a new and still more astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of
            a bunch of large keys— and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man
            rushed past me with a shriek. He came so close to my person that I felt his hot
            breath upon my face. He bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had
            he disappeared in the mist, before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its character. It was a hyena.
         </p>
         
         <p>“The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my
            terrors—for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking
            consciousness. I stepped boldly and briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes. I called
            aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and
            here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate
            the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.
         </p>
         
         <p>“At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive closeness of the
            atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a tree. Presently there came a feeble gleam
            of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely
            upon the grass. At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes. Its character stupified me with astonishment. I looked upward. The tree was a
            palm.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation—for the
            fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw—I felt that I had perfect
            command of my senses—and these senses now brought to my soul a world of novel
            and singular sensation. The heat became all at once intolerable. A strange odor
            loaded the breeze.— A low continuous murmur, like that arising from a full, but
            gently-flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of
            multitudinous human voices.
         </p>
         
         <p>“While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need not attempt to
            describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as if by the
            wand of an enchanter.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down into a vast plain,
            through which wound a majestic river. On the margin of this river stood an
            Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a
            character even more singular than any there described. From my position, which was
            far above the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook and corner, as
            if delineated on a map. The streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than
            streets, and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly picturesque. On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandahs,
            of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels. Bazaars abounded; and
            in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and profusion—silks,
            muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides
            these things,
            were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately
            dames close veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums,
            banners and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion—amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing beard, there
            roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and shrieking, about the
            cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming
            streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps
            leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with
            difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide
            encumbered its surface. Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent
            majestic groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and wierd trees of vast
            age; and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary graceful
            maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the magnificent river.
         </p>
         
         <p>“You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I saw—what I
            heard—what I felt—what I thought —had about it nothing of the unmistakeable
            idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously self-consistent. At first,
            doubting that I was really awake, I entered into a series of tests, which soon
            convinced me that I really was. Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and
            the sleeper is almost immediately aroused.— Thus Novalis errs not in saying that ‘we are near waking when we dream that we dream.’ Had the vision
            occured to me as I describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a
            dream it might absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and
            tested as it was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr. Templeton, “but proceed.
            You arose and descended into the city.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of profound
            astonishment, “I arose, as you say, and descended into the city. On my way, I fell in
            with an immense populace, crowding, through every avenue, all in the same
            direction, and exhibiting in every action the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that I had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what it was. Against the crowd which environed me, however, I experienced a deep
            sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous
            path, reached and entered the city. Here all was the wildest tumult and contention. A
            small party of men, clad in garments half-Indian half European, and officered by
            gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were engaged, at great odds, with the swarming
            rabble of the alleys. I joined the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons
            of a fallen officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity of
            despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to seek refuge in a
            species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves, and, for the present, were secure.
            From a loop-hole near the summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river. Presently, from an upper window of this palace, there descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the
            turbans of his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he escaped
            to the opposite bank of the river.
         </p>
         
         <p>And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining over a few of
            them to my purpose, made a frantic sally from the kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before us. They
            rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we were borne far
            from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of
            tall overhanging houses, into the recesses of which the sun had never been able to
            shine. The rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harassing us with
            their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very
            remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of the Malay.
            They were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An instantaneous and deadly sickness seized me.
            I struggled—I gasped—I died.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“You will hardly persist now,” said I, smiling, “that the whole of your adventure
            was not a dream. You are not prepared to maintain that you are dead?”
         </p>
         
         <p>When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from Bedloe in reply; but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became fearfully
            pallid, and remained silent. I looked towards Templeton. He sat erect and rigid
            in his chair—his teeth chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets.
            “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.
         </p>
         
         <p>“For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment—my sole feeling—was
            that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness of death. At length,
            there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through my soul, as if of
            electricity. With it came the sense of elasticity and of light. This latter I
            felt—not saw. In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no
            bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. The crowd had departed. The tumult
            had ceased. The city was in comparative repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with
            the arrow in my temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these
            things I felt—not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had none, but
            appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the city, retracing
            the circuitous path by which I had entered it. When I had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains, at which I had encountered the hyena, I
            again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery; the sense of weight, of volition,
            of substance, returned. I became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly
            homewards—but the past had not lost the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an instant, can I compel my understanding to regard it as a
            dream.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. Let us suppose only,
            that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves with this supposition. For the
            rest I have some explanation to make. Here is a water-colour drawing, which I should
            have shown you before, but which an unaccountable seniment of
            horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it of an extraordinary
            character; but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious. He nearly fainted as he
            gazed. And yet it was but a miniature portrait—a miraculously accurate one, to be sure—of his own very remarkable features. At least
            this was my thought as I regarded it.
         </p>
         
         <p>“You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture—it is here, scarcely
            visible, in this corner— 1780. In this year was the portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend—a Mr. Oldeb—to whom I became much attached at
            Calcutta, during the administration of Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years
            old.— When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous
            similarity which existed between yourself and the painting, which induced me to
            accost you, to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this
            point, I was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the
            deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless curiosity
            respecting yourself.
         </p>
         
         <p>“In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the Indian city of Benares, upon
            the Holy River. The riots, the combats, the massacre, were the actual events of
            the insurrection of Cheyte Sing, which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of his life. The man escaping by the string of
            turbans, was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in the kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of this party I was one, and did all I
            could to prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Bengalee. That officer was my
            dearest friend. It was Oldeb. You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the
            speaker produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been freshly
            written) “that at the very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills,
            I was engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home.”
         </p>
         
         <p>In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs appeared in a
            Charlottesville paper.
         </p>
         
         <p>“We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus Bedlo, a gentleman
            whose amiable manners and many virtues have long endeared him to the citizens of
            Charlottesville.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has
            often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only as the mediate
            cause of his decease. The proximate cause was one of especial singularity. In an
            excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the head.
            To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical bleeding. Leeches were applied to
            the temples. In a fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared
            that, in the jar containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then
            found in the neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small artery
            in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech
            caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late.
         </p>
         
         <p>“N. B. The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be distinguished from the
            medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially by its writhing or vermicular
            motions, which very nearly resemble those of a snake.”
         </p>
         
         <p>I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the topic
            of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it happened that the
            name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I presume,” said I, “you have authority for this spelling, but I have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end.”</p>
         
         <p>“Authority?—no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error. The
            name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew it to be spelt
            otherwise in my life.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then indeed has it come to
            pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction—for Bedlo, without the e, what
            is it but Oldeb conversed? And this man tells me it is a typographical
            error.”

         <p>Great is the power of Music over a people! As for us of America, we have long enough
            followed obedient and child-like in the track of the Old World. We have received
            her tenors and her buffos, her operatic troupes and her vocalists, of all grades and
            complexions; listened to and applauded the songs made for a different state of
            society—made, perhaps, by royal genius, but made to please royal ears likewise; and it is time that such listening and receiving should cease. The
            subtlest spirit of a nation is expressed through its music—and the music acts reciprocally upon the nation’s very soul. Its effects may not
            be seen in a day, or a year, and yet these effects are potent invisibly. They enter
            into religious feelings—they tinge the manners and morals—they are active even in the choice of legislators and high magistrates. Tariff can be varied
            to fit circumstances—bad laws obliterated and good ones formed—those enactments
            which relate to commerce or national policy, built up or taken away, stretched
            or contracted, to suit the will of the government for the time being. But no human power can thoroughly suppress the spirit which lives in national lyrics, and sounds in the favorite melodies sung by high and
            low.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are two kinds of singing—heart-singing and artsinging. That which
            touches the souls and sympathies of other communities may have no effect here—unless
            it appeals to the throbbings of the great heart of humanity
            itself—pictures love, hope, or mirth in their comprehensive
            aspect. But nearly every nation has its peculiarities and its idioms, which make its
            best intellectual efforts dearest to itself alone, so that hardly any thing which
            comes to us in the music and songs of the Old World, is strictly good and
            fitting to our own nation.
         </p>
         
         <p>With all honor and glory to the land of the olive and the vine, fair-skied
            Italy—with no turning up of noses at Germany, France, or England—we humbly demand
            whether we have not run after their beauties long enough.
         </p>
         
         <p>“At last we have found it!” exclaimed we, some nights since, at the conclusion of the performances by the Cheney Family, in Niblo’s Saloon. At last we
            have found, and heard, and seen something original and beautiful in the way of American musical execution. Never having been present at any of the
            Hutchinsons’ Concerts, (the Cheneys, we are told, are after the same token,) the elegant simplicity of this style took us completely by surprise, and our gratification was inexpressible. This,
            said we in our heart, is the true method which must become popular in the United
            States—which must supplant the stale, second-hand, foreign method, with its flourishes, its ridiculous sentimentality, its antirepublican spirit,
            and its sycophantic influence, tainting the young taste of the republic.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Cheney young men are such brown-faced, stoutshouldered fellows as you will see in almost any American church, in a country village, of a
            Sunday. The girl is strangely simple, even awkward, in her ways. Or it may
            possibly be that she disdains the usual clap-trap of smiles, hand-kissing, and
            dancing-school bends. To our taste, there is something refreshing about all this. We
            are absolutely sick to nausea of the patent-leather, curled-hair,
            “japonicadom” style. The Cheneys are as much ahead of it as real teeth are ahead of
            artificial ones—even those which Dodge, (nature-rival, as he is,) sent to the
            late Fair. We beg these young Yankees to keep their manners plain alway. The sight of
            them, as they are, puts one in mind of health and fresh air in the country, at
            sunrise—the dewy, earthy fragrance that comes up then in the moisture, and touches
            the nostrils more gratefnlly than all the perfumes of the most ingen: ious
            chemist.
         </p>
         
         <p>These hints we throw out rather as suggestive of a train of thought to other and
            more deliberate thinkers than we—and not as the criticisms of a musical connoisseur. If they have pith in them, we have not much doubt others
            will|carry them out. If not, we at least know they are written in that true wish for benefitting the subject spoken of, which should characterize all such essays.

            <p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of American Books. No. 7. Western Clearings. By Mrs.
               C. M. Kirkland, Author of “A New Home" etc.
            </p>
            
            <p>Very few American books have produced as widely extended a sensation
               as Mrs. Kirkland’s “New Home.”— The cause of this lay not merely in its picturesque
               and amusing descriptions, its fresh and racy humor, or its animated individual
               portraitures. It was the truth of its delineations that constituted its great
               charm. The West —the wild, rich, independent, glorious West—has been a field
               hitherto untrodden by the sketcher or the novelist. Some few brief glimpses of
               character we had, strange to sojourners in the civilized East, in the works of
               other writers; but to Mrs. Kirkland alone we owe our acquaintance
               with the home and home-life of the backwoodsman. She has represented scenes that could have occurred nowhere else, with a fidelity and vigor that show her pictures taken from the very life; with a fine chisel that cut
               breath itself, she has placed before us the veritable settlers of
               the forest, with all their peculiarities, national and individual; their free and fearless spirit, their homely, utilitarian views; their shrewdness, and sharp looking out for self-interest; their thrifty care, and
               inventions multiform; their coarseness of manner, united with real delicacy
               and substantial kindness, when their sympathies are called into action; in a word, with all the characteristics that stamp the “Yankee,” in a region
               where the salient points of character are not smoothed down by contact with society, as an original creation among men.— So life-like, or rather so living, have been the representations of Mrs. Kirkland, that they have
               not only been recognized universally abroad, but appropriated at home as
               individual portraits, by many who have been disposed to plead trumpet-tongued, if
               not like angels, against what they imagined "the deep damnation of their taking
               off." This was to be expected, and inevitable.
            </p>
            
            <p>It will readily be seen that a minute and truthful picture of Western life could never be given in any grave history half so well as in the form of stories, where the persons are suffered to develope
               themselves. This method has been in part adopted by Mrs. Kirkland, in her former
               sketches of Forest Life; and more entirely in the present volume. “Western
               Clearings” is a collection of graphic Tales, each illustrative of the customs,
               manners and ideas of a peculiar people, and descriptive of a new and uncivilized, but great and growing country. We can only glance at a few
               of these. “The Land Fever,” is a story of the wild days when the madness of speculation in land was at its height. Both it, and “The Ball at
               Thram’s Huddle,” are richly characteristic.— Only those who have had the fortune to
               visit or live in these newly settled regions, can enjoy such pictures to the full. “Chances and Changes,” and “Love vs. Aristocracy,” are more
               regularly constructed Tales, with the “ universal passion” for the moving power,
               but colored with glowing hues of the West. “The Bee-tree” exhibits a striking,
               but too numerous class among the settlers, and marks, also, the length and breadth
               of the bitterness that grows out of an unprosperous condition.
            </p>
            
            <p>“Ambuscades,” and “Half-lengths from Life,” we remember as the most
               piquant and delightful of the stories in an annual a year or two since, to which
               the book owed, according to the confession of the publishers, a large sale
               among the conscious and pen-dreading Western people themselves. Tom Oliver, in
               the first mentioned Tale, is admirably sketched “Half-lengths from Life,” has the
               heart’s core and spirit of a backwoods life, on the trying subject of caste. “The Schoolmaster’s Progress,” is unrivalled in truth and humor. The Western Schoolmaster—that walking nondescript—that stiff,
               solitary, unique figure in the drama of a new settlement—sublimely mingled with the associations of our school-days—occupying a middle
               position between “our folks” and “company,” where he “boarded round”—is depicted to
               the very life. The individual cannot fail to be recognized as the representative of a class. The occupation, indeed, always seems to mould those engaged in it into the same likeness. They all, like Master
               Horner, “know well what belongs to the pedagogical character, and that facial
               solemnity stands high on the list of indispensable qualifications.” The spelling school, also, is a new country feature which we owe thanks to our fair author for recording. How important that such good old
               customs should be preserved on the speaking page, when hereafter
               they may lose their peculiarity, if they be not effaced from the memory, in the
               march of improvement!
            </p>
            
            <p>“An Embroidered Fact,” is a narration of actual events, described to the author by
               the hero himself. We like it less than the other stories. The incidents are
               singular— but not illustrative of the country. The same may be said of the
               tragic occurrences in “Bitter Fruits from Chance-sown Seeds but this last abounds
               in capital touches of character. All the horrors of the Tale are caused by the
               suspicion of pride; an accusation, says the author, as destructive at the West as
               that of witchcraft in olden times, or the cry of mad dog at the present day.
            </p>
            
            <p>“Western Clearings,” we are confident, will sustain the author’s high reputation
               as one of the most original and accomplished of American writers. Even her style
               has a touch of Western freshness that renders it, and her arch, playful satire, especially charming. The imaginative or creative faculty is
               possessed by Mrs. Kirkland in a high degree; but she is unrivalled in power of delineation; and in a marvellous felicity of expression, whereby
               a world of meaning or humor is convey ed in some brief phrase, she is
               approached by no female writer in the country.

            <div class="biblTitle">America and the American People</div>
            <div class="biblPage">320</div>
            
            <p>America and the American People. By Frederick Von Raumer, Professor of History in
               the University of Berlin, etc, etc. Translated from the German by William W. Turner. New-York; J. &amp; G. H. Langley.
            </p>
            
            <p>We cannot better preface the few words we have to say of this book than by the
               citation of a passage in Professor Turner’s introduction.
            </p>
            
            <p>His opinions on the whole respecting the institutions, the past history, and the
               future prospects of this country, are in the highest degree favorable ; and
               whenever he allows himself to find fault, which is but seldom, he does it with
               evident reluctance, and with the air of a friend whose admonitions are wholesome,
               not with the bitterness of an enemy. The comparisons too, which he makes
               between many of the American institutions and the corresponding institutions
               of Europe, will be found useful and instructive. One virtue of his will not be the
               less esteemed on account of its rarity among writers in this country; and that is, that he has at least endeavored to make himself well acquainted with what he has undertaken to write about. He has also shown great and
               commendable carefulness in every instance, not to violate the privileges of a guest
               by
               exposing to the world the confidences of private and social in- tercourse,--a proceeding
               which some writers on both sides of the water might imitate with advantage.
            </p>
            
            <p>Elsewhere the translator well observes that it is rather the
               subjectivity than the objectivity of the book that will claim the attention of
               readers in this country
               —that Americans will not resort to a work of this kind, written by a foreigner, and which treats of such a variety of delicate and
               different topics, to obtain minute information on matters of fact.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Baron himself, with a genuine modesty, admits that he is not unaware of his
               incapacity for such detail. “Should my book reach America,” he says, “I request
               my readers there not to forget that it is especially intended for
               Germany and that it can offer nothing new to the well-informed inhabitants of the
               United States.”
            </p>
            
            <p>These considerations and admissions should be carefully borne in mind
               by every American who reads the book. Its commendable features are candor, evident desire for truth, freedom from prejudice, comprehensiveness, and masterly breadth of generalization.
            </p>
            
            <p>Perhaps there are no points at which we have greater need of making allowance for
               the foreigner’s imperfect means of information in detail, than those which concern
               the state of our National Literature. Were we to say, in round terms, that
               Professor Von Rammer has set forth with accuracy not one fact in relation to
               American letters, we fear that we should not be very far from the truth. The
               German who is so rash as to estimate our condition by what he here reads, will find
               himself in what may be termed a high state of information.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The greater American periodicals or critical reviews” says the
               Baron, among other things, “distinguish themselves by propriety, moderation, and
               dignity; they display an accurate knowledge of all sciences and often contain
               criticisms which are masterly both in form and substance.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Of the “propriety” we are not prepared to speak— and the “dignity” will do—but the
               “moderation” (so far at least as concerns the Down-East Review) must have
               reference to the applause or attention bestowed upon those insignificant
               indivduals who have the misfortune to reside out of the limits of
               Massachusetts.
            </p>
            
            <p>“Authors of really able productions” continues the Baron, “are liberally rewarded
               in America.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Some one has informed the traveller, no doubt, that Mr. Prescott received six
               thousand dollars for “The Conquest of Mexico”—for this is the one brilliant point
               usually cited in defence of the liberality of American publishers. Had the
               Professor made farther inquiry he would have found that Mr. Prescott was engaged
               for many years at his work, and that he expended for the necessary books and
               other materials a large sum:— the compensation thus afforded him, amounting in the
               end to little more than any common scavenger might have earned in the same
               period, upon our highways.
            </p>
            
            <p>The most really curious portion, however, of the comments on American Literature, is to be found in the following passage:</p>
            
            <p>The richest or at least the most prolific department of poetry is the lyric. But
               as in thousands of years there have been but one Pindar and one Horace, (although every spring puts forth countless pleasing yet mostly perishable lyric
               blossoms,) it is performing a valuable service, when a man of taste and information
               makes a suitable, well assorted selection, and guides the friend of poetry in
               his ramble through those groves, from which he might otherwise be deterred by
               their immensity. Such service has been rendered by Mr. Griswold, in his Poets and
               Poetry of America.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have heard it asserted that it was out of the power of any such
               book as that of Mr. Griswold to effect either good or evil—but we think that the
               evil is here sufficiently obvious. His book is the largest one of its kind. A
               distinguished foreigner very naturally supposes it the best. He is not in condition to consider or to comprehend the innumerable petty arts by which, in America, a dexterous quack may force even the most contemptible work into notoriety and consequent circulation. The foreigner’s
               opinions, and through him the opinions of his countrymen, are thus in danger of
               being based (at least for a time) upon a foundation, for which “frothy” is far
               too solid—far too respectable a term. If Dr. Griswold’s book is really to be received as a fair representation of our poetical literature, then are
               we in a very lamentable—or rather in a very ridiculous condition
               indeed.
            </p>
            
            <p>Following such authority, Professor Von Raumer quotes in especial, “The Old Man’s
               Carousal” by Paulding! and a lyric (the name of which we forget) by the Right
               Reverend Bishop Doane!
            </p>
            
            <p>We have been much surprised to find, in the Translator’s Preface, no
               acknowledgment of his indebtedness to those who aided him in his very difficult
               task—to Mr. Kirkland, for example, and to the accomplished Mrs. Ellett—who,
               between them, prepared nearly, if not quite, one half of the book. The omission,
               however, may either have been accidental or have arisen from some motives of
               publishing policy—motives which, we admit, are now and then exceedingly difficult to understand.

            <p>The Philosophy of Mystery. By Walter Cooper Dendy, Fellow and Honorary Librarian of the Medical Society of London, etc. etc. New York: Harper and Brothers.</p>
            
            <p>This really beautiful volume is No. 3 of Harper’s New Miscellany. The style of
               this series is especially good; the type is of proper size, the paper unusually
               fine, and the binding (in boards, with embossed muslin,) particularly neat and
               tasteful. The number of pages in a volume is about 450. In literary character, the books of this series will tend towards the utile rather than the
               dulce— combining the two as far as possible.
            </p>
            
            <p>“The Philosophy of Mystery” is an exceedingly able work—far better, we think, than
               the “Natural Magic” of Brewster—a book of identical purpose carried out in a
               totally different way. The “Natural Magic” is the more ratiocinative—Mr.
               Dendy’s essay the more poetical, the more imaginative, and to us the more interesting. Seldom, indeed, have we read any book which, for the
               time, so thoroughly engrossed us.

            <p>This is a re-print of the best of two British translations —and is the first
               American edition. A prefatory discourse on European affairs, is very properly
               omitted.
            </p>
            
            <p>The style of this “Tour” is particularly French—there is no other word for the
               idea. We find a great deal of point, vivacity, wit, humor, archness, novelty—the
               whole pervaded and “toned down” by a delicious simplicity.— It is not as a tourist, however, or as a sketcher, that Victor Hugo is most
               remarkable. His essays in this way are scarcely better than those of fifty other
               Frenchmen—but as a builder of brief fictions he is unequalled among his
               countrymen—very far surpassing, we think, Eugene Sue. His “Notre Dame” is a
               work of high genius controlled by consummate art.

            <p>This will assuredly prove to the public a very acceptable collection.
               Few Americans have attained so much of celebrity as has “Fanny Forrester,” in so
               brief a time. Some of her fame is, beyond question, due to the kindly and
               frequent notices of Mr. Willis, but the greater portion of it springs from
               intrinsic merit—from the vivacity and talent of the author. She is one of our best
               Magazinists the very best in her way—and her way would be admirable in all respects but for a slight taunt of Willisism. Not that we object to
               Willisism—in Willis.
            </p>
            
            <p>We quote a portion of the Preface:</p>
            
            <p>About a year ago, a girl sat down in her own quiet little room, and, for very
               idleness, without object and without plan, produced plan, produced a letter, which,
               the next week, found its way into the New York Mirror. It was the first letter in
               this collection; and Mr. Willis, one of the editors, after various speculations concerning the author, added—
            </p>
            
            <p>“Well—we give in!—On condition that you are under twentyfive, and
               that you will wear a rose (recognizably) in your boddice the first day you appear
               in Broadway with the hat and 'balzarine,' we will pay the bills. Write us,
               thereafter, a sketch of 'Bel' and and yourself, as cleverly done as this letter, and you may 'snuggle down' on the sofa, and consider us paid, and the
               public charmed with you.”

            <p>A reply was given by way of carrying out the frolic still father, accompanied by
               the sketch of “The Cousins,” which appeared in the Mirror immediately after. These met with such a kind reception, that the pen became a more familiar
               thing than formerly in those fingers, and so, behold upon them an indelible
               ink-mark.

            <p>“The Sibyl’s Wreath.—In this very pretty little volume we have found more real fun
               than all the games we have yet seen.— It is well got up, and deserves the patronage
               of every family in the Union.”

            <p>The intention, of course, is that we shall adopt this opinion as editorial—as our

            </p>
            
            <p>We have no such opinion. The book is contemptible at all points, and we should be
               sorry to recommend it to "every family in the Union." What would “every family in the Union” think of us, if, upon looking into a book at our
               recommendation, “every family in the Union” should find the detestable vulgarity

            <p>Love and stewed oysters.</p>

            <p>We scarcely know what to say of this narrative—so as to recommend it with sufficient positiveness to our readers. Undoubtedly it is one of the
               most interesting books ever penned. “Robinson Crusoe” is not better as a composition, and here we have the additional charm of truth —a truth
               that cannot be doubted, and which, the tone of narration assures us, is not
               exaggerated in any degree.

               by Dick, from a painting by Allom— the subject a Chinese Raree-show—also a good mezzotint by Sadd. Its contributions are of more than average
               merit. The number opens with “A Remembrance” by Mrs. Osgood—touching and
               graceful. There are articles, also, by Mrs. Child, Mrs. Sigourney, Fanny Forrester,
               Wm. Kirkland, Park Benjamin, John Brougham, and others of note. “Lake Michigan

            <p>Simms’ Magazine, Graham, Godey, The Illustrated, The Western, The Southern Messenger,and the Southern Quarterly Review, have all been received
               and shall be noticed next week—until when, also, we must defer what we have to
               say of the Annuals— some of which (The Missionary Memorial, for example, The
               Rose, The Diadem, and the Mayflower) are of a very high order of excellence. We have on hand for immediate notice Mrs. Osgood’s Poems—Mr. Cist’s.—The Pilgrim’s Progress (Illustrated edition.)—The Sufferings
               of Christ—and The Whiteboy, a Story of Ireland—the three last from the fertile
               press of the Harpers.

            <br></br>Fancy too assumed the helm,
            
            <br></br>And the ship of thought drove far,
            
            <br></br>O’er the dream-sea’s mystic realm,—
            
            <br></br>Thou, the sole and guiding star!
            
            <br></br>Wilt thou hear me sing the scenes
            
            <br></br>Mirrored in that Eden sleep—
            
            <br></br>Unto thee my spirit leans,
            
            <br></br>Enchantress, for the meaning deep!
            
            <br></br>I.
            
            <br></br>First, within a brilliant hall.
            
            <br></br>’Mid the youthful, gay, and bright,
            
            <br></br>Glanced a form more fair than all,
            
            <br></br>Like a spirit on my sight!
            
            <br></br>Proudly through the circling dance,
            
            <br></br>As, between the stars, the moon,
            
            <br></br>Moved she, with a stately glance,
            
            <br></br>To the old and festive tune.
            
            <br></br>Sweet the music,—for it seemed
            
            <br></br>But her motion’s atmosphere,—
            
            <br></br>Filled with light that round her beamed,—
            
            <br></br>Captivating eye and ear.
            
            <br></br>Thoughts, like fountains years-subdued,
            
            <br></br>In my bosom poured their tide,
            
            <br></br>And, entranced like Saul, I stood,
            
            <br></br>Mute with homage at her side!
            
            <br></br>II.
            
            <br></br>Months seemed passed,—and now a scene
            
            <br></br>Pastoral-sweet was round me spread;—
            
            <br></br>On the hills, the spring-time’s green,
            
            <br></br>And the blue sky overhead!
            
            <br></br>Winding down a forest river,
            
            <br></br>In a lightly-leaning boat,—
            
            <br></br>Snowy sails in breezy quiver,
            
            <br></br>By her side I seemed to float.
            
            <br></br>Music from her voice was breathed,
            
            <br></br>Sweeter than a singing bird’s;
            
            <br></br>Smiles around her lips were wreathed,
            
            <br></br>Like the starlight of her words.
            
            <br></br>Long we sailed,—and passion’s sighs
            
            <br></br>Kneeling then, I dared to pour,—
            
            <br></br>But a storm o’erwhelmed the skies!
            
            <br></br>I was wrecked upon the shore!
            
            <br></br>III.
            
            <br></br>Fancy now more wild became!
            
            <br></br>Far through foreign lands I roved,
            
            <br></br>Armed,—a knight,—in lists of fame,—
            
            <br></br>Championing my Ladye-Love.
            
            <br></br>Pomp and splendor round me shone,
            
            <br></br>Cavaliers and maidens bright,—
            
            <br></br>But above them all was one
            
            <br></br>Beautiful as morning light!—
            
            <br></br>On my shield her scroll I bore,—
            
            <br></br>Fairest Virgin op the West,—
            
            <br></br>Round my breast her scarf I wore,
            
            <br></br>And her colors in my crest.
            
            <br></br>Shouting loud defiance out,
            
            <br></br>Sought I then the marshalled strife,—
            
            <br></br>Proudly with the boldest fought,—
            
            <br></br>Perilling with joy my life!
            
            
            <br></br>Soon a victor, from the scene
            
            <br></br>To her feet I bore the prize,—
            
            <br></br>Crowned her there as Beauty’s Queen,—
            
            <br></br>Drank my plaudits from her eyes!
            
            <br></br>IV.
            
            <br></br>But a change now strangely passed
            
            <br></br>O’er my wild and fevered dream;—
            
            <br></br>Where tall trees their shadows cast,
            
            <br></br>By a sweet, secluded stream,
            
            <br></br>We were roving;—overhead,
            
            <br></br>Smiling like an angel’s face,
            
            <br></br>Hung the moon, as if to shed
            
            <br></br>Love-light on that trysting place.
            
            <br></br>In the shadows and the hush
            
            <br></br>Of that old, moon-silvered grove,—
            
            <br></br>Prayer, and vow, and tear, and blush!—
            
            <br></br>Plighted we our troth and love!—
            
            <br></br>What beside this then occurred
            
            <br></br>Underneath that smiling sky,
            
            <br></br>Thou must ask that startled bird!—
            
            <br></br>Thou must dream as well as I!
            
            <br></br>Such my visions yesternight,—
            
            <br></br>So my spirit roved with thine,—
            
            <br></br>Drinking in a wild delight,—
            
            <br></br>Revelling ’mid scenes divine!
            
            <br></br>Strange indeed our dreams are wrought;
            
            <br></br>Fancy, Memory and Hope,
            
            <br></br>All combine to cheat the thought
            
            <br></br>With their gay Kaleidescope!
            
            <br></br>What within my dream was drawn
            
            <br></br>From the Past, thy heart can tell;
            
            <br></br>What was Fancy’s work alone,
            
            <br></br>Thou canst see and solve as well.
            
            <br></br>But our dreams are Sibyls too;—
            
            <br></br>Could we read their visits right,
            
            <br></br>We might in their lessons view
            
            <br></br>Stars to guide the Future’s night.
            
            <br></br>Then, enchantress, solve the scenes
            
            <br></br>Mirrored in my last night’s sleep!
            
            <br></br>Unto thee my spirit leans,
            
            <br></br>Belshazzar-like, for meaning deep.

         <p>First Concert of the Philharmonic Society.—The Overtures and Symphonies were
            certainly performed in a style worthy of the Philharmonic Society, and we tender
            our thanks to the government thereof, for thus interrupting the
            musical drowsiness which prevailed ever since the last concert of this Society. Madame Lazarre’s playing was exquisite, though a slight nervousness
            could be perceived during the whole performance of the very difficult composition. Mrs. Mott acquitted herself well, and Mr. Wollenhaupt was so
            scared that it would not be doing him justice to make any comments on his performance.
         </p>
         
         <p>A full notice of Ole Bull’s Concert, on Wednesday last, will be found in our
            next.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Huber, the celebrated Violincellist, gave a Musical Soirée on
            Tuesday evening last. We found a most brilliant array of ladies, and a most
            interesting party of gentlemen. Ms. Huber favored us with some of his choicest
            compositions; and nothing we could say would be enough to express their beauty, and
            the artistical style in which they were performed. He was accompanied on the Piano, by his sister, and many a complete professor could yet learn of
            her. Mrs. Mott sang some very beautiful airs with her usual good grace; and Mr.
            White, an amateur, sang a bass-solo very respectably.— We feel assured
            that Mr. Huber’s concerts will be attended by the elite of New-York.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Templeton’s Concert at the Tabernacle.—Although the price of the
            tickets was only 50 cents, a most fashionable audience greeted this charming vocalist
            with their cheers, and the desire was universally expressed, that
            he might repeat his entertainment as soon as possible.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Delcy Troupe, we believe, are not quite as successful as the placards in the street try to make one believe. The performance of Lucia
            di Lammermoor was as good a specimen of musical murder as we have witnessed.
         </p>
         
         <p>The German Opera.—Der Freischutz is to be the first performance, and Mr. Rapetti
            will lead the orchestra.— If properly managed, it will be a profitable
            enterprise.
         </p>
         
         <p>A New system of musical notation for the Blind has been invented. We shall speak at
            length of it at some future opportunity.
         </p>
         
         <p>Ole Bull has invited the pupils of the Institution for the Blind to his last
            Farewell Concert.
         </p>
         
         <p>Homans &amp; Ellis have published some of De Meyer’s compositions.</p>
         
         <p>We heard some of the best singing at Dr. Potts’ church, on Sunday last.</p>
         
         <p>An Oratorio, composed by an American, will be brought out soon, in this city. We
            hope it will be more successful than the American Grand Opera.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Mott, assisted by Mr. Kyle, intend giving a series of Concerts at Boston.</p>
         
         <p>Ole Bull sails positively on the 1st of December, for Havre. We are really anxious to hear what his old acquaintances in Europe will say of his
            playing.
         </p>
         
         <p>Miss Northall.—This lady gives a concert at the Apollo, on the fourth of December. In addition to the attraction of her own voice—no small attraction by
            the bye —she has obtained the assistance of Sig. De Begnis and Mr. Timm.

            great houses, and with brilliant success.

            letter to the Charleston Courier, in sneering at dramatic and musical performers:
            compares, in a most exceptionable spirit, the Philadelphia audiences to
            bourgeois, and thinks to be an American actor “is’nt much,” &amp;c. We doubt whether the able and gentlemanly conductor of that print, or any body else,
            egrees with him in that.

         <p>The Delcy engagement, at the Park Theatre, has proved a failure. The organization of the company is inefficient, but the best we imagine
            it was in the power of the management to command.

         <p>Mr. Hudson’s new Lectures at Boston, (Lear and Othello,) have attracted
            a great deal of attention, and have been very successful with the audiences to which
            they have been delivered.

            hear no more croaking from that quarter.
         </p>
         
         <p>We copy the subjoined passage from “Wilmer &amp; Smith’s European Times.” The
            observations are so plainly just as to need not a word in the way of comment:
         </p>
         
         <p>A Boston publication, called ‘Littell’s Living Age,’ has found its way to this city,
            and is advertised in our newspapers, though it consists of nothing but pilfering from
            the English magazines and reviews. It may also be met with in one or two cabinets de
            lecture, frequented by the English and Americans. Pirated editions, or if you
            prefer the phrase, reprints, of the works of Scott, Bulwer, Dickens, and other
            eminent authors, are imported into France in great numbers from America, and, from
            the lowness of their price, meet with a ready sale. There are one or two English
            circulating libraries in this city entirely stocked with American reprints. The
            injury this causes to the authors and proprietors of the works is incalculable.
            At one time a brace of publishers here carried on a roaring trade by reprinting all the works that issued from the English press, and smuggling them into
            England for the circulating libraries; one of these honest men actually became
            enriched from his wholesale piracies on Walter Scott alone.
         </p>
         
         <p>But a law lately passed, directing the immediate destruction of every pirated work, has put a considerable check on their conscientious trade; and it now
            appears that they find it more profitable to import from the United States than to
            reprint. Belgium preys with a voracious audacity on French literature,—not a work can
            be published here that is not brought out there, and sold all over the Continent
            infinitely cheaper than French publishers, who have authors to pay, can afford. The
            publishers of M. Thiers’ Histore du Consulat et de l' Empire has been cruelly
            victimized by those Belgian pirates. He has paid somewhere about ₤20,000 for the
            copyright of the work, and has sold some 30,000 copies. The Belgians have not paid one single farthing for copyright, and have sold 100,000 copies. It is a burning and scandalous shame to governments of such
            enlightened countries as America, England, France and Belgium, that a law of literary copyright is not established.

         <p>The Mirror says:</p>
         
         <p>Americans.—An address delivered before the Eucleian Society of the New-York University, June 30, 1845, by Cornelius Mathews. We published the address in the Mirror soon after its delivery. We could not understand
            it then, and cannot now.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Mathews, we should judge, punctuates his manuscript with a pepper-box. We like
            his thoughts better than the idiosyncrasies of his style. He should reform it
            altogether.
         </p>
         
         <p>Whatever, in the opinion of the worshippers of Britain and everything
            British, may be objectionable in the matter of Mr. Mathews’ address, its manner, at
            least, is simple and unaffected, and we are quite at a loss to discover anything incomprehensible in any portion of the essay. There is a good saying
            of Dr. Johnson’s, about the extreme unfairness of requiring an author to supply
            at once thought and brains for its comprehension.
         </p>
         
         <p>We do not intend to claim the honor of originating in the Journal the exquisite poem, by Halleck, now pub
            lished. It is not included, however, in any edition of his poems.
            Independently of the high intrinsic merit of the piece, there is a tale about it—a
            romantic tale—which we could unfold, if we thought proper, and which to certain readers will give it additional interest.

         <p>In these days of peace and political fusion, the Revolution and the Empire in France are, as we have seen, gradually comcompleting their unfinished
            monuments. Fifty years after the first proposal of the project by the celebrated
            painter David, and its adoption by the Convention, the city of Lille has been
            celebrating the anniversary of the memorable siege which it sustained in 1792,
            by the inauguration of a monument, consisting of a granite column, surmounted by
            a bronze statue represnting the city of Lille. The spirit of the occasion, and of its
            proceedings, our readers know enough of their gallant neighbours the French to have
            no difficulty in conceiving. Thirty-nine towns and communes of the northern part
            of France were represented by deputations of their national guard; St. Cyr and the
            Polytechnic Schools sent representatives; and the army contributed a delegate of each rank from every regiment. An old gunner of 1792, caught amongst them in
            the midst of their excitement, had the dangerous honours of an ovation on the
            shoulders of his fellow-citizens: and Louis Phillippe, who knows his countrymen
            better than any of us, or of themselves, contrived with his matchless tact, to
            sympathise in the feeling of the hour, after a fashion identifying his own royal
            attributes with its republican bias. In his name, the Mayor of Lille, amid the tumultous acclamations of the crowd, presented to M. Scheppers, the sole
            surviving member of the municipality of Lille, at the period of the siege, the
            “Star of the Brave,” as the latter called it in the figurative mood of the
            occasion—“one of the finest episodes of the day,” say the highly excited journals of
            the department.—London Athenaum.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is an amusing sight, and enlivening withal, to look at the rows of white tents,
            the beautiful girls and their elegant dresses, the crowds of spectators, each
            sheltered by a bright coloured umbrella, and some thirty or forty ladies and
            gentlmen, fat and thin, tall and short, old and young, in the water together, dipping
            and spluttering, shouting and shrieking, as the white-crested wave rolls towards
            them—some attempting to swim, others, fearful of being caried out to sea,
            clinging to their attendants’ arms, and endeavoring to make their escape to terra
            firma. Here an old woman bearing aloft a little cherub, independent of any costume,
            to dip it a due number of times—there a bathing girl encouraging a stout old
            gentleman to venture into the water, after he has received the first souse on the
            head from the contents of a bason, to prevent his feeling the effect of the
            shock to his feet. Sometimes three or four young ladies will go in together, or a
            gentleman may be seen leading gallantly some fair one of his acquaintance: but
            everything is conducted with the strictest propriety and decorum; so that however
            extraordinary the style may appear at first to a stranger, he soon becomes accustomed
            to it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most amusing scenes have passed, never to recur, when the friars came down to bathe. Some years ago there was an enormously fat friar, who was ordered
            to take a certain number of baths at a certain hour in the morning, and it was the
            general amusement to go down and see him perform the ceremony. He had ten persons
            to attend him, six men who stood on the shore holding ropes attached to his
            waist (for he had conscious of his own floating qualities, a most pious horror of
            being washed away), and four women who accompanied him into the water. When they got
            him there with a proper solicitude for his health, they took good care to make him perform his ablutions abundantly. While the men slackened the rope,
            they used to dip him and duck him most unmercifully, pressing his head down with
            their hands, like the merry wives of Windsor packing Sir John Falstaff into the
            clothes-basket. He dared not resist, for fear they should leave him to his fate, and
            they would not let him out till he had taken the prescribed number of dips—he
            spluttering, and crying, and praying and swearing all the time. Now and then,
            though seldom, the same scene is enacted with a stout artizan, or a country
            farmer.—Lusitawan Sketches.

            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>“We have seen many quartos, not taken either from the lowest rank of dullness,
               with far less that is acceptable in them.”—Dem. Review.
            </p>
            
            <p>“We commend this volume to the lover of true poetry, and can say, in all sincerity, if Mr. Hoyt, in his following numbers, sustains the
               character of this, there is no doubt of his success.”—N. Y. Evening Mirror.
            </p>
            
            <p>“It is printed in a very neat and even elegant style, worthy of the grace,
               delicacy and beauty of the poems.”—N. Y. Courier and Enquirer.

            <p>“He writes with grace, taste and genius, and many of his productions

            <p>"The Chaunt is one of the finest modern poems that we have read this many a day,
               and abounds in highly wrought and beautiful passages. The author, Rev. Ralph Hoyt,
               is destined to a high rank in the American temple of poetry, and we heartily thank
               him for providing us such a rare poetic feast as he has given us in this

            </p>
            
            <p>“Part II. contains the second canto of a very fine poem,—the Chaunt of Life: From
               the first stanza we quote three remarkably beautiful lines. The fourth and fifth
               stanzas are very noble.— The poem Old has so many rare and peculiar excellences,
               that we shall venture to copy it in full.”—Broadway Journal.

            <p>“The Chaunt of Life is like the opening of some glorious ma jestic
               strain of music, through which the mournful spirit of the past gives tone and
               unutterable earnestness to the aspirations of the present and the hopes of the
               future. Such strains as those of our author will be heard. They sink at once into
               the heart and abide there."—Prot. Churchman.

               I
               performed on at the St. George’s Society Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch,
               and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your
               Harps The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument.
               Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN. A pupil of N.C. Boscha.

            <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:--Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action
               Harps, I find they possess the best qualities of the first makers in
               Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is
               obtained, in perfection and ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have
               used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
               Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced
               in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure in recommending your Harps at
               every opportunity.

            <p>“Praed was the Poet of Society, ‘a fellow of infinite humor,’ and in scholarship
               and art, surpassed by none of the English poets of the age. Though many ol his pieces have been almost universally read in this country, they have never yet been printed collectively, either here or in

            <p>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office 446 Houston St., two doors from
               Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’ Church.
            </p>
            
            <p>Doct. S’s experience and skill in his profession, give him confidence
               in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Dentist in this city. Dr.
               S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has
               brought him many difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
               of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the same
               operation were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth is to
               supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth, both in regard to
               utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appearance. In all these points, Doct S.’s manner is preeminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled
               him to I surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
               generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the
               best materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has fallen away by
               absorption, (which is always the case, more or less, when teeth have been
               extracted,) which causes a contraction of the lips and checks, the disfigurement of
               which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums, which
               will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, render detection impossible.
            </p>
            
            <p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of the best families
               in this City, in which he has practised.

            <p>*Caution. —Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare the Hyson tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article that the Company offer at
               the same price. The difference is so perceptible on trial as to render any further
               comment unnecessary.
            </p>
            
            <p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be retailed by small dealers,
               in this country, at 75 cents per pound, because they frequently cost that money in
               China, and no Importer in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a
               less price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
               Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in which he saw the
               lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated leas,
               and deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them above
               suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents per
               pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No
               one, it is presumed, wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
               giving full details on this subject, which may be had at their Warehouse, 75
               Fulton street, free of charge.

            <p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one dollar per pound for
               it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea from them at 75
               cents per pound. We drink one pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen
               dollars per year, and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin

            <p>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, have
               imported into this market some five hundred thousand dollars worth of the finest
               grades of Green and Black Teas grown in the Celestial Empire, done up in all the
               various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy
               teas at this great establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them They sell
               good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants who wish to

            <p>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all lovers of pure
               and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors enables us to
               bespeak for them the entire confidence of the public. We know that their Teas, both
               in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant
               herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea in consequence of its
               injurious effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
               the imported varieties of Tea in our market a kind which had not such an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed. The Pekin
               Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of
               most delicious flavor-cultivated and picked with great care, which have heretofore
               never been introduced into this country, except as presents to importers. Among
               these they have, an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we
               especially recommend to all nervous persons, Its effect upon many of those who have
               tried it, has been to make them confirmed tea drinkers. Ladies who have used it,
               say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes can here he suited, with the
               great advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The Company’s Warehouse is at 75 Fulton
               street.— New World.
