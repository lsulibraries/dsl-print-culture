            <br></br>I saw thee in thy tender, youthful bloom;
            
            <br></br>Ah! many then there were who loved thee well,
            
            <br></br>And in thy joy, and grace,
            
            <br></br>And loveliness rejoiced.
            
            <br></br>Years since have passed, charged with what freight of gloom!
            
            <br></br>How art thou changed! pale, woe-worn, hopeless, sad—
            
            <br></br>Amid the dismal wreck
            
            <br></br>Lives nought but cold Despair!
            
            <br></br>And thou repinest that thou stand’st apart,
            
            <br></br>Like the tree lightning-blasted; wrung with pain
            
            <br></br>No sympathy can heal,
            
            <br></br>No time can e’er assuage.
            
            <br></br>That life to thee is but a sea of woe,
            
            <br></br>Where deep unto its deep of sorrow calls,
            
            <br></br>While others walk a maze
            
            <br></br>Of flowers, and smiles, and joys!
            
            <br></br>Look up, thou lone and sorely stricken one!
            
            <br></br>Look up, thou darling of the Eternal Sire!
            
            <br></br>More blest a thousand fold
            
            <br></br>Than they, the idly gay!
            
            <br></br>For them earth yields her all of bliss; for thee
            
            <br></br>Kind heaven doth violence to its heart of love;
            
            <br></br>And Mercy holds thee fast,
            
            <br></br>Even in her iron bonds;
            
            <br></br>And wounds thee, lest thou ’scape her jealous care;
            
            <br></br>And her best gifts—the cross and thorn—bestows.

            <br></br>Where fruits and flowers abound;
            
            <br></br>Those on Affliction’s high and barren place;

         <p>ON Saturday last, a couple of friends and myself determined to
            leave the City with its noise and distraction for a quiet walk
            through some of Nature’s gentle scenes. Sincerity, a love for the
            country, and a spirit of enjoyment, the power of extracting good
            and beauty from the simplest objects, are all that are required in
            a companion for a rural walk. I was doubly rich in my two
            friends. The one, a young lawyer, was glad enough to escape
            from the drudgery of a toilsome profession. His looks brightened
            up, good talk flowed freely from his lips, his step was buoyant 
            and triumphant, and his cane came down with a ringing sound,
            as we walked through the lovely City of Brooklyn. He was
            humming “Begone dull care.” He is one of those, whose qualities of head and heart but few of his acquaintance appreciate,
            for they sink into an absorbent ground of modesty and quiet
            manners. He is truthful, has a well regulated mind, he loves a
            beautiful landscape and house and grounds, has good taste, is
            gentlemanly, plays on several instruments skilfully, and sings
            well—enjoys a good story, and will tell an effective one in return. He laments that the happy days of his boyhood have
            passed away, and speaks with rapture of his Saturday holiday
            enjoyments, when life’s mere and breathing charm, was sufficient
            for his comfort. The other of my companions has written much,
            clearly expressed, and with a large portion of bland, heart-easing
            philosophy. He is very agreeable, notwithstanding he stutters
            somewhat in his eagerness to be delivered of his good sayings.
            He has a few choice books, with which he is thoroughly imbued.
            There is nothing narrow in his taste. He relishes Hooker, and
            is an admirer of John Buncle. He reads novels and sermons, and
            finds both admirable. He goes to theatres, concerts, and churches,
            and finds them all interesting and instructive. He sometimes indulges himself in imitating Methodist preachers in a stentorian
            voice and with uplifted eyes, in a capital style and with great
            unction. A ranting actor he does to the life. He loves and is
            beloved by children; a sure test of his amiability. He is a great
            admirer of Hazlitt, and is alive to the merits of Steele and Addison. He has an old beautiful copy of Walton’s Angler which
            he cherishes lovingly. The names of Rubens and Vandyke
            sound pleasantly in his ear. He shakes hands heartily in a manner which plainly says, “My dear boy, I am heartily glad to see
            you.” Then comes sincere talk, and you hear spoons tinkling in
            tumblers, and some old Brandy or Jamaica appears blushingly on
            the scene, and then for a walk. He has good sense, a correct
            taste, and a straight-forwardness of head and heart which are as
            rare as they are delightful. He ought to have a fortune aad
            keep open house all the year; it would snow meat and drink.
            He sees God’s goodness in the tiny flower and in the giant oak.
            He conceives life to be a blessing, and talks not of the sinful
            flesh. If there were more of his nature in the world, society
            would improve faster than it does.
         </p>
         
         <p>The morning was clear, the air pure and bracing, and we
            went briskly on our winding way. The sun shone brightly
            through the few remaining leaves that still clung to the gray
            branches; their brethren that had once sparkled with them in
            green beauty, when they were refreshed by summer showers,
            now lay piled in heaps by the road side, and rustled to our tread.
            On the top of one of the hills we had an extensive view of Brooklyn, the Narrows, Staten Island, the Jersey shore, and New York;
            and in the opposite direction the ocean with its melancholy waste
            melted into the sky. Some sheltered fields were still covered
            with a tender green. At length, when we reached Flatbush, there
            was an exclamation of delight from us all. The houses look
            like homes, the abodes of quiet and contentment. They give
            one a perfect idea of cleanliness and comfort. A Sabbath silence
            brooded over the whole scene. The city, with its cares, and crimes
            and pains, was forgotten. We were boys again. A walk through
            Flatbush is delightful, for each side of the path is lined with
            trees, and it is serpentine. If it looks like fairy land in November, it must be a bower of bliss in “the leafy month of June.”
            In front of one of the inns, we saw an old weather-beaten sign,
            a lion rampant: we liked the looks of it better than we did those
            of its newer and glossier neighbors. We went in, and there
         </p>
         
         <div class="cit">
            <span class="quote">Arrangement neat, and chastest order reign.</span>
            <div class="bibl">—Young.</div>
         </div>
         
         <p>Not a speck of dust was to be seen. Woman’s care, and taste,
            were everywhere visible. We were waited upon by a young
            woman, neatly attired, and well bred. We determined to dine
            there, and when the dinner was prepared we were shown through
            rambling rooms to an apartment that we judged to be the sittingroom of the females of the family. It was well warmed, a canary bird was bathing himself in the warm sunshine—there was a
            piano in the room, and a painting, most likely of sisters, with
            sweet eyes and rosy lips was hung over it; there was also an
            old-fashioned side-board, and the same scrupulous neatness. The
            dinner was excellent and would have sharpened the most fastidious appetite. After the meal was dispatched, a polite, goodlooking girl procured the key of the piano, and the young lawyer
            made it discourse most eloquent music—the tones sank into the
            heart, and harmonized with file quiet and orderly spot in which
            we were; the sun shed a golden tinge on some vine-leaves by
            the window, and the garden paths looked as if the broom had
            just passed over them. We felt a delicious repose
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>A wise man never will be sad;
            
            <br></br>But neither will sonorous bubbling mirth,
            
            <br></br>A shallow stream of happiness betray—
            
            <br></br>Too happy to be sportive, he’s serene.
         </div>
         
         <p>After luxuriating till warned by the gloaming to depart, we bid
            a kind adieu to our fair entertainers and set our faces towards
            home. Our way was cheered with conversation about our pleasant ramble, our delicious fare, and the inn, that we all insisted
            on never was, and never could be surpassed. The shades of
            evening surrounded us before we reached Brooklyn; the air was
            still; not a sound was heard, save
         </p>
         
         <p>The watch-dog’s voice that bay’d the whispering wind.</p>
         
         <p>Arrived home, we rejoiced that the day had passed so happily.</p>
         
         <p>Prosperity to Flatbush, and the inn with the sign of the lion-
            rampant.

         <p>THE Baron Ritzner Von Jung was of a noble Hungarian family,
            every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any
            certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent
            of some description,—the majority for that species of grotesquerie
            in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given
            some vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications.
            My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent
            Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be
            made public, threw me during the summer months of the year
            18—. Here it was I obtained a place in his regard, and
            here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his
            mental conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear,
            as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close;
            and when, after three years separation, we met at G—————n, I
            knew all that it was necessary to know of the character of the
            Baron Ritzner Von Jung
         </p>
         
         <p>I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I
            remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by
            all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the world,”
            no person made any attempt at accounting for this opinion. That
            he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But, letting
            this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from
            the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons
            purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded
            him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the
            same time the most indefinitive and altogether unaccountable.
            Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an
            era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people
            appertaining to it or its dependencies as “that very extraordinary
            epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.”

         <p>Upon his advent to G——————n, he sought me out in my apartments. He was then of no particular age;—by which I mean
            that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any
            data personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty,
            and was twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no
            means a handsome man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of
            his face was somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was
            lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy,
            glassy and meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be
            observed. The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one
            upon the other after such fashion that it is impossible to conceive
            any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravitysolemnity and repose.
         </p>
         
         <p>It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,
            that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then
            to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and
            the business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of
            mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his projects into
            effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——————n, during that
            renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the
            Baron Ritzner Von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery
            which overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person
            at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected
            him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog
            at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of
            Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.
            This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities, and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly
            through his intermediate agency or connivance. The beauty, if
            I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate
            ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human
            nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of
            which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries
            he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite,
            and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good
            order and dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the
            overwhelming mortification which, upon each such failure of his
            praiseworthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his
            countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity
            in the bosoms of even his most sceptical companions. The adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the
            created—from his own person to the absurdities to which he had
            given rise. In no instance before that of which I speak, have I
            known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of
            his manoeuvres—an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person. Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of
            whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society;
            and not even his own household have for a moment associated
            other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory
            of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.
         </p>
         
         <p>During the epoch of his residence at G—————n it really appeared
            that the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon
            the university. Nothing at least, was done, beyond eating and
            drinking, and making merry. The apartments of the students
            were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pothouse of them all more famous or more frequented than that of
            the Baron. Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and
            long, and never unfruitful of events.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly
            daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk.
            The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the
            Baron and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of
            high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra
            German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions
            some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal recontres at G——————n, had given new vigor and
            impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of
            the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the times.
            The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the
            earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused
            from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt
            upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the
            received code of etiquette in passages of arms, with an ardor, an
            eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner,
            which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general,
            and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be
            at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended,
            and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette
            in the sovereign contempt which it deserves.
         </p>
         
         <p>Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse,
            (of which, my readers may gather some faint idea when I say
            that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical, sermonic manner of Coleridge,) I perceived
            symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party. This gentleman, whom I shall call
            Hermann, was an original in every respect—except, perhaps, in
            the single particular that he was a very great fool. He contrived
            to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some
            logical talent. As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even
            at G———n. I forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands; but they were many. He was a man of courage undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute acquaintance with
            the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor,
            that he most especially prided himself. These things were a hobby which he rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past
            afforded food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not
            aware; although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend,
            and that Hermann was its especial object.
         </p>
         
         <p>As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue,
            I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At
            length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon
            by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment)
            and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm
            and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his
            teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago
            of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember. “Your
            opinions, allow me to say, Baron Von Jung, although in the
            main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself
            and to the university of which you are a member. In a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would
            say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you offence (here the speaker smiled blandly,) I would say, sir, that
            your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman.”
         </p>
         
         <p>As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were
            turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red,
            then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,
            when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be
            seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I
            had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, 
            and when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he
            stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of!
            countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before,
            For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and I
            that he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with
            passion, and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time
            he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion.
            Having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter
            which stood near him, saying, as he held it firmly clenched—
            “The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer
            Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so
            many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specification. That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be
            expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive
            as to allow me but one line of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself,
            at this moment, as my guest. You will pardon me, therefore, if,
            upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage
            among gentleman in similar cases of personal affront. You will
            forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of
            your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. I
            shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder
            mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence
            to your real person will be obviated.”
         </p>
         
         <p>With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against
            the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the
            reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once
            started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and Ritzner,
            took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make
            of so ridiculous a piece of business.
         </p>
         
         <p>The duellist accepted my aid with his usual stiff and ultra
            recherché air, and taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could
            hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to dicuss,
            with the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly peculiar character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome
            harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his bookshelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,
            and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading
            aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance
            of Philip le Bel on Single Combat;” the "Theatre of Honor,"
            by Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by Andiguier. He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s
            “Memoirs of Duels,” published at Cologne, in 1666, in the types
            of Elzevir—a precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a
            fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested my attention particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a
            thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having the quaint title, “Duelli Lex scripta, et non;
            aliterque. From this he read me one of the drollest chapters in
            the world concerning “Injuriæ per applicationem, per construe,
            tionem, et per se,” about half of which, he averred, was strictly
            applicable to his own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not
            one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the life
            of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and de-
            manded what I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I
            had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and
            would abide by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed
            flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:
         </p>
         
         <p>SIR,—My friend, M. P——, will hand you this note. I find
            it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an
            explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers, In
            the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to
            arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps preliminary to a meeting.
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">With sentiments of perfect respect,
            
            <br></br>Your most humble servant,
            
            <br></br>Johan Hermann.
         </div>
         
         <div class="ab">To the Baron Ritzner Von Jung,
            
            <br></br>August 18th, 18—.
         </div>
         
         <p>Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with
            this epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he
            wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">SIR,</div>
         
         <p>Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your
            note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the
            propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted,
            I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature
            of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my
            part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as
            to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows
            of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that extreme
            delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of
            etiquette, for which you have been so long and so preeminently
            distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my
            own, to refer you to the opinions of the Sieur Hedelin, as set
            forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of “Injuriæ per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,'' in his “Duelli Lex
            scripta, et non; aliterque.’’ The nicety of your discernment in all
            the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this
            admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for explanation.
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">With sentiments of profound respect,
            
            <br></br>Your most obedient servant,
            
            <br></br>Von Jung.
         </div>
         
         <div class="ab">The Herr Johan Hermann.
            
            <br></br>August 18th, 18—.
         </div>
         
         <p>Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,
            which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous
            self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuria per
            applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be
            seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself,
            then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron Von Jung his exalted
            sense of his chivalrous behaviour, and, in that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most
            honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.
         </p>
         
         <p>Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron.
            He seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of
            course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to
            an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “Duelli
            Lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” He handed me the volume and
            asked me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little
            purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.
            He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud.
            To my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons. He now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima
            facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du
            Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so
            as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility,
            and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning
            existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every
            second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series
            of ludicrous quizzes upon single combat as practised in modern
            times.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely
            thrown the treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before
            the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor
            of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.
            Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have die! a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand
            anything and everything in the universe that had ever been
            written about the duello.

            <br></br>And birds sang blithe in bower and tree,
            
            <br></br>And flowers sprang up and bloomed between
            
            <br></br>Low branches and the quickening lea.
            
            <br></br>The greenness of the leaf is gone,
            
            <br></br>The beauty of the flower is riven,
            
            <br></br>The birds to other climes have flown,
            
            <br></br>And there’s an angel more in Heaven.

            <p>The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. First American Edition (Complete); with some remarks on the Poetical Faculty, and
               its influence on Human Destiny. Embracing a Biographical
               and Critical Notice, by G. G. FOSTER, New York. J. S. Redfield, Clinton Hall.
            </p>
            
            <p>This is a very beautiful edition of a poet whom all poets, and
               whom poets only, appreciate. The volume is a pendant of the
               Carey’s Dante lately issued by D. Appleton &amp; Co., and includes
               750 pages duodecimo—fine type and exquisite paper. It is, as
               asserted, a complete edition of the works of the author—rather too
               complete, perhaps; for many of the Fragments are utterly destitute of intrinsic value, and have no other interest than what appertains to them as relics of Shelley. The Biographical and Critical Notice by Mr. Foster, is well written, (barring a little justifiable furore) and evinces a keen discrimination, and, very especially, a thorough appreciation of the excellences of the subject of
               the memoir. We shall be pardoned for copying some passages
               embodying Mr. Foster’s opinions on “The Revolt of Islam”
               and affording, also, a fair specimen of his style:
            </p>
            
            <p>The “Revolt of Islam,” although not admitted by the critics to
               be his grandest work, is, in the meaning I attach to poetry, altogether the most important. It is, as it were, the consummation of
               himself—the prophecy which he has uttered; and although it contained still more literary errors than have been charged upon it, yet
               in this view they would not detract from the importance of it. But
               these errors are, for the most part, mere distortions of the critics’
               brains, and do not deserve seriously to be alleged against a man who
               has shown his right to disregard the apparent and mechanical laws
               of poetry, by proving that he has held living communion with the
               source whence those laws have been attempted to be drawn. Autumn is a faulty colorist, by all the rules of Dilettantism—and yet
               we do not criticise, but admire her pictures. Language is at best
               but a dull instrument for Thought to work withal; and if Shelley
               has succeeded in producing, as a whole, deeper effects and more
               beautiful pictures than others, we will not quarrel with him because
               his instinct has developed rules of composition of which our critical
               scholarship happened to be ignorant: the great bard of Avon has
               been quite annihilated by the critics several times; and yet we have
               even forgotten their names, long ago, while we every day bring fresh
               worship to his altar—which bears not even a mark of all the critics’
               well-filed teeth that have ever nibbled at its base.
            </p>
            
            <p>The “Revolt of Islam” is written in twelve cantos of Spenserian
               stanzas, and was at first to have been called “Laon and Cythna.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Bold as it is in many of the sentiments, it is a noble monument to
               the loftiness of his aims, the brilliancy of his imagination, the
               wealth of love in his heart, and the breadth and power of his intellect It is an armory from which the young enthusiasts of many
               generations to come may draw their weapons, in the assurance that
               they are of tried temper and exquisite polish. We have never read
               it without feeling our souls stirred within us as with the sound of a
               trumpet—it has enlarged our thoughts, expanded and warmed our
               affections, quickened our purposes of good, and filled us with an
               unquenchable flame of philanthropy and love. It is almost the only
               poem that we can read at all seasons. In those darker moments,
               when the sense of misdirected efforts, or the exhaustion of disease,
               or the dark and mysterious dread oi some future ill, weighs like an
               incubus upon the soul, it is almost the only work, after the gospels,
               that furnishes nutriment and solace to our mind. Then, it touches
               us with a feeling of universal sympathy. It awakens us to the
               broad, deep sorrows of the world, it quickens languid and lagging
               resolutiens, it confirms our faith in good, and swells our hearts with
               high and bursting hopes. Oh sweet, incomprehensibly sweet, are
               the emotions of intense and burning enthusiosm that it kindles!

            <p>Through neglect, discourtesy, or something else, on the part of
               somebody, or perhaps of Nobody—we have received no copy of
               this year’s Opal, and have no opportunity, therefore, of speaking
               of it in full. In glancing it over we find some very spirited
               contributions—by Mrs. Osgood, for example, Miss Lynch, Mrs.
               Mowatt, Mrs. Seba Smith, Mrs. Embury, Miss Gould, Tuckerman, Hoffman, Paulding, Schoolcraft, Whittier, and others. Our
               attention is especially arrested by Miss Anne C. Lynch’s

               <br></br>Where plgrims seek the Prophet’s tomb
               
               <br></br>Across the Arabian waste,
               
               <br></br>Upon the ever shifting sands,
               
               <br></br>A fearful path is traced.
               
               <br></br>Far up to the horizon’s verge,
               
               <br></br>The traveler sees it rise,
               
               <br></br>A line of ghastly bones that bleach
               
               <br></br>Beneath those burning skies.
               
               <br></br>Across it, tempest and simoom
               
               <br></br>The desert sands have strewed,
               
               <br></br>But still that line of spectral white
               
               <br></br>Forever is renewed.
               
               <br></br>For while along that burning track
               
               <br></br>The caravans move on,
               
               <br></br>Still do the way-worn pilgrims fall,
               
               <br></br>Ere yet the shrine be won.
               
               <br></br>There the tired camel lays him down
               
               <br></br>And shuts his gentle eyes,
               
               <br></br>And there the fiery rider droops,
               
               <br></br>Toward Mecca looks and dies.
               
               <br></br>They fall unheeded from the ranks:—
               
               <br></br>On sweeps the endless train,
               
               <br></br>But there to mark the desert path
               
               <br></br>Their whitening bones remain.
               
               <br></br>As thus I read the mournful tale
               
               <br></br>Upon the traveler’s page,
               
               <br></br>I thought how like the march of life
               
               <br></br>Is this sad pilgrimage.
               
               <br></br>For every heart hath some fair dream,
               
               <br></br>Some object unattained,
               
               <br></br>And far off in the distance lies
               
               <br></br>Some Mecca to be gained.
               
               <br></br>But beauty, manhood, love and power
               
               <br></br>Go in their morning down,
               
               <br></br>And longing eyes and outstretched arms
               
               <br></br>Tell of the goal unwon.
               
               <br></br>The mighty caravan of life
               
               <br></br>Above their dust may sweep,
               
               <br></br>Nor shout, nor trampling feet shall break
               
               <br></br>The rest of those who sleep.
               
               <br></br>Oh, fountains that I have not reached,
               
               <br></br>That gush far off e’en now,
               
               <br></br>When shall I quench my spirit’s thirst
               
               <br></br>Where your sweet waters flow?
               
               <br></br>Oh, Mecca of my life-long dreams,
               
               <br></br>Cloud-palaces that rise
               
               <br></br>In that far distance pierced by hope,
               
               <br></br>When will ye greet mine eyes?
               
               <br></br>The shadows lengthen towards the East
               
               <br></br>From the declining sun,
               
               <br></br>And the pilgrim, as ye still recede,
               
               <br></br>Sighs for the journey done.

            <p>Miscellanies, by WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT. New York: Harper &amp;
               Brothers.
            </p>
            
            <p>We said a few words, last week, of this admirable collection
               of essays, and now take the liberty of extracting some portion of
               the interesting paper on the genius of Brockden Brown:
            </p>
            
            <p>The explication of the mysteries of Wieland naturally suggests
               the question how far an author is bound to explain the supernaturalities, if we may so call them, of his fictions; and whether it is
               not better, on the whole, to trust to the willing superstition
               and credulity of the reader (of which there is perhaps store
               enough in almost every bosom, at the present enlightened day
               even, for poetical purposes) than to attempt a solution on purely
               natural or mechanical principles. It was thought no harm for the
               ancients to bring the use of machinery into their epics, and a similar freedom was conceded to the old English dramatists, whose
               ghosts and witches were placed in the much more perilous predicament of being subjected to the scrutiny of the spectator, whose
               senses are not near so likely to be duped as the sensitive and excited
               imagination of the reader in his solitary chamber. It must be admitted, however, that the public of those days, when the
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>Undoubting mind
               
               <br></br>Believed the magic wonders that were sung,
            </div>
            
            <p>were admirably seasoned for the action of superstition in all forms,
               and furnished, therefore, a most enviable audience for the melodramatic artist, whether dramatist or romance-writer. But all this
               is changed. No witches ride the air now-a-days, and fairies no
               longer “dance their rounds by the pale moonlight,” as the worthy
               Bishop Corbet, indeed, lamented a century and a half ago.
            </p>
            
            <p>Still it may be allowed, perhaps, if the scene is laid in some remote age or country, to borrow the ancient superstitions of the place
               and incorporate them into, or, at least, color the story with them,
               without shocking the well-bred prejudices of the modern reader.
               Sir Walter Scott has done this with good effect in more than one of
               his romances, as every one will readily call to mind. A fine example occurs in the Boden Glas apparition in Waverley, which the
               great novelist, far from attempting to explain on any philosophical
               principles, or even by an intimation of its being the mere creation
               of a feverish imagination, lias left as he found it, trusting that the
               reader’s poetic feeling will readily accommodate itself to the popular
               superstitions of the country he is depicting. This reserve on his
               part, indeed, arising from a truly poetic view of the subject, and
               an honest reliance on a similar spirit in his reader, has laid him
               open, with some matter-of-fact people, to the imputation of not
               being wholly untouched himself by the national superstitions. Yet
               how much would the whole scene have lost in its permanent effect
               if the author had attempted an explanation of the apparition on the
               ground of an optical illusion not infrequent among the mountain
               mists of the Highlands, or any other of the ingenious solutions so
               readily at the command of the thorough-bred story-teller!
            </p>
            
            <p>It must be acknowledged, however, that this way of solving the
               riddles of romance would hardly be admissible in a story drawn
               from familiar scenes and situations in modern life, and especially in
               our own country. The lights of education are flung too bright and
               broad over the land to allow any lurking-hole for the shadows of a
               twilight age. So much the worse for the poet and the novelist
               Their province must now be confined to poor human nature, without meddling with the “Gorgons and chimeras dire” which floated
               through the bewildered brains of our forefathers, at least on the
               other aide of the water. At any rate, if a writer, in this broad sun
               shine, ventures on any sort of diablerie he is forced to explain it by
               all the thousand contrivances of trap-doors, secret passages, waxen
               images, and other make-shifts from the property-room of Mrs. Radcliffe and Company.
            </p>
            
            <p>Brown, indeed, has resorted to a somewhat higher mode of elucidating his mysteries by a remarkable phenomenon of our nature.
               But the misfortune of all these attempts to account for the marvels
               of the story by natural or mechanical causes is, that they are very
               seldom satisfactory, or competent to their object. This is eminently the case with the ventriloquism in Wieland. Even where
               they are competent, it may be doubted whether the reader, who has
               suffered his credulous fancy to be entranced by the spell of the
               magician, will be gratified to learn, at the end, by what cheap mechanical contrivance he has been duped. However this may be, it
               is certain that a very unfavorable effect, in another respect, is produced on his mind, after he is made acquainted with the nature of
               the secret spring by which the machinery is played, more especially
               when one leading circumstance, like ventriloquism in Wieland, is
               made the master-key, as it were, by which all the mysteries are to
               be unlocked and opened at once. With this explanation at hand,
               it is extremely difficult to rise to that sensation of mysterious awe
               and apprehension on which so much of the sublimity and general
               effect of the narrative necessarily depends. Instead of such feelings,
               the only ones which can enable us to do full justice to the author’s
               conceptions, we sometimes, on the contrary, may detect a smile
               lurking in the corner of the mouth, as we peruse scenes of positive
               power, from the contrast obviously suggested of the impotence of
               the apparatus and the portentous character of the results. The
               critic, therefore, possessed of the real key to the mysteries of the
               story, if he would do justice to his author’s merits, must divest
               himself, as it were, of his previous knowledge, by fastening his
               attention on the results, to the exclusion of the insignificant means
               by which they are achieved. He will not always find this an easy
               matter.

            <p>The Poems of Alfred B. Street. Complete Edition. New York:
               Clark &amp; Austin.
            </p>
            
            <p>Most of the poems here included, are familiar friends, and we
               cordially welcome their re-appearance. A modest Preface says:
            </p>
            
            <p>The early life of the author was spent in a wild and picturesque region in the southwestern part of New York—his native state. Apart
               from the busy haunts of mankind, his eye was caught by the strongly
               marked and beautiful scenes by which he was surrounded: and to the
               first impressions thus made may be attributed the fact that his subjects
               relate so much to Nature and so little to Man. Instead, therefore, of
               aiming to depict the human heart, he has endeavored to sketch (however rudely and imperfectly) the features of that with which he was
               most familiar.
            </p>
            
            <p>These are the impulsive words of a true poet. Man is, in fact,
               only incidentally a poetic theme:—we mean the heart and intellect of Man—matters which the pseudo-transcendentalists of
               Frogpondium are perpetually attempting to force into poetry—
               with no other object than to impart to their doggrel an air of profundity.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Street’s subjects are invariably poetical ones—but they
               belong not to the loftiest order. They are descriptive altogether—
               not sufficiently ideal. Mr. Bryant seems to have been the model
               —although the Beauty of Nature may have been the inspiration.
            </p>
            
            <p>The volume is a very handsome octavo of 319 pages, and does
               credit to the taste and liberality of the publishers.

            <p>Hyperion, a Romance. By HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW.
               Second Edition, Cambridge: John Owen.
            </p>
            
            <p>This is one of the most tastefully printed books we have seen
               for many a year:—a thick duodecimo of 370 pages—delightful
               type, unusually good paper—well bound. The work itself is
               sufficiently well known. It has all Mr. Longfellow’s distinctiveness of thought and manner—is graceful, scholar-like, at times
               pointed, and always artistical, but neither original, nor very interestiing. Its tone is a palpable imitation of the German spirit. One
               of its marked peculiarities—and an idiosyncrasy, in fact, appertaining to all that the author does—is its entire want of suggestiveness. The book does not go beyond itself Mr. Longfellow’s
               works seem to some minds greater than they are, on account of
               their perfection of finish—on account of the thoroughness with
               which their designs are carried out. They exhaust limited subjects. His books are books and no more. Those of men of genius ate books and a dream to boot. These men do not exhaust
               their subjects, because their subjects expand with every touch.

            <div class="biblPage">387</div>
            
            <p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of American Books. No. 10. The
               Alps and the Rhine. By J. T. HEADLEY.
            </p>
            
            <p>This is one of the most entertaining books yet issued in the
               American series. The vivacity and blilliant fancy of Headley
               throw a charm over all his descriptions—a charm that has all the
               effect of novelty—if indeed it is not.
            </p>
            
            <p>A marked peculiarity of the author is the Irishy abandon or
               neck-or-nothingness of his manner. He writes as if he held it a
               sin to keep us waiting a moment—either for grammar or any
               thing else.
            </p>
            
            <p>“I have never felt” says his Preface “the need of stronger
               Saxon more than when standing amid the chaos of an Alpine
               abyss or looking off from the summit of an Alpine peak. Like
               the attempt to utter a man’s deepest emotions, words for the time
               shock him.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Why “off?”—is not “from” enough? The “summit of a
               peak” is something, we presume, like the end of an extremity.
               As for the subsequent sentence, we give it up.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Headley is only committing a very common error, we
               think, in saying: “We get a definite idea of very few things in
               the world we have never seen, by mere naked details”—etc., etc.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here we are forced to say, imprimis, that Mr. H. has really no
               reference to things in the world we have never seen—but to
               things in the world we have seen. It is not the grammatical construction of the sentence, however, but its philosophy to which
               we allude. When details fail to convey distinct impressions, it
               is merely because the details themselves are indistinct. But all this
               is hypercriticism:—the book is an admirable book, and Mr.
               Headley is an admirable man.

            </p>
            
            <p>This is in all respects a valuable work—containing some of
               the most discriminative criticism we have ever read. We refer
               especially to a parallel between Shelley and Byron. The portraits are those of Shelley, Jeffrey, Godwin, Hazlitt, Bob. Hall,
               Chalmers, Carlyle, De Quincy, John Foster, Wilson, Edward
               Irving, Landor, Campbell, Brougham, Coleridge, Emerson,
               Worsdworth, Pollok, Lamb, Cunningham, Elliott, Keats, Macaulay, Aird, Southey, and Lockhart.
            </p>
            
            <p>Perhaps the most original and judicious of these sketches is
               that of Godwin—a very remarkable man, not even yet thoroughly understood.

            </p>
            
            <p>In private literary circles there has been much talk about this
               novel—the MS. of which, it appears, has either been seen or
               heard by a great number of individuals—some of whom abuse,
               while others highly commend it. We have not yet had time to
               read the volumes, but a glance assures us that (barring a little
               Maturinism or Bertramism) they are at least well-written, in the
               ordinary sense of the phrase.

            <p>Mr. Maturin, it is understood, is the son of the author of Mel-

               great deal of good, independently of their interest as fictions.
               “Chances and Changes” is, perhaps, the best of the six yet
               published. It is in the manner of “Chrysal or The Adventures
               of a Guinea,” and quite as good a book in every respect.

               engraved title-page, from a design by J. McPherson—tasteful at
               all points except the centre, which has too much the air of the
               label on Day &amp; Martin’s Blacking. The number opens with an
               admirable mezzotint by Sartain, and a good line engraving by
               Smillie,—subject Washington at Princeton. There is also a
               plate of Fashions—two figures—the whole well-drawn, well
               arranged and skilfully colored. In a Magazine designed in great

               Pot and Pearl Ashes—and The Progress of Population in Boston. Besides these papers we have Mercantile Law Cases—
               Commercial Chronicle—Commercial Regulations, etc. etc.—and
               several pages of judicious literary criticism. A very commendable point about this Magazine, is its strict nationality. No sectional bias, of any kind, is apparent. It is addressed emphatically

            <p>THE MOST noticeable event in prospectu is the bringing out of
               Richard the Third at the Park, by the Keans, immediately upon
               their return from Philadelphia. The tragedy, we learn, is to be
               produced in a style of splendor and perfection of detail altogether
               unexampled in this country. No pains or expense will be spared.
               Mr. Simpson will be at an outlay of three thousand dollars, and
               Mr. Kean will expend perhaps double that sum—equipping, for
               instance, a hundred supernumeraries. All the world will “be
               there to see.”

            <p>SOME OF the Charleston papers make allusion to the number
               of “communications” sent in to them in praise of “Mr. Crisp
               and Mrs. Mowatt”—very properly declining to insert them. We
               say “very properly,” for anonymous laudation of this kind, is always injurious in the end, if not immediately, to the interests of
               the party lauded. The public (or at least that portion of it whose
               opinion is of any value) have a sad habit of taking it for granted
               that the “communications” are the work directly, or indirectly, of
               the persons bepuffed. If they be, then, of course, their insertion
               is to be regretted on the ground that such attempts at self-praise
               are contemptible in the last degree; if they be not, their insertion
               is even still more to be regretted, on account of the unjust suspicions inevitably excited.

            <div class="biblPage">389</div>
            <p>WE PRESENT our readers, this week, passages from the
               Boston Press, on the Hamlet, Benedick, Claude Melnotte, and
               Othello of Mr. Murdoch. We are happy in this matter to
               agree with the Bostonians, and to find ourselves sustained so
               fully, in the judgment we had occasion to express, on Mr. M’s
               appearance before New York audiences.
            </p>
            
            <p>On Monday evening, we saw Mr. Murdoch’s impersonation of
               HAMLET; and we are surely not mistaken when we say it was Mr.
               Murdoch’s, for certainly he has drawn on no living actor for any
               peculiarity of style or manner in his acting of Hamlet. At the
               raising of the curtain he was received with the stormiest applause
               we ever saw or heard.
            </p>
            
            <p>It must have been a moment of intense anxiety, and almost of
               overwhelming feeling. Surrounded by warm friends and admirers,
               he must have been tried to his utmost “beat.” He was to cast a
               new die, and upon its issue depended his fate as an actor; appearing
               in a new character, he must have been suspended between hope and
               fear to their maddest verge. Through the first and second acts, we
               thought he faltered, and seemed oppressed by personal feeling; but
               often in the second act he broke through its fetters, and threw his
               whole soul into the character. The closing words of this act were
               delivered with more triumphant power than we ever had heard
               them before. When he exclaimed
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>The play’s the thing
               
               <br></br>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king,
            </div>
            
            <p>we were then fully satisfied that Murdoch was equal to the task he
               had undertaken; he had fallen upon a stratagem that would foil the
               subtil king, and enmesh him in his own conscience, and it gleamed
               from every nerve in the actor. The soliloquy commencing with
               "To be, or not to be,” was read with as fine an appreciation of all
               the great and pregnant questions therein as we ever heard it, not
               excepting even by the elder Kean.
            </p>
            
            <p>His conception of that part of this drama, we mean his treatment
               of Ophelia, was more in accordance with our own views than has
               been portrayed by any recent actor, unless Macready. Through his
               rigor towards her there seemed to beam a gentleness and affection
               truly admirable.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the dialogue between himself and mother, when he shows the
               picture of his father, he was too wild and declamatory. The passion should be strong, yet subdued. Will he try the value of this
               hint?—Boston Post

            <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr. Murdoch appeared in the character
               of BENEDICK in that delightful comedy of Shakspeare’s, “Much
               Ado About Nothing.” We never saw him in a fitter mood. He
               threw an irresistible charm and fascination over the part, which
               would have satisfied even the fancy of Shakspeare, had he been
               present. All the grace, sprightliness and elegance of a high order
               of acting were here exhibited, and we do not believe there is a
               better Benedick on the stage. We feel highly gratified to see his
               exquisite taste in a wardrobe, and its richness and brilliancy are
               unsurpassed.—Daily Times.

            <p>Mr. Murdoch was truly successful in the character of CLAUDE.
               By nature he is eminently qualified to perform this part. He has
               all that exuberance of spirits, that overflowing warmth of heart,
               which so well become this humble but aspiring young man, as depicted by the pen of Bulwer. In voice and action we readily and
               spontaneously exclaim, how “express and admirable.” There is
               one charm in the acting of Mr. Murdoch which we could not overlook; it is the manner in which he constantly wins upon his auditors. He never abates or falls off in fascination, but spell after
               spell comes upon them, produced by the witchery of his genius.
            </p>
            
            <p>We say “genius,” and that after full reflection. An actor who
               could thrill the house as he did, near the close of the fourth act,
               must be possessed of powers of the first order. It was no idle
               declamation, but the outpouring of a heart, strung to the highest
               pitch of human passion. He went through the last act with power
               and effect. Some passages of the reading were jewels in themselves; his picture of his palace was described in the finest oratorical voice we ever heard.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Murdoch's Claude Melnotte is emphatically a fine specimen
               of acting; and we are confident that hereafter, before a Boston
               audience, he will stand unsurpassed as the representative of that
               character.—Evening Transcript.

            <div class="biblPage">389</div>
            <p>MR. MURDOCH'S OTHELLO.—The announcement of Mr. Murdoch
               in the difficult character of Othello, on Thursday evening, drew
               together a very large and fashionable audience to the Athenaeum.
            </p>
            
            <p>Taken as a whole, Mr. M’s delineation of the character was fine
               and impressive, and drew down frequent and enthusiastic applause.
               In the earlier parts of the play the tragedian was somewhat reserved; and his address to the senate lacked dignity and force.
               But with this scene closed our dissent from his conception and
               delineation. The midnight brawl, rousing the soldier like a trumpet
               from his sleep, seemed to awaken all the fire and fervor of the actor.
               From that moment he gave himself up to the tide of stormy passion—of alternate tenderness and hate—doubt and doting—suspicion, revenge and despair, that make up one of the most terribly
               truthful characters drawn by the pen of the great dramatist. The
               rapid darkling of the noble nature of the Moor—the swift circulation of the poison instilled by the serpent—the fearful menaces—
               the wavering purposes—the gathered gloom—the fell revenge, and
               the despair more fell yet, of the ruined and betrayed lover and husband, flashed from the eyes, gestures, attitudes and tears of the actor
               to the hearts and minds of the entire audience. The furious charge
               to Iago—

            <p>the heart-broken farewell to all the “pomp, pride and circumstance
               of glorious war,” the mingled tenderness, sternness and ruthlessness of the murder scene, and the terrible expiation of the crime,
               were all the most critical could demand. We know not what future
               triumphs Mr. Murdoch has in store, but if he surpasses his
               “Othello,” he will indeed enact wonders.—Times.

         <p>ITALIAN OPERA IN HAVANA.—Muti had not opened his Opera
            House on the 6th instant. He has published his advertisement
            concerning the Italian Opera Company. The names of the persons engaged are as follows: Sra. RosinaPicco, Sra. Concepcion
            Cirartegui, Sra. Amalia Majocchi, Prima Donnas; Sra. Carolina
            Lazzarini, second do.; Sig. Cirilo Antognini, Sig. Luigi Perozzi,
            fieri tenor; Sig. Federico Badialli, second do.; Sig. Pietro Tomassi,
            first baritone; Sig. Attilio Valtelina, first basso; Sig. Antonino
            Sanquirico, first buffo cariato; Sig. Pietro Candi, second basso;
            and six ladies and twelve gentlemen for the choruses. The
            Diario says that Sanquirico was daily expected from Europe, and
            Perozzi, Tomassi and Candi from Mexico. Borghese alone is
            wanted to make it a capital company. When the season terminates in Havana, the whole troupe design coming here, and may
            open at Palmo’s in April next.

         <p>BALFE’S Opera, "The Bohemian Girl,” has been revived at the
            Park. A Mr. Delavanti is an addition to the troupe, and by no
            means an objectionable one.

         <p>WALLACE, the pianist, has composed an Opera, which is nightly
            drawing crowded houses in-London. We hope the enterprising
            Mr. Seguin will find means to bring it out in this city.

         <p>THE GERMAN OPERA, after performing “The Swiss Family”
            for one week to empty benches, has bidden us farewell, to rest on
            its laurels. The failure of this enterprise is so extraordinary,
            that it keeps the brains of many an editor at work to find out
            the cause of it. A committee of some of our most respectable
            German citizens have taken the matter in hand, and propose to
            give us a cycle of the best German Operas. The subscription
            lists which are going round, to cover the first expenses, are
            rapidly filling up.

         <p>MR. BURKE’S CONCERT, on Tuesday evening last, was attended
            by a most fashionable audience. We have heard the gentleman
            before, but under such disadvantages that we declined giving an
            opinion. We can now safely pronounce him one of the best
            violinists that we have ever heard in this country. His tone is
            solid and marrowy, his bowing is perfect from the mere saltando
            to the staccato, in every manner and shape. He was encored
            after every piece, but declined repeating the Capriccio by Vieux
            Temps, on account of too great previous exertion.
         </p>                      
         
         <p>We cannot say that we are so exceedingly delighted with the
            singing of either Mrs. Andrews or Mr. Zander. Mrs. A. has a
            quite peculiar voice, or rather half-a-dozen of them combined in
            one. Such variety is at times pleasing, but we did not find it so
            in either of the pieces which the lady selected. A peculiar turn
            was introduced by her at every single cadence, and we regret
            exceedingly not having any music type at our command, that we
            might have given it (the turn) to our readers. “Mr. L. T. Zander, Vocalist from Boston,” announces on the bill his first appearance in this city. We hope it may be his last.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Burke introduced in his Melange Brillante all the popular
            airs of the day, such as Yankee Doodle, Dandy Jim, Lucy Long,
            etc. During the performance of the last, which, by the bye,
            had a great deal of bowing, the wire on the G string got loose,
            and a passage in Harmonics was spoiled. Many of the audience
            expressed their regret at this accident, at the end of the performance. “There is one consolation,” he observed, “it is not the
            only break down in the piece.” Mr. Burke seems to possess a
            good-humor, which, combined with his extraordinary talent,
            cannot fail to win him hosts of friends and admirers. He goes
            to Boston to-morrow, and will return to this city by the 19th of
            January, when he will play at the Philharmonic Concert.

            <p>DR. COLLIER, the eminent Mesmerist, has written to us in reference to the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar. We quote a
               portion of his letter:
            </p>
            
            <div class="ab">Boston, December 16,1845.</div>
            
            <p>DEAR SIR—Your account of M. Valdemar’s Case has been universally copied in this city, and has created a very great sensation.
               It requires from me no apology, in stating, that I have not the least
               doubt of the possibility of such-a phenomenon; for, I did actually
               restore to active animation a person who died from excessive drinking of ardent spirits. He was placed in his coffin ready for interment.
            </p>
            
            <p>You are aware that death very often follows excessive excitement of the nervous system; this arising from the extreme prostration which follows; so that the vital powers have not sufficient
               energy to react.
            </p>
            
            <p>I will give you the detailed account on your reply to this, which
               I require for publication, in order to put at rest the growing impression that your account is merely a splendid creation of your own
               brain, not having any truth in fact. My dear sir, I have battled the
               storm of public derision too long on the subject of Mesmerism, to
               be now found in the rear ranks—though I have not publicly lectured
               for more than two years, I have steadily made it a subject of deep
               investigation.
            </p>
            
            <p>I sent the account to my friend Dr. Elliotson of London; also to
               the “Zoist,”—to which journal I have regularly contributed.
            </p>
            
            <p>Your early reply will oblige, which I will publish, with your
               consent, in connection with the case I have referred to. Believe
               me yours, most respectfully,
            </p>
            
            <div class="ab">ROBERT H. COLLVER.</div>
            
            <div class="ab">Edgar A. Poe, Esq., New York.</div>                   
            
            
            <p>We have no doubt that Mr. Collyer is perfectly correct in all
               that he says—and all that he desires us to say—but the truth is,
               there was a very small modicum of truth in the case of
               M. Valdemar—which, in consequence, may be called a hard
               case—very hard for M. Valdemar, for Mr. Collyer, and ourselves.
               If the story was not true, however, it should have been—and
               perhaps “The Zoist” may discover that it is true, after all.

            <div class="biblPage">391</div>
            
            <p>THE TRULY beautiful poem entitled “The Mountains,” and
               published in our last Journal, will put every reader in mind of the
               terseness and severe beauty of Macaulay’s best ballads—while it
               surpasses any of them in grace and imagination. Not for years
               has so fine a poem been given to the American public. It is the
               composition of Mr. P. P. Cooke of Virginia, author of “Florence
               Vane,” “Young Rosalie Lee,” and other exquisitely graceful and
               delicate things. Mr. Cooke’s prose, too, is nearly as meritorious
               as his poetry.
            </p>
            
            <p>For the deeply interesting paper “On the Poetical Literature
               of Germany,” (also published in our last number,) we are indebted to Professor T. L. Tellkampf, of Columbia College, in this
               city—brother of the celebrated German poet Adolphus Tellkampf.

            <p>THE DAILY NEWS—Speaking of Dickens’ projected paper, thus
               entitled, the correspondent of the Liverpool Chronicle says:
            </p>
            
            <p>I told you some time ago, if I recollect aright, that a new daily
               paper of ultra liberal politics was to be started, with Charles
               Dickens as the editor, and his father as field marshal or conductor.
               Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, the proprietors of Punch, are the
               spirited men ostensibly known in the new paper—that is to be.
               A number of “crack” reporters, all short-hand men, of the metropolitan journals, have been engaged, at salaries of seven, eight
               and ten guineas a-week, for three years certain. Dickens is to have
               two thousand a year! Jerrold, Mark Lemon, and others of “mark”
               and “likelihood,” are to be among the chief writers. There is
               plenty of cash in bank, and the parties are all men of undoubted
               honor. After a little “hitch,” the effects of which lasted only
               twenty-four hours, everything has gone on cheeringly. Charles
               Dickens had a dinner party the other day, composed of the principal
               lads engaged; each gentleman invited had come with six names for
               the future journal: after dinner these were discussed with the
               champagne and claret; some of the titles were funny enough, and
               your readers must lose a good laugh by my withholding them. Bygeneral consent, “The Daily News” was adopted. The paper is
               to be a rival of the old Whig Morning Chronicle.
            </p>
            
            <p>A capital of £100,000 was required to commence operations—
               so great, in England, is the risk and difficulty of establishing a
               daily paper. The first number will be issued on the first day of
               the new year. Among the collaborators is “an American gentleman who has acquired much note as a Magazinist,”—possibly
               John Neal.

            <p>THE BOSTON POST says:</p>
            
            <p>We have just learned of a most flattering compliment that has
               been recently paid by a crowned head of Europe to an American
               writer, Mr. A. J. Downing, of Highland Gardens, New York, who
               published, not long since, a most charming book on landscape
               gardening. Mr. Henry Wikoff, who arrived yesterday in the
               Acadia, from Liverpool, has brought over with him an autograph
               letter from the Queen of Holland, together with a magnificent ruby
               ring encircled by three rows of fine diamonds, in acknowledgment
               of the pleasure she had derived from the late perusal of Mr. Downing’s book. A compliment like this from a royal personage to an
               American author is certainly quite novel, and what enhances its
               value is the new mode made choice of. The gift of a jewel is the
               familiar form that a crowned head usually selects to express royal
               approbation, but it is the first instance of the kind we know of
               where an autograph letter was added to give a stronger emphasis to
               such a testimonial. We record with great pleasure this marked
               compliment to the talents of a fellow countryman, and congratulate
               Mr. Wikoff upon his honorable commission.
            </p>
            
            <p>For our own parts we are glad that Mr. Downing has received
               the ring—especially as it consists of diamonds and rubies and
               has, therefore, much intrinsic value. We use the words “intrinsic value” not rigorously, but in distinction from the factitious value which, in the public eye, appertains to the present as
               that of a monarch—and which in our own sincere opinion is precisely nothing at all—unless, indeed, we are to understand that
               the individual monarch, in this case, is a very especial judge of
               the merits of a work on “Landscape Gardening.” What we
               mean to say, is simply this:—that the value of any approbation,
               or any testimony of approbation, for a book, is in the ratio not
               of the worldly eminence, but in that of the judgment and good
               faith of the person who commends.

            <div class="biblPage">391</div>
            
            <p>THE BOSTON COURIER says:</p>
            
            <p>It is with deepest regret that we learn the death of Mrs. Maria
               Brooks, the authoress of “Zophiel.” She died on the 11th of Nov.
               last, at Matanzas, in the island of Cuba, from the debility consequent upon a severe fit of sickness. Mrs. Brooks was, at the time
               of her decease, about fifty years old. She was born at Medford, in
               this state, and for a considerable period resided in this city. About
               fifteen years ago she visited France and England, and while there
               formed many friendships with distinguished persons in both
               countries, among others with Lafayette, Wordsworth, and Southey.
               Of late years she has resided principally in Matanzas.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Brooks was one of the most remarkable women that ever
               lived. To great attainments in literature, she joined a powerful and
               original genius, and a character of singular energy and individuality.
               Both in England and the United States, she has been considered by
               all who have read her writings thoughtfully, as unmatched among
               poets of her sex. Southey, who superintended the publication of
               her “Zophiel,” had the most exalted opinion of her powers, and
               pronounced her “the most impassioned and imaginative of all
               poetesses.” When “Zophiel” was published, Charles Lamb wrote
               to a friend, that Southey was trying to pass off the poem as the production of an American woman, as if, he said, “there ever was a
               woman capable of writing such a poem.” This is high praise, but
               it is borne out by the poem itself. It is one of the few compositions
               written during the present century, destined for durable fame. It
               is one of the most original, passionate and harmonious works of imagination ever conceived—and there breathes through the whole the
               vital life of genius. Though it has not been extensively circulated
               in the United States, there are very few American productions
               which shed so much glory on our literature, or which are so often
               quoted abroad as evidences of American genius.
            </p>
            
            <p>That a mind of so much power and brilliancy should have departed—that one of the lights of our literature should have been
               quenched, we consider an occasion for the most sincere regret. But
               the image of that mind, stamped on her productions, will not depart. The light that illumines the records of her genius will not
               be quenched. Her memory will never return to the dust; her
               mind, even on earth, will have no grave and no tomb. Silently and
               surely her genius will work its way into the great public heart of
               the country, and her fame grow with time. And we cannot conceive of the period when an American, in reviewing the causes
               which have conducted to place his country in a proud intellectual
               position, and assisted in giving to it the immortality which springs
               from literature, shall cease to regard with peculiar gratitude and admiration the name of the authoress of “Zophiel.”
            </p>
            
            <p>The critic who writes this is somewhat given to excess of enthusiasm, and we certainly are very far from agreeing with him
               in his opinion that Mrs. Brooks was “considered by all who
               have read her writings thoughtfully as unmatched among poets
               of her sex.” The author of “Zophiel” was a truly imaginative
               poet, but no one, “who read her writings thoughtfully,” would
               think of comparing her with Miss Barrett—or even with Mrs.
               Norton. As for Lamb’s pert query—“was there ever a woman
               capable of writing such a poem?”—it merely proves that Lamb
               had little understanding of the true nature of Poetry—which, appealing especially to our sense of Beauty, is, in its very essence,
               feminine. If the greatest poems have not been written by women, it is because, as yet, the greatest poems have not been written at all.

            <br></br>Like silvery moonlit seas,
            
            <br></br>Or diamond’s glittering beam,
            
            <br></br>Their snow-hung branches round him shining seem.
            
            <br></br>Two starry tears in silence fall,
            
            <br></br>Congealed they fasten on the string
            
            <br></br>That woke so oft Love’s sweetest call—
            
            <br></br>No more for thee may lovers sing—
            
            <br></br>And dead the tones that told their suffering.

            <p>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office, 446
               Houston st., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’

            </p>
            
            <p>Doct. S.’s experience and skill in his profession give him confidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies
               in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in
               pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many difficult
               cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the same operation were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth
               is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth,
               both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appearance. In all these points, Dr. S.’s manner is pre-eminent. His
               mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to surmount many
               obstacles, which have long, with the profession generally, impeded
               the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the best
               materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has
               fallen away by absorption, (which is always the case, more or less,
               when teeth have been extracted,) which causes a contraction of the
               lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of which cannot be fully obviated
               without adopting the artificial gums, which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their
               beauty and natural appearance render detection impossible.
            </p>
            
            <p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
               the best families in this City, in which he has practised.

            <p>The aim of the editor has been to establish a Journal of Art and
               Letters, whose papers should be distinguished for force, vigor, sarcasm and pith, rather than an unutterable and bathetic profundity;
               one, which should not fear to expose literary quackery, and give to
               writers a proper precedence; one that had the moral courage to
               praise an enemy’s good works, and censure a friend’s bad ones; one
               that would maintain a rigorous independence on literary, political
               and religious matters; one that would attack all abuses without
               scruple; one that was insensible to fear, and deaf to favor; and one
               that depended for success on the merit of its papers, and not on the
               names announced as contributors. If the editor may judge from the
               high panegyric of the press, and the more substantial evidence of an
               increasing subscription list, he has succeeded in his intention.

            <p>*CAUTION.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
               market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
               the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
               that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so perceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.

            <p>MONSTROUS FRAUD.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
               retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
               because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
               in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less prica
               than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
               Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
               which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
               colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
               Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
               Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
               venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
               Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
               per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
               Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
               poison. The company have published a book, giving full details on
               this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
               free of charge.

            <p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
               dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
               now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
               pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
               and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
               Company, say we.—[Mirror.

            <p>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
               and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
               poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
               of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fragrant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
               Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea warehouse, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
               that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.

            <p>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
               teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
               greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
               the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
               to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.

            <p>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
               obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
               ware-rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as
               delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.

            <p>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of

            <p>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
               street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dollars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
               Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
               establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
               good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
               who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
               on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Pekin Tea Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
               of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
               great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
               proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
               public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
               is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
               effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
               the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
               an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
               The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice
               varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
               picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
               into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
               have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
               those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
               who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
               can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
               a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
               company's warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75Fulton street, unquestionably
               sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
               cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
               instances since they have opened their store.
            </p>
            
            <p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
               wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
               entitled “Hints to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
               information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[AngloAmerican.

            <p>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this
               country, are imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.
               Those who want good teas at reasonable prices, can always get them

            <p>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75

               the most delicious teas we ever drank, and retail them at wholesale
               prices.—[Evening Post.	oct. 8.
