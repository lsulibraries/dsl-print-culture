            <br/>I saw thee in thy tender, youthful bloom;
<br/>Ah! many then there were who loved thee well,
<br/>And in thy joy, and grace,
<br/>And loveliness rejoiced.
<br/>Years since have passed, charged with what freight of gloom!
<br/>How art thou changed! pale, woe-worn, hopeless, sad—
<br/>Amid the dismal wreck
<br/>Lives nought but cold Despair!
<br/>And thou repinest that thou stand’st apart,
<br/>Like the tree lightning-blasted; wrung with pain
<br/>No sympathy can heal,
<br/>No time can e’er assuage.
<br/>That life to thee is but a sea of woe,
<br/>Where deep unto its deep of sorrow calls,
<br/>While others walk a maze
<br/>Of flowers, and smiles, and joys!
<br/>Look up, thou lone and sorely stricken one!
<br/>Look up, thou darling of the Eternal Sire!
<br/>More blest a thousand fold
<br/>Than they, the idly gay!
<br/>For them earth yields her all of bliss; for thee
<br/>Kind heaven doth violence to its heart of love;
<br/>And Mercy holds thee fast,
<br/>Even in her iron bonds;
<br/>And wounds thee, lest thou ’scape her jealous care;
<br/>And her best gifts—the cross and thorn—bestows.
<br/>They dwell within the vale
<br/>Where fruits and flowers abound;
<br/>Those on Affliction’s high and barren place;
<br/>But round about the mount chariots of fire—
<br/>Horses of fire—encamp,
<br/>To keep thee safe for heaven!</div>

           <div class="head">A Walk to Flatbush.</div>
             <p>The earth seems quiet like some docile thing
<br/>Obeying the blue beauty of the skies.	Proctor.</p>
             <p>On Saturday last, a couple of friends and myself determined to
<br/>leave the City with its noise and distraction for a quiet walk
<br/>through some of Nature’s gentle scenes. Sincerity, a love for the
<br/>country, and a spirit of enjoyment, the power of extracting good
<br/>and beauty from the simplest objects, are all that are required in
<br/>a companion for a rural walk. I was doubly rich in my two
<br/>friends. The one, a young lawyer, was glad enough to escape
<br/>from the drudgery of a toilsome profession. His looks brightened
<br/>up, good talk flowed freely from his lips, his step was buoyant 
<br/>and triumphant, and his cane came down with a ringing sound,<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>as we walked through the lovely City of Brooklyn. He was
<br/> humming “Begone dull care.” He is one of those, whose qual-
<br/>ities of head and heart but few of his acquaintance appreciate,
<br/>for they sink into an absorbent ground of modesty and quiet
<br/>manners. He is truthful, has a well regulated mind, he loves a
<br/>beautiful landscape and house and grounds, has good taste, is
<br/>gentlemanly, plays on several instruments skilfully, and sings
<br/>well—enjoys a good story, and will tell an effective one in re-
<br/>turn. He laments that the happy days of his boyhood have
<br/>passed away, and speaks with rapture of his Saturday holiday
<br/>enjoyments, when life’s mere and breathing charm, was sufficient
<br/>for his comfort. The other of my companions has written much,
<br/>clearly expressed, and with a large portion of bland, heart-easing
<br/>philosophy. He is very agreeable, notwithstanding he stutters
<br/>somewhat in his eagerness to be delivered of his good sayings.
<br/>He has a few choice books, with which he is thoroughly imbued.
<br/>There is nothing narrow in his taste. He relishes Hooker, and
<br/>is an admirer of John Buncle. He reads novels and sermons, and
<br/>finds both admirable. He goes to theatres, concerts, and churches,
<br/>and finds them all interesting and instructive. He sometimes in-
<br/>dulges himself in imitating Methodist preachers in a stentorian
<br/>voice and with uplifted eyes, in a capital style and with great
<br/>unction. A ranting actor he does to the life. He loves and is
<br/>beloved by children; a sure test of his amiability. He is a great
<br/>admirer of Hazlitt, and is alive to the merits of Steele and Addi-
<br/>son. He has an old beautiful copy of Walton’s Angler which
<br/>he cherishes lovingly. The names of Rubens and Vandyke
<br/>sound pleasantly in his ear. He shakes hands heartily in a man-
<br/>ner which plainly says, “My dear boy, I am heartily glad to see
<br/>you.” Then comes sincere talk, and you hear spoons tinkling in
<br/>tumblers, and some old Brandy or Jamaica appears blushingly on
<br/>the scene, and then for a walk. He has good sense, a correct
<br/>taste, and a straight-forwardness of head and heart which are as
<br/>rare as they are delightful. He ought to have a fortune aad
<br/>keep open house all the year; it would snow meat and drink.
<br/>He sees God’s goodness in the tiny flower and in the giant oak.
<br/>He conceives life to be a blessing, and talks not of the sinful
<br/>flesh. If there were more of his nature in the world, society
<br/>would improve faster than it does.</p>
            <p>The morning was clear, the air pure and bracing, and we
<br/>went briskly on our winding way. The sun shone brightly
<br/>through the few remaining leaves that still clung to the gray
<br/>branches; their brethren that had once sparkled with them in
<br/>green beauty, when they were refreshed by summer showers,
<br/>now lay piled in heaps by the road side, and rustled to our tread.
<br/>On the top of one of the hills we had an extensive view of Brook-
<br/>lyn, the Narrows, Staten Island, the Jersey shore, and New York;
<br/>and in the opposite direction the ocean with its melancholy waste
<br/>melted into the sky. Some sheltered fields were still covered
<br/>with a tender green. At length, when we reached Flatbush, there
<br/>was an exclamation of delight from us all. The houses look
<br/>like homes, the abodes of quiet and contentment. They give
<br/>one a perfect idea of cleanliness and comfort. A Sabbath silence
<br/>brooded over the whole scene. The city, with its cares, and crimes
<br/>and pains, was forgotten. We were boys again. A walk through<div class="pagebreak" id="#page382"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Flatbush is delightful, for each side of the path is lined with
<br/>trees, and it is serpentine. If it looks like fairy land in Novem-
<br/>ber, it must be a bower of bliss in “the leafy month of June.”
<br/>In front of one of the inns, we saw an old weather-beaten sign,
<br/>a lion rampant: we liked the looks of it better than we did those
<br/>of its newer and glossier neighbors. We went in, and there</p>
              <p>Arrangement neat, and chastest order reign.—Young.</p>
              <p>Not a speck of dust was to be seen. Woman’s care, and taste,
<br/>were everywhere visible. We were waited upon by a young
<br/>woman, neatly attired, and well bred. We determined to dine
<br/>there, and when the dinner was prepared we were shown through
<br/>rambling rooms to an apartment that we judged to be the sitting-
<br/>room of the females of the family. It was well warmed, a cana-
<br/>ry bird was bathing himself in the warm sunshine—there was a
<br/>piano in the room, and a painting, most likely of sisters, with
<br/>sweet eyes and rosy lips was hung over it; there was also an
<br/>old-fashioned side-board, and the same scrupulous neatness. The
<br/>dinner was excellent and would have sharpened the most fastidi-
<br/>ous appetite. After the meal was dispatched, a polite, good-
<br/>looking girl procured the key of the piano, and the young lawyer
<br/>made it discourse most eloquent music—the tones sank into the
<br/>heart, and harmonized with file quiet and orderly spot in which
<br/>we were; the sun shed a golden tinge on some vine-leaves by
<br/>the window, and the garden paths looked as if the broom had
<br/>just passed over them. We felt a delicious repose</p>
                  <div class="lg">
            <br/>A wise man never will be sad;
                  <br/>But neither will sonorous bubbling mirth,
                  <br/>A shallow stream of happiness betray—
                  <br/>Too happy to be sportive, he’s serene.</div>
               <p>After luxuriating till warned by the gloaming to depart, we bid
<br/>a kind adieu to our fair entertainers and set our faces towards
<br/>home. Our way was cheered with conversation about our pleas-
<br/>ant ramble, our delicious fare, and the inn, that we all insisted
<br/>on never was, and never could be surpassed. The shades of
<br/>evening surrounded us before we reached Brooklyn; the air was
<br/>still; not a sound was heard, save</p>
            <p>The watch-dog’s voice that bay’d the whispering wind.</p>
            <p>Arrived home, we rejoiced that the day had passed so happily.</p>
            <p>Prosperity to Flatbush, and the inn with the sign of the lion-
<br/>rampant.</p>

<br/>Man’s heart may change, but Nature’s glory never:
<br/>And while the soul’s internal cell is bright,
<br/>The cloudless eye lets in the bloom and light
<br/>Of earth and heaven, to charm and cheer us ever.
<br/>Though youth has vanished like a winding river
<br/>Lost in the shadowy woods; and the dear sight
<br/>Of native hill and nest-like cottage white,
<br/>'Mid breeze-stirred boughs, whose crisp leaves gleam and quiver,
<br/>And murmur sea-like sounds, perchance no more
<br/>My homeward step shall hasten cheerily.
<br/>Yet still I feel as I have felt of yore,
<br/>And love this radiant world. Yon clear blue sky—
<br/>These gorgeous groves—this flower-enameled floor—
<br/>Have deep enchantments for my heart and eye.
II.
<br/>Man’s heart may change, but Nature’s glory never;
<br/>Though to the sullen gaze of grief the sight
<br/>Of sun-illumined skies may seem less bright,
<br/>Or gathering clouds less grand, yet she, as ever,
<br/>Is lovely or majestic. Though fate sever
<br/>The long-linked bonds of love, and all delight
<br/>Be lost, as in a sudden starless night,
<br/>The radiance may return, if He, the giver
<br/>Of peace on earth, vouchsafe the storm to still.
<br/>This breast, once shaken with the strife of care,
<br/>Is touched with silent joy. The cot—the hill
<br/>Beyond the broad blue wave—and faces fair
<br/>Are pictured in my dreams; yet scenes that fill
<br/>My waking eye can save me from despair.
III.
<br/>Man's heart may change, but Nature’s glory never:
<br/>Strange features throng around me, and the shore
<br/>Is not my fatherland. Yet why deplore
<br/>This varied doom? All mortal ties must sever—
<br/>The pang is past—and now, with blest endeavor,
<br/>I check the rising sigh, and weep no more.
<br/>The common earth is here—these crowds adore
<br/>That earth’s Creator; and how high soever
<br/>O’er other tribes proud England’s hosts may seem,
<br/>God’s children, fair or sable, equal find
<br/>A father’s love. Then learn, O man, to deem
<br/>All difference idle, save of heart or mind—
<br/>Thy duty, love—each cause of strife, a dream—
<br/>Thy home, the world—thy family, mankind.</div>

               <p>The Baron Ritzner Von Jung was of a noble Hungarian family,
<br/>every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any
<br/>certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent
<br/>of some description,—the majority for that species of grotesquerie
<br/>in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given
<br/>some vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications.
<br/>My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent
<br/>Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be
<br/>made public, threw me during the summer months of the year
<br/>18—. Here it was I obtained a place in his regard, and
<br/>here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his
<br/>mental conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear,
<br/>as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close;
<br/>and when, after three years separation, we met at G—————n, I
<br/>knew all that it was necessary to know of the character of the
<br/>Baron Ritzner Von Jung</p>
                <p>I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited with-
<br/>in the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I
<br/>remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by
<br/>all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the world,”
<br/>no person made any attempt at accounting for this opinion. That
<br/>he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed imper-
<br/>tinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But, letting
<br/>this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe that, from
<br/>the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the uni-
<br/>versity, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons
<br/>purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded
<br/>him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the
<br/>same time the most indefinitive and altogether unaccountable.
<br/>Thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an
<br/>era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people
<br/>appertaining to it or its dependencies as “that very extraordinary
<br/>epoch forming the domination of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.”</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page383"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
                <p>Upon his advent to G——————n, he sought me out in my apart-
<br/>ments. He was then of no particular age;—by which I mean
<br/>that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any
<br/>data personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty,
<br/>and was twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no
<br/>means a handsome man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of
<br/>his face was somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was
<br/>lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy,
<br/>glassy and meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be
<br/>observed. The lips were gently protruded, and rested the one
<br/>upon the other after such fashion that it is impossible to conceive
<br/>any, even the most complex, combination of human features, con-
<br/>veying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity-
<br/>solemnity and repose.</p>
                <p>It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,
<br/>that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then
<br/>to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and
<br/>the business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of
<br/>mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appear-
<br/>ance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his projects into
<br/>effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——————n, during that
<br/>renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the
<br/>Baron Ritzner Von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery
<br/>which overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person
<br/>at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected
<br/>him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog
<br/>at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of
<br/>Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.
<br/>This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and un-
<br/>pardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities, and buffoon-
<br/>eries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly
<br/>through his intermediate agency or connivance. The beauty, if
<br/>I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate
<br/>ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human
<br/>nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of
<br/>which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries
<br/>he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite,
<br/>and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was mak-
<br/>ing for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good
<br/>order and dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the
<br/>overwhelming mortification which, upon each such failure of his
<br/>praiseworthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his
<br/>countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity
<br/>in the bosoms of even his most sceptical companions. The adroit-
<br/>ness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he con-
<br/>trived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the
<br/>created—from his own person to the absurdities to which he had
<br/>given rise. In no instance before that of which I speak, have I
<br/>known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of
<br/>his manoeuvres—an attachment of the ludicrous to his own char-
<br/>acter and person. Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of
<br/>whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society;
<br/>and not even his own household have for a moment associated
<br/>other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory
<br/>of the Baron Ritzner Von Jung.</p>
               <p>During the epoch of his residence at G—————n it really appeared
<br/>that the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon
<br/>the university. Nothing at least, was done, beyond eating and
<br/>drinking, and making merry. The apartments of the students
<br/>were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-
<br/>house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of
<br/>the Baron. Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and
<br/>long, and never unfruitful of events.</p>
            <p>Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk.
<br/>The company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the
<br/>Baron and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of
<br/>high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an ex-
<br/>aggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra
<br/>German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions
<br/>some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four despe-
<br/>rate and fatal recontres at G——————n, had given new vigor and
<br/>impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of
<br/>the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the times.
<br/>The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the
<br/>earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused
<br/>from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt
<br/>upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the
<br/>received code of etiquette in passages of arms, with an ardor, an
<br/>eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner,
<br/>which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general,
<br/>and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be
<br/>at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended,
<br/>and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette
<br/>in the sovereign contempt which it deserves.</p>
             <p>Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse,
<br/>(of which, my readers may gather some faint idea when I say
<br/>that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monoto-
<br/>nous, yet musical, sermonic manner of Coleridge,) I perceived
<br/>symptoms of even more than the general interest in the counte-
<br/>nance of one of the party. This gentleman, whom I shall call
<br/>Hermann, was an original in every respect—except, perhaps, in
<br/>the single particular that he was a very great fool. He contrived
<br/>to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a rep-
<br/>utation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some
<br/>logical talent. As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even
<br/>at G———n. I forget the precise number of victims who had fal-
<br/>len at his hands; but they were many. He was a man of cour-
<br/>age undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute acquaintance with
<br/>the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor,
<br/>that he most especially prided himself. These things were a hob-
<br/>by which he rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the look-
<br/>out for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past
<br/>afforded food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not
<br/>aware; although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that some-
<br/>thing of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend,
<br/>and that Hermann was its especial object.</p>
             <p>As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue,
<br/>I perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At
<br/>length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon
<br/>by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron re-
<br/>plied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment)
<br/>and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm
<br/>and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in his
<br/>teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago
<br/>of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember. “our
<br/>opinions, allow me to say, Baron Von Jung, although in the
<br/>main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself
<br/>and to the university of which you are a member. In a few re-
<br/>spects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would
<br/>say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you of-
<br/>fence (here the speaker smiled blandly,) I would say, sir, that
<br/>your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gen-
<br/>tleman.”</p>
            <p>As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were
<br/>turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red,
<br/>then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,
<br/>when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be<div class="pagebreak" id="#page384"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the quiz-
<br/>zical expression which was its natural character, but which I
<br/>had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, 
<br/>and when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he
<br/>stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of!
<br/>countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before,
<br/>For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and I
<br/>that he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with
<br/>passion, and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time
<br/>he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion.
<br/>Having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter
<br/>which stood near him, saying, as he held it firmly clenched—
<br/>“The language you have thought proper to employ, Mynheer
<br/>Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so
<br/>many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specifi-
<br/>cation. That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be
<br/>expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive
<br/>as to allow me but one line of conduct. Some courtesy, never-
<br/>theless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself,
<br/>at this moment, as my guest. You will pardon me, therefore, if,
<br/>upon this consideration, I deviate slightly from the general usage
<br/>among gentleman in similar cases of personal affront. You will
<br/>forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your imagina-
<br/>tion, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of
<br/>your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann him-
<br/>self. This being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. I
<br/>shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder
<br/>mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of re-
<br/>sentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence
<br/>to your real person will be obviated.”</p>
            <p>With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against
<br/>the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the
<br/>reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shat-
<br/>tering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once
<br/>started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and Ritzner,
<br/>took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron whis-
<br/>pered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my ser-
<br/>vices. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make
<br/>of so ridiculous a piece of business.</p>
            <p>The duellist accepted my aid with his usual stiff and ultra
<br/>recherché air, and taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could
<br/>hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to dicuss,
<br/>with the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly pe-
<br/>culiar character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome
<br/>harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book-
<br/>shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,
<br/>and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading
<br/>aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remem-
<br/>ber the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance
<br/>of Philip le Bel on Single Combat;” the “Theatre of Honor,',
<br/>by Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by An-
<br/>diguier. He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s
<br/>“Memoirs of Duels,” published at Cologne, in 1666, in the types
<br/>of Elzevir—a precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a
<br/>fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested my atten-
<br/>tion particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a
<br/>thick octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a French-
<br/>man, and having the quaint title, “Duelli Lex scripta, et non;
<br/>aliterque. From this he read me one of the drollest chapters in
<br/>the world concerning “Injuriæ per applicationem, per construe,
<br/>tionem, et per se,” about half of which, he averred, was strictly
<br/>applicable to his own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not
<br/>one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the life
<br/>of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and de-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>manded what I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I
<br/>had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and
<br/>would abide by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed
<br/>flattered, and sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:</p>
            <p>Sir,—My friend, M. P——, will hand you this note. I find
<br/>it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an
<br/>explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers, In
<br/>the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to
<br/>arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps pre-
<br/>liminary to a meeting.</p>
            <p>With sentiments of perfect respect,</p>
            <p>Your most humble servant,</p>
            <p>Johan Hermann.</p>
            <p>To the Baron Ritzner Von Jung,</p>
            <p>August 18th, 18—.</p>
            <p>Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with
<br/>this epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave coun-
<br/>tenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he
<br/>wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.</p>
            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your
<br/>note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the
<br/>propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted,
<br/>I still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature
<br/>of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my
<br/>part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology, as
<br/>to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows
<br/>of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that extreme
<br/>delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of
<br/>etiquette, for which you have been so long and so preeminently
<br/>distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being com-
<br/>prehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my
<br/>own, to refer you to the opinions of the Sieur Hedelin, as set
<br/>forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of “Injuriæ per ap-
<br/>plicationem, per constructionem, et per se,'' in his “Duelli Lex
<br/>scripta, et non; aliterque.’’ The nicety of your discernment in all
<br/>the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am assured, to con-
<br/>vince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this
<br/>admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of hon-
<br/>or, for explanation.</p>
            <p>With sentiments of profound respect,</p>
            <p>Your most obedient servant,</p>
            <p>Von Jung.</p>
            <p>The Herr Johan Hermann.</p>
            <p>August 18th, 18—.</p>
            <p>Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,
<br/>which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous
<br/>self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuria per
<br/>applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished read-
<br/>ing, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be
<br/>seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. Turn-
<br/>ing to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself,
<br/>then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confi-
<br/>dential acquaintance, to express to the Baron Von Jung his exalted
<br/>sense of his chivalrous behaviour, and, in that of second, to as-
<br/>sure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most
<br/>honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.</p>
            <p>Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron.
<br/>He seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of
<br/>course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to
<br/>an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “Duelli<div class="pagebreak" id="#page385"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” He handed me the volume and
<br/>asked me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little
<br/>purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.
<br/>He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud.
<br/>To my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly ab-
<br/>surd account of a duel between two baboons. He now explain-
<br/>ed the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima
<br/>facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du
<br/>Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so
<br/>as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility,
<br/>and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning
<br/>existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every
<br/>second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series
<br/>of ludicrous quizzes upon single combat as practised in modern
<br/>times.</p>
            <p>The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely
<br/>thrown the treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before
<br/>the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor
<br/>of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest at-
<br/>tention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.
<br/>Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have die! a thou-
<br/>sand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand
<br/>anything and everything in the universe that had ever been
<br/>written about the duello.</p>

<br/>In every motion, grace was hers;
<br/>On every feature, sweetness dwelt;

<br/>Affections soon before her knelt.
<br/>She bloom’d through all the summer days,

<br/>So calm the current of her life,
<br/>So lovely and serene its flow,

<br/>But Autumn winds grew wild and chill,
<br/>And pierced her with their icy breath;

<br/>Our memory of her voice can stir;
<br/>With things too beautiful for earth

                <p>The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. First American Edi-
<br/>tion (Complete); with some remarks on the Poetical Faculty, and
<br/>its influence on Human Destiny. Embracing a Biographical
<br/>and Critical Notice, by G. G. Foster, New York. J. S. Red-
<br/>field, Clinton Hall.</p>
                <p>This is a very beautiful edition of a poet whom all poets, and
<br/>whom poets only, appreciate. The volume is a pendant of the
<br/>Carey’s Dante lately issued by D. Appleton &amp; Co., and includes
<br/>750 pages duodecimo—fine type and exquisite paper. It is, as
<br/>asserted, a complete edition of the works of the author—rather too
<br/>complete, perhaps; for many of the Fragments are utterly desti-
<br/>tute of intrinsic value, and have no other interest than what ap-
<br/>pertains to them as relics of Shelley. The Biographical and Crit-
<br/>ical Notice by Mr. Foster, is well written, (barring a little justi-
<br/>fiable furore) and evinces a keen discrimination, and, very espe-
<br/>cially, a thorough appreciation of the excellences of the subject of
<br/>the memoir. We shall be pardoned for copying some passages
<br/>embodying Mr. Foster’s opinions on “The Revolt of Islam”
<br/>and affording, also, a fair specimen of his style:</p>
                <p>The “Revolt of Islam,” although not admitted by the critics to
<br/>be his grandest work, is, in the meaning I attach to poetry, alto-
<br/>gether the most important. It is, as it were, the consummation of
<br/>himself—the prophecy which he has uttered; and although it con-
<br/>tained still more literary errors than have been charged upon it, yet
<br/>in this view they would not detract from the importance of it. But
<br/>these errors are, for the most part, mere distortions of the critics’
<br/>brains, and do not deserve seriously to be alleged against a man who
<br/>has shown his right to disregard the apparent and mechanical laws
<br/>of poetry, by proving that he has held living communion with the
<br/>source whence those laws have been attempted to be drawn. Au-
<br/>tumn is a faulty colorist, by all the rules of Dilettantism—and yet
<br/>we do not criticise, but admire her pictures. Language is at best
<br/>but a dull instrument for Thought to work withal; and if Shelley
<br/>has succeeded in producing, as a whole, deeper effects and more
<br/>beautiful pictures than others, we will not quarrel with him because
<br/>his instinct has developed rules of composition of which our critical
<br/>scholarship happened to be ignorant: the great bard of Avon has
<br/>been quite annihilated by the critics several times; and yet we have
<br/>even forgotten their names, long ago, while we every day bring fresh
<br/>worship to his altar—which bears not even a mark of all the critics’
<br/>well-filed teeth that have ever nibbled at its base.</p>
                <p>The “Revolt of Islam” is written in twelve cantos of Spenserian
<br/>stanzas, and was at first to have been called “Laon and Cythna.”</p>
                <p>*******</p>
                <p>Bold as it is in many of the sentiments, it is a noble monument to
<br/>the loftiness of his aims, the brilliancy of his imagination, the
<br/>wealth of love in his heart, and the breadth and power of his intel-
<br/>lect It is an armory from which the young enthusiasts of many
<br/>generations to come may draw their weapons, in the assurance that
<br/>they are of tried temper and exquisite polish. We have never read
<br/>it without feeling our souls stirred within us as with the sound of a
<br/>trumpet—it has enlarged our thoughts, expanded and warmed our
<br/>affections, quickened our purposes of good, and filled us with an
<br/>unquenchable flame of philanthropy and love. It is almost the only
<br/>poem that we can read at all seasons. In those darker moments,
<br/>when the sense of misdirected efforts, or the exhaustion of disease,
<br/>or the dark and mysterious dread oi some future ill, weighs like an
<br/>incubus upon the soul, it is almost the only work, after the gospels,
<br/>that furnishes nutriment and solace to our mind. Then, it touches
<br/>us with a feeling of universal sympathy. It awakens us to the
<br/>broad, deep sorrows of the world, it quickens languid and lagging
<br/>resolutiens, it confirms our faith in good, and swells our hearts with
<br/>high and bursting hopes. Oh sweet, incomprehensibly sweet, are
<br/>the emotions of intense and burning enthusiosm that it kindles!</p>

               <br/>Where plgrims seek the Prophet’s tomb
<br/>Across the Arabian waste,
<br/>Upon the ever shifting sands,
<br/>A fearful path is traced.
<br/>Far up to the horizon’s verge,
<br/>The traveler sees it rise,
<br/>A line of ghastly bones that bleach
<br/>Beneath those burning skies.
<br/>Across it, tempest and simoom
<br/>The desert sands have strewed,
<br/>But still that line of spectral white
<br/>Forever is renewed.
<br/>For while along that burning track
<br/>The caravans move on,
<br/>Still do the way-worn pilgrims fall,
<br/>Ere yet the shrine be won.
<br/>There the tired camel lays him down
<br/>And shuts his gentle eyes,
<br/>And there the fiery rider droops,
<br/>Toward Mecca looks and dies.
<br/>They fall unheeded from the ranks:—
<br/>On sweeps the endless train,
<br/>But there to mark the desert path
<br/>Their whitening bones remain.
<br/>As thus I read the mournful tale
<br/>Upon the traveler’s page,
<br/>I thought how like the march of life
<br/>Is this sad pilgrimage.
<br/>For every heart hath some fair dream,
<br/>Some object unattained,
<br/>And far off in the distance lies
<br/>Some Mecca to be gained.
<br/>But beauty, manhood, love and power
<br/>Go in their morning down,
<br/>And longing eyes and outstretched arms
<br/>Tell of the goal unwon.
<br/>The mighty caravan of life
<br/>Above their dust may sweep,
<br/>Nor shout, nor trampling feet shall break
<br/>The rest of those who sleep.
<br/>Oh, fountains that I have not reached,
<br/>That gush far off e’en now,
<br/>When shall I quench my spirit’s thirst
<br/>Where your sweet waters flow?
<br/>Oh, Mecca of my life-long dreams,
<br/>Cloud-palaces that rise
<br/>In that far distance pierced by hope,
<br/>When will ye greet mine eyes?<br/>

<br/>Brothers.</p>
                <p>We said a few words, last week, of this admirable collection
<br/>of essays, and now take the liberty of extracting some portion of
<br/>the interesting paper on the genius of Brockden Brown:</p>
                <p>The explication of the mysteries of Wieland naturally suggests
<br/>the question how far an author is bound to explain the supernatu-
<br/>ralities, if we may so call them, of his fictions; and whether it is
<br/>not better, on the whole, to trust to the willing superstition
<br/>and credulity of the reader (of which there is perhaps store
<br/>enough in almost every bosom, at the present enlightened day
<br/>even, for poetical purposes) than to attempt a solution on purely
<br/>natural or mechanical principles. It was thought no harm for the
<br/>ancients to bring the use of machinery into their epics, and a simi-
<br/>lar freedom was conceded to the old English dramatists, whose
<br/>ghosts and witches were placed in the much more perilous predica-
<br/>ment of being subjected to the scrutiny of the spectator, whose
<br/>senses are not near so likely to be duped as the sensitive and excited
<br/>imagination of the reader in his solitary chamber. It must be ad-
<br/>mitted, however, that the public of those days, when the
                              <div class="lg">
                  <br/>Undoubting mind
           <br/>Believed the magic wonders that were sung,</div>
               <br/>were admirably seasoned for the action of superstition in all forms,
<br/>and furnished, therefore, a most enviable audience for the melo-
<br/>dramatic artist, whether dramatist or romance-writer. But all this
<br/>is changed. No witches ride the air now-a-days, and fairies no
<br/>longer “dance their rounds by the pale moonlight,” as the worthy
<br/>Bishop Corbet, indeed, lamented a century and a half ago.</p>
                <p>Still it may be allowed, perhaps, if the scene is laid in some re-
<br/>mote age or country, to borrow the ancient superstitions of the place
<br/>and incorporate them into, or, at least, color the story with them,
<br/>without shocking the well-bred prejudices of the modern reader.
<br/>Sir Walter Scott has done this with good effect in more than one of
<br/>his romances, as every one will readily call to mind. A fine exam-
<br/>ple occurs in the Boden Glas apparition in Waverley, which the
<br/>great novelist, far from attempting to explain on any philosophical
<br/>principles, or even by an intimation of its being the mere creation
<br/>of a feverish imagination, lias left as he found it, trusting that the
<br/>reader’s poetic feeling will readily accommodate itself to the popular
<br/>superstitions of the country he is depicting. This reserve on his
<br/>part, indeed, arising from a truly poetic view of the subject, and
<br/>an honest reliance on a similar spirit in his reader, has laid him
<br/>open, with some matter-of-fact people, to the imputation of not
<br/>being wholly untouched himself by the national superstitions. Yet
<br/>how much would the whole scene have lost in its permanent effect
<br/>if the author had attempted an explanation of the apparition on the
<br/>ground of an optical illusion not infrequent among the mountain
<br/>mists of the Highlands, or any other of the ingenious solutions so
<br/>readily at the command of the thorough-bred story-teller!</p>
                <p>It must be acknowledged, however, that this way of solving the
<br/>riddles of romance would hardly be admissible in a story drawn
<br/>from familiar scenes and situations in modern life, and especially in
<br/>our own country. The lights of education are flung too bright and
<br/>broad over the land to allow any lurking-hole for the shadows of a
<br/>twilight age. So much the worse for the poet and the novelist
<br/>Their province must now be confined to poor human nature, with-
<br/>out meddling with the “Gorgons and chimeras dire” which floated
<br/>through the bewildered brains of our forefathers, at least on the
<br/>other aide of the water. At any rate, if a writer, in this broad sun<div class="pagebreak" id="#page387"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>shine, ventures on any sort of diablerie he is forced to explain it by
<br/>all the thousand contrivances of trap-doors, secret passages, waxen
<br/>images, and other make-shifts from the property-room of Mrs. Rad-
<br/>cliffe and Company.</p>
                <p>Brown, indeed, has resorted to a somewhat higher mode of eluci-
<br/>dating his mysteries by a remarkable phenomenon of our nature.
<br/>But the misfortune of all these attempts to account for the marvels
<br/>of the story by natural or mechanical causes is, that they are very
<br/>seldom satisfactory, or competent to their object. This is emi-
<br/>nently the case with the ventriloquism in Wieland. Even where
<br/>they are competent, it may be doubted whether the reader, who has
<br/>suffered his credulous fancy to be entranced by the spell of the
<br/>magician, will be gratified to learn, at the end, by what cheap me-
<br/>chanical contrivance he has been duped. However this may be, it
<br/>is certain that a very unfavorable effect, in another respect, is pro-
<br/>duced on his mind, after he is made acquainted with the nature of
<br/>the secret spring by which the machinery is played, more especially
<br/>when one leading circumstance, like ventriloquism in Wieland, is
<br/>made the master-key, as it were, by which all the mysteries are to
<br/>be unlocked and opened at once. With this explanation at hand,
<br/>it is extremely difficult to rise to that sensation of mysterious awe
<br/>and apprehension on which so much of the sublimity and general
<br/>effect of the narrative necessarily depends. Instead of such feelings,
<br/>the only ones which can enable us to do full justice to the author’s
<br/>conceptions, we sometimes, on the contrary, may detect a smile
<br/>lurking in the corner of the mouth, as we peruse scenes of positive
<br/>power, from the contrast obviously suggested of the impotence of
<br/>the apparatus and the portentous character of the results. The
<br/>critic, therefore, possessed of the real key to the mysteries of the
<br/>story, if he would do justice to his author’s merits, must divest
<br/>himself, as it were, of his previous knowledge, by fastening his
<br/>attention on the results, to the exclusion of the insignificant means
<br/>by which they are achieved. He will not always find this an easy
<br/>matter.</p>

<br/>Clark &amp; Austin.</p>
                <p>Most of the poems here included, are familiar friends, and we
<br/>cordially welcome their re-appearance. A modest Preface says:</p>
                <p>The early life of the author was spent in a wild and picturesque re-
<br/>gion in the southwestern part of New York—his native state. Apart
<br/>from the busy haunts of mankind, his eye was caught by the strongly
<br/>marked and beautiful scenes by which he was surrounded: and to the
<br/>first impressions thus made may be attributed the fact that his subjects
<br/>relate so much to Nature and so little to Man. Instead, therefore, of
<br/>aiming to depict the human heart, he has endeavored to sketch (how-
<br/>ever rudely and imperfectly) the features of that with which he was
<br/>most familiar.</p>
                <p>These are the impulsive words of a true poet. Man is, in fact,
<br/>only incidentally a poetic theme:—we mean the heart and intel-
<br/>lect of Man—matters which the pseudo-transcendentalists of
<br/>Frogpondium are perpetually attempting to force into poetry—
<br/>with no other object than to impart to their doggrel an air of pro-
<br/>fundity.</p>
                <p>Mr. Street’s subjects are invariably poetical ones—but they
<br/>belong not to the loftiest order. They are descriptive altogether—
<br/>not sufficiently ideal. Mr. Bryant seems to have been the model
<br/>—although the Beauty of Nature may have been the inspiration.</p>
                <p>The volume is a very handsome octavo of 319 pages, and does
<br/>credit to the taste and liberality of the publishers.</p>

                <p>Hyperion, a Romance. By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
<br/>Second Edition, Cambridge: John Owen.</p>
                <p>This is one of the most tastefully printed books we have seen
<br/>for many a year:—a thick duodecimo of 370 pages—delightful
<br/>type, unusually good paper—well bound. The work itself is
<br/>sufficiently well known. It has all Mr. Longfellow’s distinctive-<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>ness of thought and manner—is graceful, scholar-like, at times
<br/>pointed, and always artistical, but neither original, nor very inter-
<br/>estiing. Its tone is a palpable imitation of the German spirit. One
<br/>of its marked peculiarities—and an idiosyncrasy, in fact, apper-
<br/>taining to all that the author does—is its entire want of suggest-
<br/>iveness. The book does not go beyond itself Mr. Longfellow’s
<br/>works seem to some minds greater than they are, on account of
<br/>their perfection of finish—on account of the thoroughness with
<br/>which their designs are carried out. They exhaust limited sub-
<br/>jects. His books are books and no more. Those of men of ge-
<br/>nius ate books and a dream to boot. These men do not exhaust
<br/>their subjects, because their subjects expand with every touch.

                <p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of American Books. No. 10. The
<br/>Alps and the Rhine. By J. T. Headley.</p>
                <p>This is one of the most entertaining books yet issued in the
<br/>American series. The vivacity and blilliant fancy of Headley
<br/>throw a charm over all his descriptions—a charm that has all the
<br/>effect of novelty—if indeed it is not.</p>
                <p>A marked peculiarity of the author is the Irishy abandon or
<br/>neck-or-nothingness of his manner. He writes as if he held it a
<br/>sin to keep us waiting a moment—either for grammar or any
<br/>thing else.</p>
                <p>“I have never felt” says his Preface “the need of stronger
<br/>Saxon more than when standing amid the chaos of an Alpine
<br/>abyss or looking off from the summit of an Alpine peak. Like
<br/>the attempt to utter a man’s deepest emotions, words for the time
<br/>shock him.”</p>
                <p>Why “off?”—is not “from” enough? The “summit of a
<br/>peak” is something, we presume, like the end of an extremity.
<br/>As for the subsequent sentence, we give it up.</p>
                <p>Mr. Headley is only committing a very common error, we
<br/>think, in saying: “We get a definite idea of very few things in
<br/>the world we have never seen, by mere naked details”—etc., etc.</p>
                <p>Here we are forced to say, imprimis, that Mr. H. has really no
<br/>reference to things in the world we have never seen—but to
<br/>things in the world we have seen. It is not the grammatical con-
<br/>struction of the sentence, however, but its philosophy to which
<br/>we allude. When details fail to convey distinct impressions, it
<br/>is merely because the details themselves are indistinct. But all this
<br/>is hypercriticism:—the book is an admirable book, and Mr.
<br/>Headley is an admirable man.</p>

               <p>This is in all respects a valuable work—containing some of
<br/>the most discriminative criticism we have ever read. We refer
<br/>especially to a parallel between Shelley and Byron. The por-

<br/>Chalmers, Carlyle, De Quincy, John Foster, Wilson, Edward
<br/>Irving, Landor, Campbell, Brougham, Coleridge, Emerson,
<br/>Worsdworth, Pollok, Lamb, Cunningham, Elliott, Keats, Mac-
<br/>aulay, Aird, Southey, and Lockhart.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most original and judicious of these sketches is
<br/>that of Godwin—a very remarkable man, not even yet thorough-
<br/>ly understood.</p>

                <p>In private literary circles there has been much talk about this

<br/>read the volumes, but a glance assures us that (barring a little
<br/>Maturinism or Bertramism) they are at least well-written, in the
<br/>ordinary sense of the phrase.</p>
                <p>Mr. Maturin, it is understood, is the son of the author of Mel-

<br/>engraved title-page, from a design by J. McPherson—tasteful at
<br/>all points except the centre, which has too much the air of the
<br/>label on Day &amp; Martin’s Blacking. The number opens with an
<br/>admirable mezzotint by Sartain, and a good line engraving by
<br/>Smillie,—subject Washington at Princeton. There is also a
<br/>plate of Fashions—two figures—the whole well-drawn, well
<br/>arranged and skilfully colored. In a Magazine designed in great
<br/>part for ladies, a fashion-plate, such as this, is not only not objec-

<br/>Fanny Forrester, Lowell, Eames, Street, Brooks, Chivers, and

<br/>magnificent stanza:</p>

            <div class="lg">
               <br/>Titanic shapes, with faces blank and dun,
<br/>Of their old Godhead born,
<br/>Gaze on the embers of the sunken sun,
<br/>Which they misdeem for morn;
<br/>And yet the eternal sorrow
<br/>In their unmonarched eyes says day is done,
<br/>Without the hope of morrow.<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>And here a melodious one :
<br/>Here, ’mid the bleak waves of our strife and care
<br/>Float the green Fortunate Isles,
<br/>Where all our hero spirits dwell, and share
<br/>Our martyrdoms and toils;
<br/>The present moves attended
<br/>With all of brave, and excellent, and fair
<br/>That made the old time splendid.</div>
                      
                      <p>The number contains, also, other excellent poetry. We mention,
<br/>in especial, the “Proem to the Froissart Ballads”—although this
<br/>is strongly tinctured with imitation. For example:</p>

<br/>best numbers yet issued of the most decidedly useful of American
<br/>Magazines. This issue completes the thirteenth volume. The
<br/>contents are—The Value and Prospects of Life in the United
<br/>States—The Cotton Trade—The System of Mutual Insurance
<br/>examined with Reference to the Question of Individual Liability—
<br/>Maritime Law, Piracy and Financiering—Electricity as the Cause
<br/>of Storms—The March of Our Republic—The Consular System—
<br/>Pot and Pearl Ashes—and The Progress of Population in Bos-
<br/>ton. Besides these papers we have Mercantile Law Cases—
<br/>Commercial Chronicle—Commercial Regulations, etc. etc.—and
<br/>several pages of judicious literary criticism. A very commenda-
<br/>ble point about this Magazine, is its strict nationality. No sec-
<br/>tional bias, of any kind, is apparent. It is addressed emphatically
<br/>to the people of the United States.</p>

                <p>The contributions are from many of the best of our litterateurs.

                  <p>The most noticeable event in prospectu is the bringing out of
<br/>Richard the Third at the Park, by the Keans, immediately upon
<br/>their return from Philadelphia. The tragedy, we learn, is to be
<br/>produced in a style of splendor and perfection of detail altogether
<br/>unexampled in this country. No pains or expense will be spared.
<br/>Mr. Simpson will be at an outlay of three thousand dollars, and
<br/>Mr. Kean will expend perhaps double that sum—equipping, for

<br/>the party lauded. The public (or at least that portion of it whose
<br/>opinion is of any value) have a sad habit of taking it for granted
<br/>that the “communications” are the work directly, or indirectly, of
<br/>the persons bepuffed. If they be, then, of course, their insertion
<br/>is to be regretted on the ground that such attempts at self-praise
<br/>are contemptible in the last degree; if they be not, their insertion

                    <p>On Monday evening, we saw Mr. Murdoch’s impersonation of
<br/>Hamlet; and we are surely not mistaken when we say it was Mr.
<br/>Murdoch’s, for certainly he has drawn on no living actor for any
<br/>peculiarity of style or manner in his acting of Hamlet. At the
<br/>raising of the curtain he was received with the stormiest applause
<br/>we ever saw or heard.</p>
                    <p>It must have been a moment of intense anxiety, and almost of
<br/>overwhelming feeling. Surrounded by warm friends and admirers,
<br/>he must have been tried to his utmost “beat.” He was to cast a
<br/>new die, and upon its issue depended his fate as an actor; appearing
<br/>in a new character, he must have been suspended between hope and
<br/>fear to their maddest verge. Through the first and second acts, we
<br/>thought he faltered, and seemed oppressed by personal feeling; but
<br/>often in the second act he broke through its fetters, and threw his
<br/>whole soul into the character. The closing words of this act were
<br/>delivered with more triumphant power than we ever had heard
<br/>them before. When he exclaimed
                    
                   <div class="lg">
                  <br/>The play’s the thing
<br/>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king,</div>

               <br/>we were then fully satisfied that Murdoch was equal to the task he
<br/>had undertaken; he had fallen upon a stratagem that would foil the
<br/>subtil king, and enmesh him in his own conscience, and it gleamed
<br/>from every nerve in the actor. The soliloquy commencing with
<br/>‘‘To be, or not to be,” was read with as fine an appreciation of all
<br/>the great and pregnant questions therein as we ever heard it, not
<br/>excepting even by the elder Kean.</p>
                    <p>His conception of that part of this drama, we mean his treatment
<br/>of Ophelia, was more in accordance with our own views than has
<br/>been portrayed by any recent actor, unless Macready. Through his
<br/>rigor towards her there seemed to beam a gentleness and affection
<br/>truly admirable.</p>
                    <p>In the dialogue between himself and mother, when he shows the
<br/>picture of his father, he was too wild and declamatory. The pas-
<br/>sion should be strong, yet subdued. Will he try the value of this
<br/>hint?—Boston Post</p>

                    <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr. Murdoch appeared in the character
<br/>of Benedick in that delightful comedy of Shakspeare’s, “Much
<br/>Ado About Nothing.” We never saw him in a fitter mood. He
<br/>threw an irresistible charm and fascination over the part, which
<br/>would have satisfied even the fancy of Shakspeare, had he been
<br/>present. All the grace, sprightliness and elegance of a high order
<br/>of acting were here exhibited, and we do not believe there is a
<br/>better Benedick on the stage. We feel highly gratified to see his
<br/>exquisite taste in a wardrobe, and its richness and brilliancy are
<br/>unsurpassed.—Daily Times.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Murdoch was truly successful in the character of Claude.
<br/>By nature he is eminently qualified to perform this part. He has
<br/>all that exuberance of spirits, that overflowing warmth of heart,
<br/>which so well become this humble but aspiring young man, as de-
<br/>picted by the pen of Bulwer. In voice and action we readily and
<br/>spontaneously exclaim, how “express and admirable.” There is
<br/>one charm in the acting of Mr. Murdoch which we could not over-
<br/>look; it is the manner in which he constantly wins upon his audi-
<br/>tors. He never abates or falls off in fascination, but spell after
<br/>spell comes upon them, produced by the witchery of his genius.</p>
                    <p>We say “genius,” and that after full reflection. An actor who
<br/>could thrill the house as he did, near the close of the fourth act,
<br/>must be possessed of powers of the first order. It was no idle
<br/>declamation, but the outpouring of a heart, strung to the highest
<br/>pitch of human passion. He went through the last act with power
<br/>and effect. Some passages of the reading were jewels in them-
<br/>selves; his picture of his palace was described in the finest orato-
<br/>rical voice we ever heard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Murdoch's Claude Melnotte is emphatically a fine specimen
<br/>of acting; and we are confident that hereafter, before a Boston
<br/>audience, he will stand unsurpassed as the representative of that
<br/>character.—Evening Transcript.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Murdoch’s Othello.—The announcement of Mr. Murdoch
<br/>in the difficult character of Othello, on Thursday evening, drew
<br/>together a very large and fashionable audience to the Athenaeum.</p>
                    <p>Taken as a whole, Mr. M’s delineation of the character was fine
<br/>and impressive, and drew down frequent and enthusiastic applause.
<br/>In the earlier parts of the play the tragedian was somewhat re-
<br/>served; and his address to the senate lacked dignity and force.
<br/>But with this scene closed our dissent from his conception and
<br/>delineation. The midnight brawl, rousing the soldier like a trumpet
<br/>from his sleep, seemed to awaken all the fire and fervor of the actor.
<br/>From that moment he gave himself up to the tide of stormy pas-
<br/>sion—of alternate tenderness and hate—doubt and doting—suspi-
<br/>cion, revenge and despair, that make up one of the most terribly
<br/>truthful characters drawn by the pen of the great dramatist. The
<br/>rapid darkling of the noble nature of the Moor—the swift circula-
<br/>tion of the poison instilled by the serpent—the fearful menaces—
<br/>the wavering purposes—the gathered gloom—the fell revenge, and
<br/>the despair more fell yet, of the ruined and betrayed lover and hus-
<br/>band, flashed from the eyes, gestures, attitudes and tears of the actor
<br/>to the hearts and minds of the entire audience. The furious charge
<br/>to Iago—

               <br/>the heart-broken farewell to all the “pomp, pride and circumstance
<br/>of glorious war,” the mingled tenderness, sternness and ruthless-
<br/>ness of the murder scene, and the terrible expiation of the crime,
<br/>were all the most critical could demand. We know not what future
<br/>triumphs Mr. Murdoch has in store, but if he surpasses his
<br/>“Othello,” he will indeed enact wonders.—Times.</p>

<br/>House on the 6th instant. He has published his advertisement
<br/>concerning the Italian Opera Company. The names of the per-
<br/>sons engaged are as follows: Sra. RosinaPicco, Sra. Concepcion

<br/>Lazzarini, second do. ; Sig. Cirilo Antognini, Sig. Luigi Perozzi,

<br/>first baritone; Sig. Attilio Valtelina, first basso; Sig. Antonino
<br/>Sanquirico, first buffo cariato; Sig. Pietro Candi, second basso;
<br/>and six ladies and twelve gentlemen for the choruses. The
<br/>Diario says that Sanquirico was daily expected from Europe, and
<br/>Perozzi, Tomassi and Candi from Mexico. Borghese alone is
<br/>wanted to make it a capital company. When the season termi-
<br/>nates in Havana, the whole troupe design coming here, and may
<br/>open at Palmo’s in April next.</p>

<br/>that it keeps the brains of many an editor at work to find out
<br/>the cause of it. A committee of some of our most respectable

                      <p>Mr. Burke’s Concert, on Tuesday evening last, was attended
<br/>by a most fashionable audience. We have heard the gentleman
<br/>before, but under such disadvantages that we declined giving an
<br/>opinion. We can now safely pronounce him one of the best
<br/>violinists that we have ever heard in this country. His tone is
<br/>solid and marrowy, his bowing is perfect from the mere saltando
<br/>to the staccato, in every manner and shape. He was encored
<br/>after every piece, but declined repeating the Capriccio by Vieux
<br/>Temps, on account of too great previous exertion.</p>                      
                      <p>We cannot say that we are so exceedingly delighted with the
<br/>singing of either Mrs. Andrews or Mr. Zander. Mrs. A. has a
<br/>quite peculiar voice, or rather half-a-dozen of them combined in
<br/>one. Such variety is at times pleasing, but we did not find it so
<br/>in either of the pieces which the lady selected. A peculiar turn
<br/>was introduced by her at every single cadence, and we regret
<br/>exceedingly not having any music type at our command, that we
<br/>might have given it (the turn) to our readers. “Mr. L. T. Zan-
<br/>der, Vocalist from Boston,” announces on the bill his first appear-
<br/>ance in this city. We hope it may be his last.</p>
                      <p>Mr. Burke introduced in his Melange Brillante all the popular
<br/>airs of the day, such as Yankee Doodle, Dandy Jim, Lucy Long,
<br/>etc. During the performance of the last, which, by the bye,
<br/>had a great deal of bowing, the wire on the G string got loose,
<br/>and a passage in Harmonics was spoiled. Many of the audience
<br/>expressed their regret at this accident, at the end of the perform-
<br/>ance. “There is one consolation,” he observed, “it is not the
<br/>only break down in the piece.” Mr. Burke seems to possess a
<br/>good-humor, which, combined with his extraordinary talent,
<br/>cannot fail to win him hosts of friends and admirers. He goes
<br/>to Boston to-morrow, and will return to this city by the 19th of
<br/>January, when he will play at the Philharmonic Concert.</p>

                       <p>Dr. Collier, the eminent Mesmerist, has written to us in refer-
<br/>ence to the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar. We quote a
<br/>portion of his letter:</p>
                       <p>Boston, December 16,1845.</p>
                       <p>Dear Sir—Your account of M. Valdemar’s Case has been uni-
<br/>versally copied in this city, and has created a very great sensation.
<br/>It requires from me no apology, in stating, that I have not the least
<br/>doubt of the possibility of such-a phenomenon; for, I did actually
<br/>restore to active animation a person who died from excessive drink-
<br/>ing of ardent spirits. He was placed in his coffin ready for interment.</p>
                       <p>You are aware that death very often follows excessive excite-
<br/>ment of the nervous system; this arising from the extreme pros-
<br/>tration which follows; so that the vital powers have not sufficient
<br/>energy to react.</p>
                       <p>I will give you the detailed account on your reply to this, which
<br/>I require for publication, in order to put at rest the growing impres-
<br/>sion that your account is merely a splendid creation of your own
<br/>brain, not having any truth in fact. My dear sir, I have battled the
<br/>storm of public derision too long on the subject of Mesmerism, to
<br/>be now found in the rear ranks—though I have not publicly lectured
<br/>for more than two years, I have steadily made it a subject of deep
<br/>investigation.</p>
                       <p>I sent the account to my friend Dr. Elliotson of London ; also to
<br/>the “Zoist,”—to which journal I have regularly contributed.</p>
                       <p>Your early reply will oblige, which I will publish, with your
<br/>consent, in connection with the case I have referred to. Believe
<br/>me yours, most respectfully,</p>

                      <p>We have no doubt that Mr. Collyer is perfectly correct in all
<br/>that he says—and all that he desires us to say—but the truth is,
<br/>there was a very small modicum of truth in the case of
<br/>M. Valdemar—which, in consequence, may be called a hard
<br/>case—very hard for M. Valdemar, for Mr. Collyer, and ourselves.
<br/>If the story was not true, however, it should have been—and
<br/>perhaps “The Zoist” may discover that it is true, after all.</p>

                       <p>The truly beautiful poem entitled “The Mountains,” and
<br/>published in our last Journal, will put every reader in mind of the
<br/>terseness and severe beauty of Macaulay’s best ballads—while it
<br/>surpasses any of them in grace and imagination. Not for years
<br/>has so fine a poem been given to the American public. It is the
<br/>composition of Mr. P. P. Cooke of Virginia, author of “Florence
<br/>Vane,” “Young Rosalie Lee,” and other exquisitely graceful and
<br/>delicate things. Mr. Cooke’s prose, too, is nearly as meritorious
<br/>as his poetry.</p>
                       <p>For the deeply interesting paper “On the Poetical Literature
<br/>of Germany,” (also published in our last number,) we are in-
<br/>debted to Professor T. L. Tellkampf, of Columbia College, in this
<br/>city—brother of the celebrated German poet Adolphus Tellkampf.</p>

                       <p>The Daily News—Speaking of Dickens’ projected paper, thus
<br/>entitled, the correspondent of the Liverpool Chronicle says:</p>
                       <p>I told you some time ago, if I recollect aright, that a new daily
<br/>paper of ultra liberal politics was to be started, with Charles
<br/>Dickens as the editor, and his father as field marshal or conductor.
<br/>Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, the proprietors of Punch, are the
<br/>spirited men ostensibly known in the new paper—that is to be.
<br/>A number of “crack” reporters, all short-hand men, of the metro-
<br/>politan journals, have been engaged, at salaries of seven, eight
<br/>and ten guineas a-week, for three years certain. Dickens is to have
<br/>two thousand a year! Jerrold, Mark Lemon, and others of “mark”
<br/>and “likelihood,” are to be among the chief writers. There is
<br/>plenty of cash in bank, and the parties are all men of undoubted
<br/>honor. After a little “hitch,” the effects of which lasted only
<br/>twenty-four hours, everything has gone on cheeringly. Charles
<br/>Dickens had a dinner party the other day, composed of the principal
<br/>lads engaged; each gentleman invited had come with six names for
<br/>the future journal: after dinner these were discussed with the
<br/>champagne and claret; some of the titles were funny enough, and
<br/>your readers must lose a good laugh by my withholding them. By-
<br/>general consent, “The Daily News” was adopted. The paper is
<br/>to be a rival of the old Whig Morning Chronicle.</p>
                       <p>A capital of £100,000 was required to commence operations—
<br/>so great, in England, is the risk and difficulty of establishing a
<br/>daily paper. The first number will be issued on the first day of
<br/>the new year. Among the collaborators is “an American gen-
<br/>tleman who has acquired much note as a Magazinist,”—possibly
<br/>John Neal.</p>

                       <p>The Boston Post says:</p>
                       <p>We have just learned of a most flattering compliment that has
<br/>been recently paid by a crowned head of Europe to an American
<br/>writer, Mr. A. J. Downing, of Highland Gardens, New York, who
<br/>published, not long since, a most charming book on landscape
<br/>gardening. Mr. Henry Wikoff, who arrived yesterday in the
<br/>Acadia, from Liverpool, has brought over with him an autograph
<br/>letter from the Queen of Holland, together with a magnificent ruby
<br/>ring encircled by three rows of fine diamonds, in acknowledgment
<br/>of the pleasure she had derived from the late perusal of Mr. Down-
<br/>ing’s book. A compliment like this from a royal personage to an
<br/>American author is certainly quite novel, and what enhances its
<br/>value is the new mode made choice of. The gift of a jewel is the
<br/>familiar form that a crowned head usually selects to express royal
<br/>approbation, but it is the first instance of the kind we know of
<br/>where an autograph letter was added to give a stronger emphasis to<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>such a testimonial. We record with great pleasure this marked
<br/>compliment to the talents of a fellow countryman, and congratulate
<br/>Mr. Wikoff upon his honorable commission.</p>
                       <p>For our own parts we are glad that Mr. Downing has received
<br/>the ring—especially as it consists of diamonds and rubies and
<br/>has, therefore, much intrinsic value. We use the words “in-
<br/>trinsic value” not rigorously, but in distinction from the facti-
<br/>tious value which, in the public eye, appertains to the present as
<br/>that of a monarch—and which in our own sincere opinion is pre-
<br/>cisely nothing at all—unless, indeed, we are to understand that
<br/>the individual monarch, in this case, is a very especial judge of
<br/>the merits of a work on “Landscape Gardening.” What we
<br/>mean to say, is simply this:—that the value of any approbation,
<br/>or any testimony of approbation, for a book, is in the ratio not
<br/>of the worldly eminence, but in that of the judgment and good
<br/>faith of the person who commends.</p>

                       <p>It is with deepest regret that we learn the death of Mrs. Maria
<br/>Brooks, the authoress of “Zophiel.” She died on the 11th of Nov.
<br/>last, at Matanzas, in the island of Cuba, from the debility conse-
<br/>quent upon a severe fit of sickness. Mrs. Brooks was, at the time
<br/>of her decease, about fifty years old. She was born at Medford, in
<br/>this state, and for a considerable period resided in this city. About
<br/>fifteen years ago she visited France and England, and while there
<br/>formed many friendships with distinguished persons in both
<br/>countries, among others with Lafayette, Wordsworth, and Southey.
<br/>Of late years she has resided principally in Matanzas.</p>
                       <p>Mrs. Brooks was one of the most remarkable women that ever
<br/>lived. To great attainments in literature, she joined a powerful and
<br/>original genius, and a character of singular energy and individuality.
<br/>Both in England and the United States, she has been considered by
<br/>all who have read her writings thoughtfully, as unmatched among
<br/>poets of her sex. Southey, who superintended the publication of
<br/>her “Zophiel,” had the most exalted opinion of her powers, and
<br/>pronounced her “the most impassioned and imaginative of all
<br/>poetesses.” When “Zophiel” was published, Charles Lamb wrote
<br/>to a friend, that Southey was trying to pass off the poem as the pro-
<br/>duction of an American woman, as if, he said, “there ever was a
<br/>woman capable of writing such a poem.” This is high praise, but
<br/>it is borne out by the poem itself. It is one of the few compositions
<br/>written during the present century, destined for durable fame. It
<br/>is one of the most original, passionate and harmonious works of im-
<br/>agination ever conceived—and there breathes through the whole the
<br/>vital life of genius. Though it has not been extensively circulated
<br/>in the United States, there are very few American productions
<br/>which shed so much glory on our literature, or which are so often
<br/>quoted abroad as evidences of American genius.</p>
                       <p>That a mind of so much power and brilliancy should have depart-
<br/>ed—that one of the lights of our literature should have been
<br/>quenched, we consider an occasion for the most sincere regret. But
<br/>the image of that mind, stamped on her productions, will not de-
<br/>part. The light that illumines the records of her genius will not
<br/>be quenched. Her memory will never return to the dust; her
<br/>mind, even on earth, will have no grave and no tomb. Silently and
<br/>surely her genius will work its way into the great public heart of
<br/>the country, and her fame grow with time. And we cannot con-
<br/>ceive of the period when an American, in reviewing the causes
<br/>which have conducted to place his country in a proud intellectual
<br/>position, and assisted in giving to it the immortality which springs
<br/>from literature, shall cease to regard with peculiar gratitude and ad-
<br/>miration the name of the authoress of “Zophiel.”</p>
                       <p>The critic who writes this is somewhat given to excess of en-
<br/>thusiasm, and we certainly are very far from agreeing with him
<br/>in his opinion that Mrs. Brooks was “considered by all who
<br/>have read her writings thoughtfully as unmatched among poets
<br/>of her sex.” The author of “Zophiel” was a truly imaginative
<br/>poet, but no one, “who read her writings thoughtfully,” would<div class="pagebreak" id="#page392"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>think of comparing her with Miss Barrett—or even with Mrs.
<br/>Norton. As for Lamb’s pert query—“was there ever a woman
<br/>capable of writing such a poem ?”—it merely proves that Lamb
<br/>had little understanding of the true nature of Poetry—which, ap-
<br/>pealing especially to our sense of Beauty, is, in its very essence,
<br/>feminine. If the greatest poems have not been written by wo-
<br/>men, it is because, as yet, the greatest poems have not been writ-
<br/>ten at all.</p>

         <div class="lg">
            <br/>“Einst ist die Lieben.”
<br/>Who goes so late through wind and night,
<br/>With joyous face and beaming eye,
<br/>His step so firm, his heart so light?
<br/>Means he, with light guitar, Love’s fate to try?
<br/>Ah, youthful bard, trust not the fair!
<br/>Their hearts are ever false and vain;
<br/>Trust not thine eyes, nor bend thine ear!
<br/>Heed not their song, nor wake thy strain!
<br/>For woman’s heart will triumph in thy pain.
<br/>Away false Doubt! the youth replies,
<br/>Damp not thus my soul with sorrow—
<br/>True love from thee forever flies—
<br/>Thy gloomy past shall be my morrow;
<br/>My heart, from thee, no grief shall borrow.<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Thus spoke the bard, then woke the lay;
<br/>To one he sang, whom Love had given
<br/>Again to make men bless the day,
<br/>When first he stole to Earth from Heaven,
<br/>While joined in her, all grace seemed brighter even.
<br/>Now on the winds his sighings rise;
<br/>Beneath the lattice sings the Boy,
<br/>And upwards turns his tender eyes;
<br/>Rise sweetest hopes, and welcome joy,
<br/>While thus Love’s songs the gentle hours employ.
<br/>But pleads the fond Minstrel in vain
<br/>To her heart cold and unfeeling,
<br/>Like that grim lake on Italy’s plain
<br/>Itself’s waters all concealing
<br/>Sinks in the grave its own waves die sealing.
<br/>Now colder blew the midnight blast,
<br/>Hoarse peal the bells in sullen toll,
<br/>The driven snow falls round him fast,
<br/>And fly the hopes that filled his soul,
<br/>Like the dark clouds that swiftly o’er him roll.
<br/>Through the tall and quaint old trees
<br/>Down sheds the light its mellowed gleam;
<br/>Like silvery moonlit seas,
<br/>Or diamond’s glittering beam,
<br/>Their snow-hung branches round him shining seem.
<br/>Two starry tears in silence fall,
<br/>Congealed they fasten on the string
<br/>That woke so oft Love’s sweetest call—
<br/>No more for thee may lovers sing—
<br/>And dead the tones that told their suffering.</div>

<br/>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office, 446
<br/>Houston st., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
<br/>Church.
<br/>Doct. S.’s experience and skill in his profession give him confi-
<br/>dence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Den-
<br/>tist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies
<br/>in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in
<br/>pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many difficult
<br/>cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists of estab-
<br/>lished professional reputation, and whose prices for the same opera-
<br/>tion were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth
<br/>is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth,
<br/>both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appear-
<br/>ance. In all these points, Dr. S.’s manner is pre-eminent. His
<br/>mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to surmount many
<br/>obstacles, which have long, with the profession generally, impeded
<br/>the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the best
<br/>materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has
<br/>fallen away by absorption, (which is always the case, more or less,
<br/>when teeth have been extracted,) which causes a contraction of the
<br/>lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of which cannot be fully obviated
<br/>without adopting the artificial gums, which will supply the de-
<br/>ficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their
<br/>beauty and natural appearance render detection impossible.
<br/>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
<br/>the best families in this City, in which he has practised.
<br/>Ladies who desire it, can have their teeth examined at their resi-
<br/>dences, by sending their address as above.	nov8—9t</div>

<br/>NARRATIVE OF A MISSION TO BOKHARA,
<br/>In the year 1843-45, to ascertain the fate of Col. Stoddart and
<br/>Capt. Conolly.
<br/>By the Rev. Joseph Wolff, LL.D.
<br/>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<br/>England; it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<br/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<br/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<br/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<br/>East. No man living, perhaps, has traveled so extensively as this
<br/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<br/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.
<br/>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<br/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-

<br/>tribes and nations of which we know so little To say that the
<br/>work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming
<br/>far too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought to
<br/>be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for its
<br/>quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work is
<br/>elegantly printed as a library book, and aderned by some dozen curi-
<br/>ous fac-similes of oriental drawings.”—Courier and Enquirer.</div>

<br/>“Praed was the Poet of Society, 'a fellow of infinite humor,’ and
<br/>in scholarship and art, surpassed by none of the English poets of

         <div class="ab">THE SECOND VOLUME OF
<br/>THE ARISTIDEAN:
<br/>A JOURNAL OF REVIEWS, POLITICS, AND LIGHT LIT-
<br/>ERATURE—By Thomas Dunn English, and numerous col-
<br/>laborators—commences on the 20th of January, 1846.
<br/>The Aristidean is published monthly, each number containing
<br/>80 pages, octavo, printed on handsome white paper, with bold, clear
<br/>type, at Five Dollars per annum, payable in advance.
<br/>The aim of the editor has been to establish a Journal of Art and
<br/>Letters, whose papers should be distinguished for force, vigor, sar-
<br/>casm and pith, rather than an unutterable and bathetic profundity;
<br/>one, which should not fear to expose literary quackery, and give to
<br/>writers a proper precedence; one that had the moral courage to
<br/>praise an enemy’s good works, and censure a friend’s bad ones; one
<br/>that would maintain a rigorous independence on literary, political
<br/>and religious matters; one that would attack all abuses without
<br/>scruple; one that was insensible to fear, and deaf to favor; and one
<br/>that depended for success on the merit of its papers, and not on the
<br/>names announced as contributors. If the editor may judge from the
<br/>high panegyric of the press, and the more substantial evidence of an
<br/>increasing subscription list, he has succeeded in his intention.
<br/>Those desiring to sustain an independent and fearless magazine
<br/>will be kind enough to remit their subscriptions by mail, rather
<br/>than through an agent.

<br/>* Caution.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
<br/>market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
<br/>the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
<br/>that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so per-
<br/>ceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.
<br/>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<br/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<br/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<br/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less prica
<br/>than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
<br/>Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
<br/>which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
<br/>colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
<br/>Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
<br/>Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let pur-
<br/>chasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
<br/>venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
<br/>Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
<br/>per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
<br/>Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
<br/>poison. The company have published a book, giving full details on
<br/>this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
<br/>free of charge.
<br/>Recommendations.
<br/>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
<br/>dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
<br/>now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
<br/>pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
<br/>and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
<br/>Company, say we.—[Mirror.
<br/>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
<br/>and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
<br/>poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
<br/>of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fra-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>grant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
<br/>Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea ware-
<br/>house, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
<br/>that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.
<br/>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
<br/>teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Com-
<br/>pany, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
<br/>greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
<br/>the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
<br/>to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.
<br/>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
<br/>obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
<br/>ware-rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as
<br/>delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.
<br/>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of
<br/>the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—[Mercury.
<br/>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<br/>street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dol-
<br/>lars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
<br/>Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chi-
<br/>nese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
<br/>establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
<br/>good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
<br/>who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
<br/>on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.
<br/>The Pekin Tea Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
<br/>of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
<br/>great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
<br/>proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
<br/>public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
<br/>is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been com-
<br/>pelled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
<br/>effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
<br/>the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
<br/>an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
<br/>The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice
<br/>varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
<br/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
<br/>into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
<br/>have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we es-
<br/>pecially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
<br/>those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
<br/>who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
<br/>can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
<br/>a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
<br/>company's warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.
<br/>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75Fulton street, unquestionably
<br/>sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
<br/>cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
<br/>instances since they have opened their store.
<br/>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
<br/>wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
<br/>entitled “Hints to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
<br/>information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[Anglo-
