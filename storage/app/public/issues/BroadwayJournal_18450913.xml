            <br></br>In these rapid, restless shadows,
            
            <br></br>Once I walked at eventide,
            
            <br></br>When a gentle, silent maiden,
            
            <br></br>Walked in beauty at my side.
            
            <br></br>She alone there walked beside me
            
            <br></br>All in beauty, like a bride.
            
            <br></br>Pallidly the moon was shining
            
            <br></br>On the dewy meadows nigh;
            
            <br></br>On the silvery, silent rivers,
            
            <br></br>On the mountains far and high,--
            
            <br></br>On the ocean's star-lit waters,
            
            <br></br>Where the winds a-weary die.
            
            <br></br>Slowly, silently we wandered
            
            <br></br>From the open cottage door,
            
            <br></br>Underneath the elm's long branches
            
            <br></br>To the pavement bending o'er;
            
            <br></br>Underneath the mossy willow
            
            <br></br>And the dying sycamore.
            
            <br></br>With the myriad stars in beauty
            
            <br></br>All bedight, the heavens were seen
            
            <br></br>Radiant hopes were bright around me,
            
            <br></br>Like the light of stars serene;
            
            <br></br>Like the mellow midnight splendor
            
            <br></br>Of the Night's irradiate queen.
            
            <br></br>Audibly the elm leaves whispered
            
            <br></br>Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
            
            <br></br>Like the distant murmured music
            
            <br></br>Of unquiet, lovely seas;
            
            <br></br>While the winds were hushed in slumber
            
            <br></br>In the fragrant flowers and trees.
            
            <br></br>Wondrous and unwonted beauty
            
            <br></br>Still adorning all did seem,
            
            <br></br>While I told my love in fables
            
            <br></br>'Neath the willows by the stream;
            
            <br></br>Would the heart had kept unspoken
            
            <br></br>Love that was its rarest dream!
            
            <br></br>Instantly away we wandered
            
            <br></br>In the shadowy twilight tide,
            
            <br></br>She, the silent, scornful maiden,
            
            <br></br>Walking calmly at my side,
            
            <br></br>With a step serene and stately,
            
            <br></br>All in beauty, all in pride.
            
            <br></br>Vacantly I walked beside her,
            
            <br></br>On the earth mine eyes were cast;
            
            <br></br>Swift and keen there came unto me
            
            <br></br>Bitter memories of the past--
            
            <br></br>On me," like the rain in Autumn
            
            <br></br>On the dead leaves, cold and fast.
            
            <br></br>Underneath the elms we parted,]
            
            <br></br>By the lowly^cottage door;
            
            <br></br>One brief word alone was uttere--
            
            <br></br>Never on our lips before;
            
            
            <br></br>And away I walked forlornly,
            
            <br></br>Broken-hearted evermore.
            
            <br></br>Slowly, silently I loitered,
            
            <br></br>Homeward, in the night, alone;
            
            <br></br>Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
            
            <br></br>That my youth had never known;
            
            <br></br>Wild unrest, like that which cometh
            
            <br></br>When the Night's first dream hath flown.
            
            <br></br>Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
            
            <br></br>Mad, discordant melodies,
            
            <br></br>And keen memories like shadows
            
            <br></br>Haunt the moaning willow trees,
            
            <br></br>And the sycamores with laughter
            
            <br></br>Mock me in the nightly breeze.
            
            <br></br>Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
            
            <br></br>Through the sighing foliage streams;
            
            <br></br>And each morning, midnight shadow,
            
            <br></br>Shadow of my sorrow seems;
            
            <br></br>Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!
            
            <br></br>And, O soul, forget thy dreams!

         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>Hey, diddle diddle,
            
            <br></br>The cat and the fiddle.
            
         </div>
         
         <p>Since the world began there have been two Jeremys. The one wrote a Jeremiad about
            usury, and was called 
            <span class="person" id="jbentham">Jeremy Bentham</span>. He has been much admired by Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="jneal">John Neal</span>,
            and was a great man in a small way. The other gave name to the most important of
            the Exact Sciences, and was a great man in a great way--I may say, indeed, in the very
            greatest of ways.
         </p>
         
         <p>Diddling--or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle--is sufficiently well
            understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing diddling, is somewhat difficult to
            define. We may get, however, at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in
            hand, by defining--not the thing, diddling, in itself--but man, as an animal that
            diddles. Had 
            <span class="person" id="plato">Plato</span> but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the
            picked chicken.
         </p>
         
         <p>Very pertinently it was demanded of 
            <span class="person" id="plato">Plato</span>, why a picked chicken, which was clearly a
            "biped without feathers," was not, according to his own definition, a man? But I am
            not. to be bothered by any similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, and
            there is no animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire hen-coop of picked
            chickens to get over that.
         </p>
         
         <p>What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling is, in fact,
            peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons. A crow theives; a
            fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles. To diddle is his destiny, "Man was
            made to mourn," says the poet. But not so:-- he was made to diddle. This is his
            aim--his ob ect--his end
            And for this reason when a man's diddled we say he's "done."
         </p>
         
         <p>Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the ingredients are
            minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity, audacity, nonchalance, originality,
            impertinence, and grin.
         </p>
         
         <p>Minuteness:--Your diddler is minute. His operations are upon a small scale. His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper at sight. Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation, he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes what we term "financier." This latter
            word conveys the diddling idea in every respect except that of magnitude. A
            diddler may thus be regarded as a banker in petto--a "financial operation," as a
            diddle at Brobdignag. The one is to the other, as 
            <span class="person" id="homer">Homer</span> to 
            <span class="person" id="tward">"Flaccus"</span>--as a Mastodon to a mouse--as the tail of a comet to that of a pig.
         </p>
         
         <p>Interest:--Your diddler is guided by self-interest. He scorns to diddle for the mere
            sake of the diddle. He has an object in view--his pocket--and yours. He regards always
            the main chance. He looks to Number One. You are Number Two, and must look to
            yourself.
         </p>
         
         <p>Perseverance:--Your diddler perseveres. He is not readily discouraged.
            Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about it. He steadily pursues his end,
            and
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,
            
         </div>
         
         <p>so he never lets go of his game.</p>
         
         <p>Ingenuity:--Your diddler is ingenious. He has constructiveness large. He understands plot. He invents and circumvents. Were he not Alexander he
            would be Diogenes. Were he not a diddler, he would be a maker of patent rattraps or an angler for trout.
         </p>
         
         <p>Audacity:--Your diddler is audacious.--He is a bold man. He carries the war into
            Africa. He conquers all by assault. He would not tear the daggers of the Frey Herren.
            With a little more prudence Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a
            trifle less blarney, Daniel O'Connell; with a pound or two more brains, Charles the
            Twelfth.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nonchalance:--Your diddler is nonchalant. He is not at all nervous. He never had any nerves. He is never seduced into a flurry. He is never put out--unless
            put out of doors. He is cool--cool as a cucumber. He is calm-- "calm as a smile
            from Lady Bury." He is easy--easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient Baiæ.
         </p>
         
         <p>Originality:--Your diddler is original--conscientiously so. His thoughts are his own.
            He would scorn to employ those of another. A stale trick is his aversion. He would
            return a purse, I am sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an
            unoriginal diddle.
         </p>
         
         <p>Impertinence:--Your diddler is impertinent. He swaggers. He sets his
            arms a-kimbo. He thrusts his hands in his trowsers' pockets. He sneers in your face.
            He treads on your corns. He eats your dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows
            your money, he pulls your nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife.
         </p>
         
         <p>Grin:--Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. But this nobody sees but himself.
            He grins when his daily work is done--wken his allotted labors are accomplished--at
            night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. He goes home. He locks his door. He divests himself of his clothes. He puts out his candle. He gets into bed. He places his head upon the
            pillow. All this done, and your diddler grins. This is no hypothesis. It is a matter of course. I reason à priori, and a diddle would be no diddle
            without a grin.
         </p>
         
         <p>The origin of the diddle is referrible to the infancy of the Human Race. Perhaps the
            first diddler was Adam. At
            all events, we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity.
            The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. Without pausing to speak of the "old saws," therefore, I shall content myself with a compendious account of
            some of the more "modern instances."
         </p>
         
         <p>A very good diddle is this. A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for instance, is seen
            to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses. At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. She is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble individual at the door. She finds a sofa well
            adapted to her views, and, upon inquiring the price, is surprised
            and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent, lower than her
            expectations. She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and receipt, leaves her
            address, with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper. The night arrives and no sofa. The next day passes, and still none. A servant is
            sent to make inquiry about the delay. The whole transaction is denied. No sofa has been sold--no money received--except by the diddler who played
            shop-keeper for the nonce.
         </p>
         
         <p>Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus afford every facility
            for a trick of this kind. Visiters enter, look at furniture, and depart unheeded and
            unseen. Should any one wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient.
         </p>
         
         <p>Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. A well-dressed individual enters a shop;
            makes a purchase to the value of a dollar; finds, much to his vexation, that he has
            left his pocket-book in another coat pocket: and so says to the shop-keeper--
         </p>
         
         <p>"My dear sir, never mind!--just oblige me, will you, by sending the bundle home?
            But stay! I really believe that I have nothing less than a five dollar bill, even there. However, you can send four dollars in change with the bundle,
            you know."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Very good, sir," replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. "I know fellows, he says to
            himself, "who would just have put the goods under their arm, and walked off
            with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon."
         </p>
         
         <p>A boy is sent with the parcel and change. On the route, quite accidentally, he is
            met by the purchaser, who exclaims:
         </p>
         
         <p>"Ah! this is my bundle, I see--I thought you had been home with it, long ago. Well,
            go on! My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you the five dollars--I left instructions
            with her to that effect. The change you might as well give to me--I shall want
            some silver for the Post Office. Very good! One, two,--is this a good quarter?--three,
            four-- quite right! Say to Mrs. Trotter that you met me, and be sure now and do
            not loiter on the way."
         </p>
         
         <p>The boy does n't loiter at all--but he is a very long time in getting back from his
            errand--for no lady of the precise name of Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered. He consoles himself, however, that he has not been such a fool as to leave
            the goods without the money, and re-entering his shop with a self satisfied air,
            feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the
            change.
         </p>
         
         <p>A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. The captain of a ship which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking person, with an unusually moderate
            bill of city charges. Glad to get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties
            pressing upon him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. In about fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him by
            one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler, and the original collection a diddle.
         </p>
         
         <p>And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. A steamboat is casting loose from the
            wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running towards the wharf at
            full speed. Suddenly, he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from
            the ground in a very agitated manner. It is a pocket book, and--"Has any gentleman lost a pocket book?" he cries. No one can say that he has exactly
            lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat however, must not be detained.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Time and tide wait for no man," says the captain.</p>
         
         <p>"For God's sake, stay only a few minutes," says the finder of the
            book--"the true claimant will presently appear."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Can't wait!" replies the man in authority; "cast off there, d'ye hear?"</p>
         
         <p>"What am I to do?" asks the finder, in great tribulation. "I am about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot conscientiously retain this large
            amount in my possession. I beg your pardon, sir," [here he addresses a gentleman on
            shore,] "but you have the air of an honest man. Will you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocketbook--I know I can trust you--and of
            advertising it? The notes, you see, amount to a very considerable sum. The owner
            will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding you for your trouble--"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Me!--no, you!--it was you who found the book."</p>
         
         <p>"Well, if you must have it so--I will take a small reward--just to
            satisfy your scruples. Let me see--why these notes are all hundreds--bless my soul! a
            hundred is too much to take--fifty would be quite enough, I am sure--"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Cast off there!" says the captain.</p>
         
         <p>"But then I have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole, you had better"--</p>
         
         <p>"Cast off there!" says the captain.</p>
         
         <p>"Never mind!" cries the gentleman on shore, who has been examining his own
            pocket-book for the last minute or so--"never mind! I can fix it--here is a fifty on
            the Bank of North America--throw me the book."
         </p>
         
         <p>And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked
            reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while the steamboat fumes
            and fizzes on her way. In about half an hour after her departure, the "large amount"
            is seen to be "a counterfeit presentment," and the whole thing a capital
            diddle.
         </p>
         
         <p>A bold diddle is this. A camp-meeting, or something similar, is to be held at a
            certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge. A diddler stations
            himself upon this bridge, respectfully informs all passers by of the new county
            law, which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for horses and
            donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. Some grumble but all submit, and the diddler
            goes home a wealthier man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned. This
            taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.
         </p>
         
         <p>A neat diddle is this. A friend holds one of the diddler's promises to pay, filled
            up and signed in due form, upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink. The diddler
            purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in
            his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche. The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with the diddler's dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion. The friend produces it
            from his escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when up jumps
            the diddler's dog and devours it forthwith. The diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog, and expresses
            his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming.
         </p>
         
         <p>A very minute diddle is this. A lady is insulted in the street by a diddler's
            accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing, insists upon attending the lady to her own door.
            He bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu. She
            entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and
            her papa. With a sigh, he declines to do so. "Is there no way, then, sir," she
            murmurs, "in which I may be permitted to testify my gratitude?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why, yes, madam, there is. Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings?"</p>
         
         <p>In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting
            outright. Upon second thought, however, she opens her purse-strings and delivers the
            specie. Now this, I say, is a diddle minute--for one entire moiety of the sum
            borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of
            performing the insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing
            it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Rather a small, but still a scientific diddle is this. The diddler approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of tobacco. These are
            handed to him, when, having slightly examined them, he says:
         </p>
         
         <p>"I don't much like this tobacco. Here, take it back, and give me a glass of brandy
            and water in its place."
         </p>
         
         <p>The brandy and water is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the
            door. But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water."</p>
         
         <p>"Pay for my brandy and water!--didn't I give you the tobacco for the brandy and
            water? What more would you have?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"But sir, if you please, I don't remember that you paid for the tobacco."</p>
         
         <p>"What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?--Didn't I give you back your tobacco? Is
            n't that your tobacco lying there? Do you expect me to pay for what I did not
            take?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"But, sir," says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say, "but, sir--"</p>
         
         <p>"But me no buts, sir," interrupts the diddler, apparently in very high dudgeon, and
            slamming the door after him, as he makes his escape.--"But me no buts, sir, and none
            of your tricks upon travellers."
         </p>
         
         <p>Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is not its least
            recommendation. A purse, or pocket-book, being really lost, the loser inserts in one
            of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement.
         </p>
         
         <p>Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement, with a
            change of heading, of general phraseology, and address. The original, for instance,
            is long, and verbose, is headed "A Pocket-Book Lost!" and requires the treasure,
            when found, to be left at No. 1 Tom street. The copy is brief, and being headed
            with "Lost" only, indicates No. 2 Dick, or No. 3 Harry street, as the locality at
            which the owner may be seen. Moreover, it is inserted in at least
            five or six of the daily papers of the day, while in point of time, it makes it appearance only a few hours after the original. Should it be read by the
            loser of the purse, he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own
            misfortune. But, of course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder
            will repair to the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. The former pays the reward, pockets the
            treasure and decamps.
         </p>
         
         <p>Quite an analogous diddle is this. A lady of ton has dropped, somewhere in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value. For its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars reward--giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of the gem, and of its
            settings, and declaring that, upon its restoration to No. so and so, in such and such Avenue, the reward will be paid instanter, without a single
            question being asked. During the lady's absence from home, a day or two
            afterwards, a ring is heard at the door of No. so and so, in such and such Avenue; a
            servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be out, at
            which astounding information, the visitor expresses the most poignant regret.
            His business is of importance and concerns the lady herself. In fact, he had the good
            fortune to find her diamond ring. But, perhaps it would be as well that he
            should call again. "By no means!" says the servant; and "By no means!" says the lady's sister and the lady's sisterin-law, who are summoned forthwith. The ring is clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and
            the finder nearly thrust out of doors. The lady returns, and expresses some
            little dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they happen to
            have paid forty or fifty dollars for a facsimile of her diamond ring--a facsimile made
            out of real pinchbeck and unquestionable paste.
         </p>
         
         <p>But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none to this essay,
            were I even to hint at half the variations, or inflections, of which this science is
            susceptible. I must bring this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot
            do better than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather elaborate
            diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success, in other still more verdant
            localities of the Union. A middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts
            unknown. He is remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his demeanor.
            His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain, unostentatious. He wears a white cravat,
            an ample waistcoat, made with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking
            shoes, and pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air, in fact, of your
            well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable "man of business," par
            excellence--one of the stern and outwardly hard, internally soft, sort of people
            that we see in the crack high comedies-- fellows whose words are so many bonds, and
            who are noted for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in
            the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing, with the
            other.
         </p>
         
         <p>He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house. He dislikes children. He has been accustomed to quiet. His habits are methodical--and
            then he would prefer getting into a private and respectable small family,
            piously inclined. Terms, however, are no object-- only he must insist upon settling
            his bill on the first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his landlady,
            when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any account, to forget his
            instructions upon this point--but to send in a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten
            o'clock, on the first day of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to
            the second.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a reputable rather
            than in a fashionable quarter of the town. There is nothing he more despises than
            pretence. "Where there is much show," he says, "there is seldom anything very solid behind"--an observation which so profoundly impresses his
            landlady's fancy, that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of 
            <span class="person" id="solomon">Solomon</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p>The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this, in the principal
            business sixpennies of this city--the pennies are eschewed as not "respectable"--and as demanding payment for all advertisements in advance. Our man of
            business holds it as a point of his faith that work should never be paid for
            until done.
         </p>
         
         <p>Wanted.--The advertisers, being about to commence extensive business operations in this city, will require the services of three or four
            intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal salary will be paid. The very best recommendations, not so much for capacity, as for integrity, will
            be expected. Indeed, as the duties to he performed, involve high
            responsibilities, and large amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands
            of those engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from
            each clerk employed. No person need apply, therefore, who is not prepared to
            leave this sum in the possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most
            satisfactory testimonials of morality. Young gentlemen piously inclined will be
            preferred. Application should be made between the hours of ten and eleven, A. M., and
            four and five, P. M., of Messrs. Boggs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, &amp; Co.
         </p>
         
         <div class="ab">No. 110 Dog Street.</div>
         
         <p>By the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has brought to the office
            of Messrs. Boggs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs and Company, some fifteen or twenty young
            gentlemen piously inclined. But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a
            contract with any--no man of business is ever precipitate--and it is not until the most
            rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each young gentleman's inclination,
            that his services are engaged and his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Boggs,
            Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and Company. On the morning of the first day of the next month, the landlady does not present her bill according to promise--a piece
            of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in
            ogs, would no doubt have chided her severely, could he have been prevailed upon to
            remain in town a day or two for that purpose.
         </p>
         
         <p>As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running hither and thither, and
            all they can do is to declare the man of business most emphatically, a "hen knee
            high"--by which some persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n.e.i.--by
            which again the very classical phrase non est inventus, is supposed to be understood.
            In the meantime the young gentlemen, one and all, are somewhat less piously
            inclined than before, while the landlady purchases a shilling's worth of the
            best Indian rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that some
            fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of

            <br></br>Oh! not for one, or each
            
            <br></br>Of these bright gifts--thine all--
            
            <br></br>Thou livest ever in our speech--
            
            <br></br>Our blessings on thee fall,--
            
            <br></br>But for thine timer self--
            
            <br></br>The graces deeper set
            
            <br></br>The wealth more worth than glittering pelf'
            
            <br></br>Gem, crown, or coronet.
            
            
            <br></br>For the ennobled mind
            
            <br></br>With generous feelings fraught,
            
            <br></br>Rich gifts of intellect, combined
            
            <br></br>With pure and tender thought--
            
            <br></br>The gentle heart, imbued
            
            <br></br>With charity for all--
            
            <br></br>The lofty soul--high, yet subdued
            
            <br></br>To pity's softest call.
            
            <br></br>The love for all are near--
            
            <br></br>The self-forgetfulness--
            
            <br></br>These are the trraits that make thee dear
            
            <br></br>For these, thyself we bless.
            
            <br></br>For these, till life departs,
            
            <br></br>Through weal and woe the same.
            
            <br></br>Of Earth's the deepest on our hearts
            
            <br></br>Graven shall be thy name.

         ACT. II.
         
         <p>Scene First.--The drawingroom at in Act 1, Scene 1. Enter Catharine, followed by
            Dulruse.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. You carry your presumption, sir, rather too far for a gentleman. Or, are
            you so dull you cannot take a hint?
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. So devoted that I will not take it. You have left the other room, Miss Clairvoir, to avoid me; and I have followed, because I will not be
            avoided.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. Sir! sir!</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. I say so, Miss Catharine. Love is not so easily repulsed.</p>
         
         <p>Cath. This is too insolent! Leave me, sir, this instant: and, for your odious
            pretensions--
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. But--</p>
         
         <p>Cath. Odious pretensions, sir,--if you dare repeat them, my father shall forbid you
            the house. Go, sir.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Madam, I cannot see what you mean by odious. If a sincere and respectful
            adoration--
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. Of twenty-five thousand dollars and large expectations--</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. You mistake, you mistake. It is yourself, your bewitching
            person, your exalted character, that I adore; money is of no consideration,
            where--
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. It is so inconsiderable as with Miss Mildmay. Her poor five thousand, sir,
            are quite beneath the regards of an aspirer like Mr. Arnold Dulruse.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. [Aside.] Damnation!</p>
         
         <p>Cath. You might as well swear louder, Mr. Dulruse. If you are ashamed that your
            meanness is detected, go and repeat it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Miss Clairvoir, do not be so hasty! Hear me. I did indeed once love your
            cousin--
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. Oh sir!</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. But was it possible, when you were present--</p>
         
         <p>Cath. To adore her longer? No! [Affecting pompousness.] Who sees the stars when
            the moon is in her glory? and when the golden sun arises in the orient, is not her
            silver round unnoticed in the west? Is that the style, sir? Gold and silver, you
            see: a great difference. There; you now perceive that you are laughed at, and you turn pale with rage. To be serious: have you forgotten that there
            is a person in the world by the name of Walton?
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. But my mother--</p>
         
         <p>Cath. Your mother?</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Don't speak so scornfully, Miss Clairvoir; that mother may bo yours before
            long; yes, will be. Who is pale now? Come, Miss Catharine, let us talk reason. I
            have not only my m other's assurance--
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. But also your own, which is fully equal.</p>
         
         
         <p>Dulr. But also your father approves of my passion. You may look incredulous. And what is more, he has not only taken me into favor, but Mr. Walton, he
            declares, shall never have you.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cath. It is false; false as your pretended passion. I shall ask him this instant. [As she is going to the door, Dulruse puts himself in the way.] Stand
            out of my way, sir.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. But hear me.</p>
         
         <p>Cath. Let me pass, this instant, as you value your safety. I have been, I see, too
            backward, too forbearing. I wished to spare Miss Mildmay's feelings, and I was
            silent; I did not care to involve Mr. Walton in a quarrel, and I forbore to tell
            him; and, for the sake of all concerned, I have withheld your preposterous and insulting declarations from Mr. Clairvoir: but, since this is misunderstood, my patience is at an end; and the next word that you dare
            address me on this subject, you shall hear your answer from one that will make
            more impression on you. Let me pass, sir. [Exit.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. And the devil go with you, for a pert, insolent, purseproud--Damnation! [Exit.]</p>
         
         <p>Scene II.--The dining-room at Mr. Clairvoir s. Enter Letty, looking
            for something.
         </p>
         
         <p>Letty. [Singing.]</p>
         
         <p>"Still so gently o'er me stealing, Memory will bring back the feeling"--</p>
         
         <p>Enter Dulruse. He starts, looks pleased, then goes behind her cautiously, and, as
            she concludes the second verse, puts his hand about her waist.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. [Mimicking.] Fee-e-ling!</p>
         
         <p>Lett. With a vengeance! [Extricating herself with a show of anger.] You are very
            free, Mr. Dulruse.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. I always am, my dear; quite at home with such pretty rogues as you. Delicious song, that,--must have left quite a bouquet on your lips: let
            me taste it. [Attempting to kiss her ]
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. [Boxing his ears violently ] There, take that! And if you're so fond of bouquets, sir, you'd better let Miss Mildmay furnish you: you 'll find
            too many thorns about my posy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Hark you, child! you may think yourself vastly witty; but, let me tell you,
            you are damned saucy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. I came to look for Miss Clairvoir's fan, sir, not to meet you. And now I've
            found it, I wish you more manners, and a good afternoon. [Curtsies contemptuously
            and is about to leave the room. Dulr. lays hold of her arm, and, in their
            struggles, he comes with his back against the door and closes it] Let me go, sir,
            you'd better, for your own reputation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Yours, you mean. The door is now shut, hussy; and, if you'd have me forgive
            you that blow, you'll leave these airs for your betters.
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. My betters, sir! And who are they? Not you, nor your mother, I can tell
            you. Let me go.
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. You are very pert.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. You are very impertinent.</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. For a chambermaid, my little black-eyed vixen, you have--</p>
         
         <p>Lett. Too much penetration not to see through such a shallow ditch as you.</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Come, come! my angel of the bedquilts; though your eyes do flash fire--</p>
         
         <p>Lett. They would find it hard to influence such a mouldy bit of tinder as you are.
            And so--[Struggling.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Take that, Miss Impudence. [ Trying to kiss her.]</p>
         
         <p>Lett. No; that, Mr. Fool! [Trusting the fan in his face.]</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. Damn it, you minx; this is carrying the joke too far.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. Not farther, sir, than Miss Clairvoir did for you a minute ago. [Dulr. in
            confusion, lets go her arm. Letty opens the door.] You have a high notion of your
            own capacity, Mr. Dulruse; three women at once. And yet, let me tell you, you have
            n't heart enough for one of them, though you have effrontery enough for all
            three. [He springs at her. She darts through the doorway. Then, seeing him
            pause, Letty puts back her head into the room.] And now hear a last word, sir,
            which, for your sake, more than my own, I wont speak as loud as you obliged Miss
            Clairvoir to do:
            He that has n't wit enough to make the mistress listen, need not think to come
            over the maid; and the man that is so base as to cheat one lady and lie to another, is just worthy to attempt the honor of a poor servingmaid, but is too
            contemptible to put it ever in peril. Good day, sir. [Curtsies low, and exit, singing significantly,--while he stands unable to move, from confusion
            and rage:]
         </p>
         
         <p>"but my feelings I smother: O thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my mother!"</p>
         
         <p>Dulr. [After a moment.] Bit on every side, by Haeven! [Exit, clenching his
            hands.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Scene Third.--St. John's Square. The enclosure is seen. Enter, on
            the outside, Walton, walking leisurely, and in the opposite direction,
            Gantelet. Gantelet, as he comes in front of Mr. Walton, touches
            his hat respectfully; Walton returns the salute, and is about to pass, but checks
            himself suddenly.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. So, Gantelet; is that you?</p>
         
         <p>Gant. Aat Monsieur Walton sareveece. [Bowing.]</p>
         
         <p>Walt. Your master has returned then?</p>
         
         <p>Gant. No, sare; Monsieur Rontolph haas stop aat Philadelphie.</p>
         
         <p>Walt. And sent you on. I should not have thought, my good Gantelet, that he could
            have spared you.
         </p>
         
         <p>Gant. [Bowing humbly.] Monsieur is ver' complaison: de pauvre Gantelet is note
            really wort' not ting.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. When does he return?</p>
         
         <p>Gant. Dis eveneeng, sare: he stay aat Philadelphia for soam leetel affaire, soam
            bagatelle, and senda me on, in de morning, wid all hees effaics--hees bags, hees
            portmanteau, hees fusil, hees every ting.
         </p>
         
         <p>Wall. Did you leave Mr. Racy at bis lodgings?</p>
         
         <p>Gant. Mon, monsieur. Ah! I me recall in dis moment, Monsieur Raacie waas gone out, all exprès for to see Monsieur Wultone.</p>
         
         <p>Walt. To see me? When? how long ago?</p>
         
         <p>Gant. Wan, two, tree minoot; ver' leetel vile.</p>
         
         <p>Walt. How unfortunate! I was just going to him. Well, if you should meet him,
            Gantelet, tell Mr. Racy that he will find me at his lodgings.
         </p>
         
         <p>Gant. Oui, monsieur. [He touches his hat respectfully, as Mr. Wal- ton moves on,
            and is about to depart in the opposite direction, when
         </p>
         
         <p>Enter Letty, in great haste, from the side at which Gantelet first appeared, i.
            e., facing Mr. Walton. She moves directly up to the tatler; and Gantelet stops to
            watch the meeting.
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. O, Mr. Walton; I am so rejoiced to meet you, sir!</p>
         
         <p>Wall. Well, Letty, what is the matter? Take breath. You need not wait, Gantelet.
            [Gant, behind Mr. Walton's back, shakes his fist at Letty, who smiles in return
            maliciously. Exit Gant.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. Oh, sir, I have just been, as fast as I could go, to Mr. Racy's, and not
            finding him at home, I thought I would take the liberty to go to you; and I am so
            glad I lave met you, sir! There have been such doings at our house! [Fans herself
            with her apron.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. What? Quick!</p>
         
         <p>Lett. Why, sir, there is Miss Mildmay, all in tears, poor thing and Miss
            Catharine--[running.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. For Heaven's sake!</p>
         
         <p>Lett. So distressed! I beg pardon. You must know, Mr. Walton, that Mr. Clairvoir--I
            really don't know how to tell you.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. Letty! this is worse than murder: speak out, at once.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. Then, sir, the truth is, the devil is in the matter. [ Untying the strings of her bonnet, and fanning violently.] Mr. Clairvoir has
            actually forbidden Miss Catharine to think any more about you.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. You dream.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. I wish I did, sir; and that we all did; but the only dreamers
            are Miss Catharine's father and Mrs. Dulruse, and that wretch, Mr. Dulruse, is at
            the bottom of the whole business.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. Go on, go on; though I scarcely can believe you.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. Yet it is true, sir. It seems that you have said something about their silly
            magnetism that has displeased the old gentleman. He and the housekeeper have been
            talking about it over and over again this afternoon. What was said, I don't know;
            but suddenlyMr. Clairvoir comes out of the room, crying out, in a very determined tone, "I'll do it": he sees me on the stairs, tells me to call Miss Catharine: so I did; they had a conversation together; I felt uneasy; I could not help entering the room; and I heard Mr. Clairvoir tell Miss
            Catharine "that she was not to think of you any more, but he would provide a
            husband that had more brains, and was more worthy of her." Excuse me sir, they are
            his words, no ideas of mine.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. Never mind; go on.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. The rest, sir, is very little. The old man leaves the room, and I went out
            too; and before I got up stairs I saw Mr. Dulruse go in. Now you must know, sir--
            But-- No, it's right that I should tell you. Mr. Dulruse, sir, has been making love
            to Miss Clairvoir for more than a week past. [Walter falls back, and stands
            speechless.] O, dear Mr. Walton! don't look so pale about it: do you think
            Miss Catharine would think of such a thing as he! Lor', sir, he is beneath my contempt, let alone such a lady as Miss Clairvoir's.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. But Catharine never told me!</p>
         
         <p>Lett. No indeed; she is not one of those ladies that love to have gentlemen fight
            about them. Had you heard what she said to Mr. Dulruse, at this interview, like a
            high-spirited lady as she is, you would not feel concern on that score.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. True, true, indeed: I don't know how I could be so weak, as to think for a
            moment--
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. Lord, sir, there he is! [While Walton and Letty have been talking, two or
            three persons hart crossed the scene, and, at last, Mr. Dulruse. He looks at the party suspiciously, and passes on, just us Letty notices him.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Wall. Where? who? Ah! [About to spring after Dulruse. Letty stops him.]</p>
         
         <p>Lett. For God's sake, Mr. Walton! Think of Miss Catharine-- and for such a
            man!
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. You are right; let him go. You are a good and sensible girl, Letty. What
            next?
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. O sir, don't flatter me, or I shall begin to think all men alike. Mr.
            Dulruse has been complimenting me at a prodigious rate, I can tell you, sir,--and I
            mean to tell somebody else too.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. What! a general lover? But that is none of my business.</p>
         
         <p>Lett. No, sir? I should have thought it was. But you and Miss Catharine have such
            high notions of delicacy, you never will listen to other people's secrets.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. Nor should you either, Letty. But you are a good girl, [Offers her money.] A
            shawl, or ring or two.
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. No, sir; thank you; I have my pride, as well as my betters.
            Wait till your wedding day. Come, you are going to flatter me again, Mr. Walton:
            don't turn my head. Well, sir, to finish my story, and quickly; for people are beginning to look at us:-When Mr. Dulruse had done with the mistress he comes to
            make love to the maid, though I believe he was in search of his mother. I gave
            him his dismissal as quickly as Miss Catharine had done, (you need not smile--I did,
            sir;) and then, without saying a word to anybody, I put on my things and ran all the way to Miss Catharine's uncle's; for I knew if anybody could help
            her, it was Mr. Racy; and I think it high time he should interfere. Speak of the
            --old boy--I do declare here he is.
         </p>
         
         <p>Enter Racy.</p>
         
         <p>Racy. Eh, what the devil, Schuyler! Making love to my little Letty? Too bad that!
            Hark you, child; don't you let him teach you nonsense.'
         </p>
         
         <p>Lett. Not such a child as you take me for, Mr. Racy; and if I were, I should not
            go to an old widower for instruction. [Curtsies coquettishly.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Racy. You imp! [Drives her off.)</p>
         
         <p>Lett. [Coming back.) Oh, Mr. Walton, please tell this old gentleman
            what I told you; but, pray, for Miss Catharine's sake, don't let him teach you
            wickedness. [Exit.]
         </p>
         
         <p>Racy. Ha, ha, ha! give an inch and they'll take a yard. O, the devil! I forgot
            we're in the street. I wonder what makes the
            girls so free with me, Schuyler; eh, my boy? From the mistress to the maid,
            they say just what they please to old Frank Racy.
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. They know his good nature, sir.</p>
         
         <p>Racy. What, what! Now that's but half what you mean; there is something more in
            the comers of your mouth. I say, Walt, do you know I was seeking you?
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. And I was in search of you, sir.</p>
         
         <p>Racy. Well, that's odd; but, I'll bet you a supper, I've the best news. Frank
            Randolph's got back from Richmond! he will be here in an hour, you dog! his damned
            Parlez-vous came on this morning with all his luggage. There's news for you,
            Long-legs. Gad! we'll have a night of it. Why, how devilish grave you look!
            What is in the wind, now?
         </p>
         
         <p>Walt. Let us move on and I'll tell you. Your niece--</p>
         
         <p>Racy. What, what! I might have look'd for some curs'd catastrophe
            when a waitingmaid was in the plot. [Puts his arm through Walton's.) Well, well, my
            niece? [Exeunt.]

               <span class="person" id="clamb">Charles Lamb</span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of all the British essayists 
               <span class="person" id="clamb">Charles Lamb</span> is the most original--if
               we may be permitted to use comparatively a purely positive term. He is the
               founder of that school in which 
               <span class="person" id="dwjerrold">Douglas Jerrold</span> and 
               <span class="person" id="cfwebb">Cornelius Webbe</span> have been the
               most successful disciples,--aped at second hand, or at twentieth hand, by the
               William Joneses of our own continent--a set of little people, who, wriggling hither and thither like the entozoa, grow fat, like them, on the
               substance of alien brains.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of all original men, too, Lamb, we think, has the fewest demerits. Of gross
               faults he has none at all. His merest extravagances have about them a symmetry
               which entitles them to critical respect. And his innumerable good qualities
               who shall attempt to depict? For the present we shall let him speak
               entirely for himself in an account of his
            </p>
            FIRST PLAY.
            
            <p>At the north end of Cross-court there stands a portal, of some architectural pretensions, though reduced to humble use, serving at present for an entrance to a printing-office. This old door-way, if you are
               young, reader, you may not know was the identical pit entrance to old
               Drury-
               <span class="person" id="dgarrick">Garrick</span>'s Drury--all of it that is left. I never pass it without
               shaking some forty years from off my shoulders, recurring to the evening when I passed through it to see my first play. The afternoon
               had been wet, and the condition of our going (the elder folks and myself) was, that the rain should cease. With what beating heart did
               I watch from the window the puddles, from the stillness of which I was taught to prognosticate the desired cessation! I seem to remember
               the last spurt, and the glee with which I ran to announce it.
            </p>
            
            <p>We went with orders, which my godfather F. had sent us. He kept the oil shop
               (now Davies's) at the comer of Featherstone buildings, in Holborn. F. was a tall grave person, lofty in speech, and had pretensions above his rank.
               He associated in those days with John Palmer, the comedian, whose gait and
               bearing be seemed to copy: if John (which is quite as likely) did not rather borrow somewhat of his manner from my godfather. He was also known to, and visited by, Sheridan. It was to his house in Holborn that
               young Brinsley brought his first wife on her elopement with him from a
               boarding-school at Bath --the beautiful Maria Linley. My parents were present (over a quadrille table) when he arrived in the evening with his
               harmonious charge. From either of these connexions it may be inferred that my godfather could command an order for the then Drury-lane theatre at pleasure--and, indeed, a pretty liberal issue of those cheap billets, in Brinsley's easy autograph, I have heard him say, was the sole remuneration which he had received for many year's nightly illumination of the
               orchestra and various avenues of that theatre--and he was content it should be so. The honor of Sheridan's familiarity--or supposed familiarity--was better to my god-father than money.
            </p>
            
            <p>F. was the most gentlemanly of oilmen; grandiloquent, yet courte
               ous. His delivery of the commonest matters of fact was Ciceronian. He had
               two Latin words almost constantly in his mouth (how odd sounds Latin from an
               oilman's lips!) which my better knowledge since has enabled me to correct. In
               strict pronunciation they should have been sounded vice versa--but in those young years they impressed me with more awe than they would now do, read
               aright from 
               <span class="person" id="seneca">Seneca</span> or 
               <span class="person" id="mtvarro">Varro</span>--in his own peculiar pronunciation,
               monosyllabically elaborated, or Anglicized, into something like verse verse. By an imposing manner, and the help of these distorted syllables, he
               climbed (but that was little) to the highest parochial honors which St. Andrew's has to bestow.
            </p>
            
            <p>He is dead--and thus much I thought due to his memory, both for my first orders (little wondrous talismen!--slight keys, and insignificant to outward sight, but opening to me more than Arabian paradises!) and
               moreover, that by his testamentary beneficence I came into possession of the only
               landed property which I could ever call my own--situate near the road-way village
               of pleasant Puckeridge, in Hertfordshire. When I journeyed down to take possession, and planted my foot on my own ground, the stately habits of the donor descended upon me, and I strode (shall I confess the
               vanity?) with larger paces over my allotment of three-quarters of an acre, with its commodious mansion in the midst, with the feeling of an English freeholder that all betwixt sky and centre was my own. The estate has passed into more prudent hands, and nothing less than an
               agrarian can restore it.
            </p>
            
            <p>In those days were pit orders. Beshrew the uncomfortable manager
               who abolished them!--with one of these we went. I remember the waiting at the
               door--not that which is left--but between that and an inner door in shelter--O when shall be such an expectant again!-with the cry of nonpareils, an indispensable play-house accompaniment in those days. As near as I can recollect, the fashionable pronunciation of the theatrical fruiteresses then was, "Chase some oranges, chase some numparels, chase a bill of the
               play--chase pro choose. But when we got in, and I beheld the green curtain that veiled a heaven to my imagination, which was soon to be
               disclosed--the breathless anticipations I endured! I had seen something like it prefixed to Troilus and Cressida, in 
               <span class="person" id="nrowe">Rowe</span>'s 
               <span class="person" id="wshakespeare">Shakespeare</span>--the tent
               scene with Diomede--and a sight of that plate can always bring back in a
               measure, the feeling of that evening.--The boxes at the time, full of well dressed women of quality, projected over the pit; and the pilasters
               reaching down were adorned with a glistering substance (I know not what) under glass (as it seemed), resembling--a homely fancy-but I judged it to be sugar-candy--yet, to my raised imagination, divested of its homelier
               qualities, it appeared a glorified candy!--The orchestra lights at length arose,
               those "fair Auroras!" Once the bell sounded. It was to ring out yet once again--and incapable of the anticipation, I reposed my shut eyes in a sort of resignation on the maternal lap. It rang the second time.
               The curtain drew up--I was not past six years old and the play was Artaxerxes!
            </p>
            
            <p>I had dabbled a little in the Universal History--the ancient part of it --and here
               was the court of Persia. It was being admitted to a sight of the past. I took no proper interest in the action going on, for I understood not its
               import--But I heard the word Darius, and I was in the midst of Daniel. All feeling
               was absorbed in vision. Gorgeous vests, gardens, palaces, princesses, passed
               before me. I knew not players. I was in Persepolis for the time, and the burning
               idol of their devotion almost converted me into a worshipper. I was awe-struck, and believed those significations to be something more than
               elemental fires. It was all enchantment and a dream. No such pleasure has since visited me but in dreams.--Harlequin's invasion followed: where, I remember, the transformation of the magistrates into reverend
               beldams seemed to me, a piece of grave historic justice, and the tailor carrying
               his own head, to be as sober a verity as the legend of St. Denys.
            </p>
            
            <p>The next play to which I was taken was the Lady of the Manor, of which, with the
               exception of some scenery, very faint traces are left in my memory. It was
               followed by a pantomime, called Lun's Ghost--a satiric touch, I apprehend, upon Rich, not long since dead-but to my apprehension (too sincere for satire), Lun
               was as remote a piece of antiquity as Lud--the father of a line of Harlequins--transmitting his dagger of lath (the wooden sceptre)
               through countless ages. I saw the primeval Motley come from his silent tomb in a
               ghastly vest of white patch-work, like the apparition of a dead rainbow. So Harlequins (thought I) look when they are dead.
            </p>
            
            <p>My third play followed in quick succession. It was the Way of the World. I think I must have sat at it as grave as a judge; for, I remember, the
               hysteric affections of good Lady Wishfort affected me
               like some solemn tragic passion. Robinson Crusoe followed; in which Crusoe,
               man Friday, and the parrot, were as good and authentic as in the story.--The
               clownery and pantaloonery of these pantomimes have clean passed out of my head. I
               believe, I no more laughed at them, than at the same age I should have been
               disposed to laugh at the grotesqne Gothic heads (seeming to me then replete with
               devout meaning), that gape, and grin, in stone around the inside of the old
               Round Church (my church) of the Templars.
            </p>
            
            <p>I saw these plays in the season 1781-2, when I was from six to seven years old.
               After the intervention of six or seven other years (for at school all play-going was inhibited) I again entered the doors of a theatre. That old
               Artaxerxes evening had never done ringing in my fancy. I expected the same feelings to come again with the same occasion. But we differ from
               ourselves less at sixty and sixteen, than the latter does from six. In that
               interval what had I not lost! At the first period I knew nothing, understood
               nothing, discriminated nothing. I felt all, loved all, wondered all-
               <div class="lg">
                  
                  <br></br>Was nourished, I could not tell how--
                  
               </div>
               I had left the temple a devotee, and was returned a rationalist. The same
               things were there materially; but the emblem, the reference, was gone!--The green
               curtain was no longer a veil, drawn between two worlds, the unfolding of which
               was to bring back past ages to present a "royal ghost,"--but a certain quantity
               of green baize, which was to separate the audience for a given time from certain of their fellowmen who were to come forward and pretend those parts.
               The lights--the orchestra lights--came up a clumsy machinery. The first ring,
               and the second ring, was now but a trick of the prompter's bell --which had been,
               like the note of a cuckoo, a phantom of a voice, no hand seen or guessed at which
               ministered to its warning. The actors were men and women painted. I thought the
               fault was in them; but it was in myself, and the alteration which those many
               centuries,--of six short twelvemonths--had wrought in men. Perhaps it was fortunate
               for me that the play of the evening was but an indifferent comedy, as it
               gave me time to crop some unreasonable expectations, which might have interfered with the genuine emotions with which I was soon after enabled to
               enter upon the first appearance to me of Mrs. Siddons in Isabella, Comparison and
               retrospection soon yielded to the present attraction of the scene; and the
               theatre became to me, upon a new stock, the most delightful of recreations.

               he may be our friend of the United States' Journal. We have heard him

            <br></br>Rashly importunate,
            
            <br></br>Gone to her death!
            
            <br></br>Take her up tenderly,
            
            <br></br>Lift her with care;--
            
            <br></br>Fashion'd so slenderly,
            
            <br></br>Young and so fair!
            
            <br></br>Look at her garments
            
            <br></br>Clinging like cerements;
            
            <br></br>Whilst the wave constantly
            
            <br></br>Drips from her clothing;
            
            <br></br>Take her up instantly,
            
            <br></br>Loving, not loathing--
            
            <br></br>Touch her not scornfully;
            
            <br></br>Think of her mournfully,
            
            <br></br>Gently and humanly;
            
            <br></br>Not of the stains of her,
            
            <br></br>All that remains of her
            
            <br></br>Now, is pure womanly.
            
            <br></br>Make no deep scrutiny
            
            <br></br>Into her mutiny
            
            <br></br>Rash and undutiful;
            
            <br></br>Past all dishonor,
            
            <br></br>Death has left on her
            
            <br></br>Only the beautiful.
            
            <br></br>Still, for all slips of hers,
            
            <br></br>One of Eve's family--
            
            <br></br>Wipe those pale lips of hers
            
            <br></br>Oozing so clammily.
            
            <br></br>Loop up her tresses
            
            <br></br>Escaped from the comb,
            
            <br></br>Her fair auburn tresses;
            
            <br></br>Whilst wonderment guesses
            
            <br></br>Where was her home?
            
            <br></br>Who was her father?
            
            <br></br>Who was her mother?
            
            <br></br>Had she a sister?
            
            <br></br>Had she a brother?
            
            <br></br>Or was there a dearer one
            
            <br></br>Still, and a nearer one
            
            <br></br>Yet, than all other?
            
            <br></br>Alas! for the rarity
            
            <br></br>Of Christian charity
            
            <br></br>Under the sun!
            
            <br></br>Oh! it was pitiful!
            
            <br></br>Near a whole city full,
            
            <br></br>Home she had none.
            
            <br></br>Sisterly, brotherly,
            
            <br></br>Fatherly, motherly,
            
            <br></br>Feelings have changed:
            
            <br></br>Love, by harsh evidence,
            
            <br></br>Thrown from its eminence;
            
            <br></br>Even God's Providence
            
            <br></br>Seeming estranged.
            
            <br></br>Where the lamps quiver
            
            <br></br>So far in the river,
            
            <br></br>With many a light
            
            <br></br>From window and casement,
            
            <br></br>From garret to basement,
            
            <br></br>She stood, with amazement,
            
            <br></br>Houseless by night.
            
            
            <br></br>The bleak wind of March
            
            <br></br>Made her tremble and shiver;
            
            <br></br>But not the dark arch,
            
            <br></br>Or the black flowing river:
            
            <br></br>Mad from life's history,
            
            <br></br>Swift to be hurl'd--
            
            <br></br>Anywhere, anywhere
            
            <br></br>Out of the world?
            
            <br></br>In she plunged boldly,
            
            <br></br>No matter how coldly
            
            <br></br>The rough river ran,--
            
            <br></br>Over the brink of it,
            
            <br></br>Picture it,--think of it,
            
            <br></br>Dissolute Man!
            
            <br></br>Lave in it, drink of it
            
            <br></br>Then, If you can!
            
            <br></br>Take her up tenderly,
            
            <br></br>Lift her with care
            
            <br></br>Fashioned so slenderly,
            
            <br></br>Young and so fair! 
            
            <br></br>Ere her limbs frigidly
            
            <br></br>Stiffen too rigidly,
            
            <br></br>Decently,--kindly,--
            
            <br></br>Smoothe, and compose them;
            
            <br></br>And her eyes close them,
            
            <br></br>Staring so blindly!
            
            <br></br>Dreadfully staring
            
            <br></br>Through muddy impurity
            
            <br></br>As when with the daring
            
            <br></br>Last look of despairing
            
            <br></br>Fixed on futurity.
            
            <br></br>Perishing gloomily,
            
            <br></br>Spurred by contumely,
            
            <br></br>Cold inhumanity,
            
            <br></br>Burning insanity,
            
            <br></br>Into her rest.--
            
            <br></br>Cross her hands humbly,
            
            <br></br>As if praying dumbly,
            
            <br></br>Over her breast!
            
            <br></br>Owning her weakness,
            
            <br></br>Her evil behaviour,
            
            <br></br>And leaving, with meekness,
            
            <br></br>Her sins to her Saviour!

            <p>THE NATIONAL GALLERY AT THE ROTUNDA.--The disparity of wealth
               between the rich and the poor, has of late years attracted the attention of
               lovers of equality. The "shallow benevolent" would remedy all the evils of life by re-modelling the whole structure of society; they seem to think,
               with Alphonso the Seventh, that it is a pity the Almighty did not consult
               them while creating the universe--they could have shown Him how much better its
               moral structure might have been. These gentlemen seem to think that it is in the
               power of man to remove from the earth all sickness, pain, and poverty; they forget that it is declared by the highest authority, that we "shall have the poor always with us;" consequently that
               there must always be poor and rich. It would be well for society if these
               well-meaning persons, instead of wasting their energies in attempting things
               impossible, could be induced to confine their efforts to practical ameliorations.
               A little examination of the subject would soon convince them, that however
               great the difference between the pleasures of the rich and the pleasures of the poor, the difference is capable of being brought down by education to very narrow limits; it would be found, that the enjoyments
               belonging to
               the wealthy are confined to ostentatious display, and those accomplishments which require leisure for their acquirements.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Supreme Being, although He has been pleased to confer on but few the power of producing works of intellectual beauty, has yet given to almost
               all men the capacity, with a little cultivation, of appreciating and enjoying
               such works, independently of wealth or poverty. Take, for example, the pleasure to be derived from hearing fine Music. It is well known that
               in many parts of Germany--one of the poorest countries in Europe--all the people,
               whatever their stations in life, are equally capable of enjoying the compositions of Mozart and Beethoven. We have heard it related by a
               gentleman of great benevolence, taste, and talent, that in travelling once through a mountainous district of Germany, where the people were so
               poor that they had no horses, he was much surprised to hear a fine voice before
               him on the road, singing one of Mozart's compositions. On coming up with the singer he found a sturdy peasant, with a wheelbarrow, and on it a
               load of wood, enough for a horse, and in front of the wood a rude music stand,
               with a piece of music on it. This rude son of the soil was studying his part for the evening performance. He belonged to the village amateur operatic company. All those villagers who had voices, learned to sing, while many of the others played upon different instruments. One of
               the means of enjoyment which God had given them had been cultivated, and Mozart
               had lived as much for the peasants of the mountains, as for Joseph the
               Second, his patron (!), or the nobles of Vienna.
            </p>
            
            <p>Again: we see in England, among the poorest of the laborers, a
               taste for the beautiful productions of Nature: each cottager, although his food
               be but the coarsest bread and his drink the simple spring water, has his patch of
               garden, and the woodbine that clusters over his door appears as beautiful
               and smells as sweet to him, as to his wealthy employer.
            </p>
            
            <p>There is another source of enjoyment as much within the reach of all persons as those already mentioned, but not equally cultivated by the moderns: we mean the sense of the Beautiful. This sense, the most important
               aid to our intellectual enjoyment, was cultivated to the highest point by the
               Greeks and the Etruscans. The very earthenware utensils of the latter people
               are now sought after as models for the most costly porcelain, manufactured for
               the wealthy alone; yet the pleasure the Etrurian derived from contemplating the
               form of his earthenware pitcher, was no doubt greater than can ever be felt
               by the pampered possessor of its porcelain copy. All things animate or inanimate,
               have forms which may be beautiful or not beautiful, and to distinguish between
               these requires cultivation and study. What the course of study should be, is not exactly agreed upon; but the mode adopted by European
               governments for improving the taste of their manufacturers, has been, to open to
               them Public galleries, containing the choicest works of the pencil and the
               chisel. They have observed, that in France, where such galleries have been open to the people for generations, the manufactures have acquired
               an unrivalled degree of beauty, and the people a keen sense of the pleasure to be
               derived from the contemplation of works of Art. This is, however, a dollar
               and cent mode of viewing the subject: in a moral point of view, it has far
               higher claims to our attention, but we must defer enlarging upon this point until
               a future occasion.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have been led to the foregoing reflections by the recent opening
               in our Park of the City Gallery. The Pictures contained in the Rotunda were formerly, it will be remembered, in the possession of the late Lumon
               Reed, Esq. of Greenwich street. At his death they passed into the posess
               sion of his family, who wished to dispose of them to some private institution, as they would not consent that the collection should be divided. This was deemed by many gentlemen a favorable opportunity
               for founding a Public Gallery, which should become also the property of the
               public. A meeting was called at the suggestion of the Rev. Orville Dewey. It assembled at the residence of Mr. Jonathan Sturges, Mr.
               Ingham, we believe, being elected Chairman. Several proposals respecting the
               purchase were made, but the mode finally adopted was, that each gentleman present should subscribe as much as he felt inclined, and the deficiency, whatever it might be, should be made up by Dollar Subscriptions
               from the people at large. Then it was that the fine spirit of liberality
               shone out preeminent. One gentleman present, whose hand ever follows the dictates
               of his generous heart, and whose warmest wishes have ever been for the prosperity
               of the Fine Arts, put his name down at once for fifteen hundred
               or two thousand dollars; others subscribed a thousand, some eight and some five
               hundred dollars, and by this means the purchase money was raised, all but about
               one thousand dollars. But it should be clearly understood, that however
               large the amount subscribed by individuals, it only entitles them to an
               equal vote with the dollar subscriber. So that the men who subscribed their
               hundreds, placed themselves, voluntarily, and for the sake of the Art, on a level
               with the working man who had put down his name upon the dollar list. Too much praise cannot be awarded to these true fosterers of the
               beautiful art; while the many, and particularly the fashionable many, expend
               their so-called enthusiasm in wordy expletives and mawkish lamentation upon the fallen state of the Arts in this country, a few gentlemen honorably distinguished as New York merchants, step forward, and give the only substantial proof of their interest in Painters and the
               Painter's Art. Again we say, all honor to these generous men! their names should
               be placed in every artist's studio, for remembrance and eulogy; and our citizens in future times, while enjoying the delights and benefits of this
               liberal institution, should remember with gratitude those to whom they are
               indebted for its establishment.
            </p>
            
            <p>In furtherance of the objects of this public gallery--the objects being, to our
               mind, the general understanding and appreciation of fine works of Art--in order we
               say to further these desirable ends, we shall give a copious criticism on
               each picture in the gallery.

            <p>THE PAINTINGS AT THE AMERICAN ART-UNION.--The picture marked No.
               11--property of the Artist--is called the "Death Struggle." It is painted by C.
               Deas, of whom wo shall have more to say by and bye. The subject of the picture we take to be as follows: A Trapper has been found trespassing
               upon the Indian hunting ground. He is met by an Indian--a quarrel ensues, and being both mounted a desperate struggle commences. Being both bold,
               though wily and desperate men, we may suppose a long and cautious encounter to have taken place--each being aware of the other's
               prowess. At length, worn out by skirmishing, they close: wounds are
               inflicted on either side, but the Indian appears to have suffered the most. The
               issue of the conflict seems doubtful, but now a more fearful character is given
               to the contest. The horses, maddened by the wounds which had been dealt out alike to man and beast, break from the control of their riders, and
               rush headlong towards a frightful precipice. The Trapper and the Indian seem to
               cling closer, each anxious so become the victor, though conscious that
               certain impending death will speedily conquer both. On, on, speed the
               horses; wilder and wilder they grow in their flight
               --the height is gained--without let or pause over they go! Man and beast food for the Buzzards! But no! their downward progress is arrested by a
               boldly jutting rock. It is in this position that the artist has chosen to present
               them to the public.
            </p>
            
            <p>On the right hand of the spectator, a bold mass of rocks jut out from the main
               body, some two or three yards below the brink. On these rocks the horses and
               their riders have fallen. The situation of the Indian is by far the most precarious, his horse being upon the outer edge of the rocks, from which it is evident that its violent struggles will speedily
               dislodge it. The Indian has clasped the body of the Trapper, who holds on with
               his right hand, in which is his knife, to the limb of a huge tree, which stands
               boldly out on the extreme point of the land. A beaver, which had been
               hastily secured by the Trapper, and which was most probably the cause of the dispute, has fixed itself upon the naked arm of the Indian, which it lacerates most terribly. On the ground above, an Indian warrior is
               watching the combat with the most fearful interest depicted upon his
               face.
            </p>
            
            <p>It will be seen from this description, that the subject is treated with great
               boldness--that there is actual life in every portion of the picture. The figures
               of the Trapper and the Indian are drawn with masterly force, and the distinctive
               characteristics of the opponents preserved with admirable fidelity; more particularly the features of the two races-for while the face of the Indian
               exhibits no other expression than that of tiger-like ferocity, in the face of the bold Trapper may be discovered, mixed with unmistakeable evidences
               of indomitable firmness, an expression of horror at his appalling situation. The action of these figures is really admirable. Every portion of the picture gives evidence of rapid
               improvement in the artist's conception and execution; and in no part is the
               improvement more visible than in the drawing and coloring of the horses. In his
               previous efforts the form was certainly there, but it was wooden, texture
               and all. But in this picture the anatomy is well made out, and the animals
               have flesh upon their bones, which seems to quiver as in agony and terror. The
               right eye of the Indian warrior, watching above, is badly drawn; it is what may
               be technically called, looking down the cheek; which, from his position,
               could not be.
            </p>
            
            <p>In whatever point we examine this picture--in color, execution, or a
               composition--we are compelled to acknowledge the high talents of the Artist. He
               has grasped the subject with the hand of a master. There is a bold, daring energy
               in the design, which gives unquestionable evidence of originality--a qualification but rarely to be met with among the artists of the
               present day; and he has worked out his design with an intensity of purpose, which
               proves that he has the true artistic feeling for his profession. There is,
               however, even now, too much carelessness in his execution. In the picture
               under notice, the masses of foliage in the hack ground seem to have been daubed
               on with the finger, and rubbed off with the coat sleeve.

            <p>Mr. Deas is quite a young man; he has a long life before him; his prospects
               are most auspicious; and if he be true to himself and to his Art, he will
               acquire a wide-spread, honorable, and lasting reputation.

            <p>CHRIST HEALING THE SICK.--The good and the wise have appreciated, and in the way
               of patronage, have certainly done justice to this great and moral composition. It
               was in a philosophical and moral point of view that West ever considered the department of art which he had embraced as a
               profession, and in this sense he always wished to employ it. This fact is nobly evinced in his leaving behind him so imperishable a record of gospel dispensation as "Christ Healing the Sick"--a painting having
               for its basis the 14th and 15th verses of the 21st chapter of 
               <span class="person" id="matthew">Mathews</span>, and
               depicting in the most vividly truthful manner some sixty individuals who
               resorted to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, about the year of our Lord 33, and
               there received, at Christ's hands, a cure of their many different maladies.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Morris, a well-known amateur, has been exhibiting this great picture through some of the states with very gratifying success. It is his intention
               to visit New York this fall or next spring, and we have no doubt that he will
               reap a profitable harvest from his speculation upon the good taste and piety
               of our citizens.

            <p>Through the kindness of the owner, we have been admitted to a
               private view of one of the most exquisite pieces of sculpture that ever crossed
               the Atlantic. It is the work of the sculptor to the king of the Belgians. The
               subject is a female; the title, Coming from the Bath. As it is about to be
               exhibited, we shall defer our critical account of it. Thus much however, we will say, that in all the attributes of female loveliness, delicacy and
               roundness of form, perfection of proportion, intellectuality, gentleness, and
               modesty, it could hardly be excelled.

            <p>We are happy to say that this exquisite work of art is in the possession of an
               American gentleman, who saw it in Belgium, and being struck by its extraordinary merit, purchased it at a great price. We shall have more to say
               about it shortly.

         <p>The Bell Ringers at Palmo's.--This very clever company of wandering minstrels have been giving several concerts during the past and
            present week at the Tabernacle, and also at Palmo's Theatre. Since they last played
            here, they have travelled almost the entire length and breadth of this vast
            continent. They have also been to Havanna, Cuba, &amp;c., &amp;c. Their success has
            been everywhere most signal; indeed it could scarcely be otherwise, for their entertainments are so excellent in their way, and of so popular a character, that they are calculated to please every description of
            audience. They have much improved since we last heard them--they have acquired
            a greater degree of dexterity, and they produce more striking effects. One of their most effective pieces is undoubtedly the Blue Bells of Scotland, with
            variations. The variations consist of passages of great brilliancy and difficulty, which are executed with a precision altogether remarkable.
         </p>
         
         <p>They were encored in several of their performances, and complied with the wish of
            the people who wanted to hear the same pieces, by playing entirely different pieces
            at each encore. A more absurd custom could not possibly exist. For what do
            people encore a song, if not for the desire to
            hear it again? and if such is their wish, why do not public performers
            condescend to gratify them? The custom should be at once abolished.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mrs. Timm sang two songs during the evening, but she seemed nervous, and did not
            acquit herself as well as we have heard her.
         </p>
         
         <p>Master Sconcia played two solos on the violin. He is a very clever lad, and displays much aptitude for the instrument, but he is on the wrong
            track. Why does he expose himself to such absurd comparison, by striving to play compositions which Vieuxtemps and Ole Bul have made entirely their own. They are utterly beyond his power, and all that he can
            hope to accomplish at present, is to render them with as little caricature as possible. We speak more harshly than we wish, but we do it in all
            kindness. We are sure that with proper care, Master Sconcia would grow up to be
            a fine violinist, but if he pursues his present course, his claim to public
            approbation will cease with his round jackets.

            <p>We continue our extracts from Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="jemurdoch">Murdoch</span>'s very interesting
               MS--"The Stage."
            </p>
            
            <p>AMERICAN DRAMATIC WRITING.--To keep alive a pure and elevated taste for the
               drama, it is important not only that we cherish the high classic excellence of
               Shakspeare and the writers of former times, but that we mould into dramatic
               form the materials of our own national history, and even those of
               contemporary life. The stage connot fulfill its whole office, if it does not
               present, in due proportion, the features of character as they exist, the story of man as he is, the phases of American life.
            </p>
            
            <p>ITS MATERIALS.--And what a world of fit material our eventful history affords,
               downward from the era of the Indian, the cavalier, the puritan, the Swede, the
               Hollander, each so graphically marked in character, action, and costume, aided
               by wild scenery, startling event, and stirring incident--whether
               for the lofty style of the tragic pen, or the broad pencil of grotesque
               humor!
            </p>
            
            <p>Who yet has brought out, in the serious drama, the "play," properly
               so-called--the rich materials furnished by such sources, and by the still nearer
               men and times of the Indian and French wars, and even the period of the Revolution? Have not our young writers been too prone to cast their
               efforts into the mould of the classic tragedy, while they overlooked the nearer
               access to 'men's business and bosoms,' opened by dramatic character and incident?
               There lies yet unexplored the whole mine of western life and character, so
               graphic in itself, so rich in situation and incident; the Roman grandeur of
               the life of our southern plantations, the quiet home scenes of rural and village
               life in the nooks and valleys of New England, so exuberant in quaint and
               picturesque peculiarity, in sly humor and local manners--yes, and so
               abundant, too, in instances of the loftiest heroism of romance, befitting
               the majestic features of her mountain scenery, and the sternness of her
               climate.
            </p>
            
            <p>ITS CHARACTER.--It is the genius of her young writers that our country must look
               for a regenerated drama, breathing the spirit of freedom and of high-toned
               manhood, of pure and noble sentiment and generous feeling--an ideal of human
               life, such as may draw from every American heart the response which we give when we enter the studio of the painter, who has just
               finished a faithful and speaking portraiture of our intimate friend. Yes, these
               are the very features: it
               is a perfect likeness. Let us have a drama of which we can say, 'Yes, this
               is our mode of life and character: this is true, this is real.' Not that it is
               prosaic and literal, but true-- true to the idea, true to the sentiment--a free not
               a close copy, but a genuine study of nature.
            </p>
            
            <p>ITS SENTIMENT.--I would by no means be understood, however, as disposed to limit American dramatic writers so rigorously, to
               national themes, as to exclude all others. No: an important end of a national
               drama would be that of imbuing the mind of our people with appropriate national
               feeling, in regard to the forms of life and character in other countries.
               The direct and impartial vision which every American ought to turn upon the
               doings of men in other lands, should find fitting reflection in the language of
               our dramatic writers. The sentiments of the American, as he contemplates the
               usurpations perpetrated by custom, and the paraphernalia of ceremony, should
               breathe in their expression his native air of freedom and disdain. The mirror
               which he holds up to nature should be pure from every stain of conventional and
               'bated breath.' Do I assert too much in saying that the American drama ought to be the treasury of free, noble sentiment and glowing
               expression, for whatever concerns the moral and political life of man?
            </p>
            
            <p>MATERIALS OF AMERICAN TRAGEDY.--It has been objected, by some writers on
               dramatic composition, that modern life, in no nation, furnishes the appropriate
               themes of the higher or tragic drama, and that a country so young as ours,
               cannot offer, in its whole territory, the requisite data. But this
               question has, I think, been settled by the perfect success of English
               authors, who have written on subjects drawn from no remoter era than that of the colonization of our own country. The men of the English
               commonwealth, and of the times immediately preceding and subsequent, furnish in
               the vigorous, stern, and lofty stamp of character, of one party, the
               philosopic and intellectual elevation of another, and the very recklessness and
               unbridled license of a third, the most abundant and the most effective materials of mental and moral delineation. They leave nothing wanting for the purposes of graphic effect, rich character, bold
               relief, and vivid coloring. The whole of that portion of English and American history, is thoroughly dramatic. The mere silent perusal of it by the solitary student, converts the imagination into
               a theatre, where the monarch and the meanest of his rebellious republican subjects, the courtier and the humble citizen,
               the devotee and the man of the world, the fanatic and the hypocrite, the hero
               and the saint, the cavalier and the puritan, the cultivated European, and the savage of the American forest, all meet to fret their hour upon
               the busiest stage that the history of the world has recorded.
            </p>
            
            <p>Regard, too, the "pith and moment" of the great enterprise then first agitating the modem world--the great question of political liberty, in which all the actors just enumerated were more or less
               involved, and there is stamped on that era an impress of interest as broad and deep as humanity itself. It is a period which sheds its influence on every subsequent stage of man's history.
            </p>
            
            <p>AMERICAN MATERIALS FOR "MIXED" PLAYS.--But grant, for the moment, that the
               sources whence we might derive a national drama, are comparatively limited, in
               the deparment of purely tragic composition,--there still remains that peculiar form of dramatic writing, for which the genius of the
               Anglo-Saxon race has so marked a predilection, and in which, hitherto, it
               has so preeminently excelled,--I allude to the serious and serio-comic play, the
               sphere in which 
               <span class="person" id="wshakespeare">Shakspeare</span> loved to move.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>Our early history is peculiarly rich in the materials for the construction of
               this species of the drama. The varieties of national and individual character are, in this period, numerous and distinctly marked, to a degree
               unparalleled in other times, and in other regions of the world: nor is there
               any lack of event, or incident, or striking situation, or of field for the
               display of character and sentiment.
            </p>
            
            <p>The remark applies equally to our own times. The last ten years afford, on our
               own continent, ample materials of every description for the composition of
               historical plays of a character which, were our authors awake to the value of
               the subject, might live to distant times.
            </p>
            
            <p>The mixed play, in which the serious "business of life predominates, but does not exclude the free working of humor and individuality
               in character and domestic incident, is the staple of the stage. The purely
               tragic and the merely comic are the extremes of life, and cannot sustain their
               interest, in dramatic representation, with that firmness and that uniformity which belong to the other. It is in this department of
               the drama, that, as a nation, we are most deficient; and it is to this that our young authors should turn their attention, as at once an inviting
               and a sure field of action,--for the writer, whether we regard his personal success, or the effective aid he would render to the stage, by
               attracting to it the natural, patriotic feeling of the people.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of the regular tragedy we have a large supply already furnished by the classic writers of England. Of broad comic delineation there will always
               be furnished enough to meet the transient demand for it. Of light and polished
               comedy, touched by the pen of classical elegance, England itself now
               affords no specimen. The reserve of sentiment, the smooth uniformity of
               character, and the tame monotony of life, which our day exhibits, leaves no
               point of effect, no striking light, no contrast in color for the pencil of the
               dramatist.
            </p>
            
            <p>This poverty of production in classic comedy, we share in common with the mother country; and above this disadvantage we cannot rise. The
               evil is inwrought with the very texture of contemporary life. But in the department of historic and domestic plays we are rich in
               resources. Let our writers but develope them.
            </p>
            
            <p>AMERICAN MELO-DRAME.--Nor need American authors neglect that wide
               field of dramatic display which lies in the humbler sphere of spectacle, where
               scenery and costume and array, aided by music, effect so much to excite the
               feelings of wonder and delight in the juvenile spectator, and those whose
               confined mode of daily life allows so little scope for observation and variety,
               and whose faculties are necessarily athirst for action through the eye.
            </p>
            
            <p>HISTORIC MELO-DRAME.--The whole ancient world of history lies open
               for such purposes to the dramatic writer; and the displays of Egyptian worship, and Grecian art, and Roman triumphs, and chivalric pomp, may all be converted into practical lessons in history, imparted through
               the senses, and imprinted indelibly on the memory. The scenes of Mexican splendor on our own continent, might form an appropriate sphere for similar effects.
            </p>
            
            <p>DOMESTIC PIECES.--Let dramatic composition assume forms of truth and dignity,
               of utility and moral effect,--let them, even in their gayest displays,
               contribute something to the aliment of the mind; and one source of objectien to the drama will be entirely removed. We have a convincing proof
               of the truth of this assertion, in the unprecedented success of Popular
               domestic piece, entitled The Drunkard, or the Fallen Saved, as performed at the
               Boston Museum. This play, acted upwards of a hundred times, continues to
               draw
               overflowing houses in consequence of the structure of the piece. It turns
               on scenes, and incidents, and characters, which appeal, incessantly, to the actual feelings and knowledge of the audience. It proves, more
               impressively than ever, that the drama has its foundation in the human heart,
               and cannot be eradicated from it; that the best way of reforming the theatre, is to let it take its natural way to the feelings of the people, through the medium of true delineations of life, which
               are always full of moral instruction. The crowded audiences which this piece
               attracts from all ranks and conditions of life, the sanction which its
               excellent effect, in a moral point of view, has drawn from the most influential minds, including those within the circle of the clerical
               profession itself,--all serve to show what dramatic writing may effect,
               when turned into the channels which we have suggested.
            </p>
            
            <p>I can imagine no way in which a mind of noble qualities can impart more immediate, more extensive, or more permanent benefit to a
               community like ours, than by fusing its best conceptions into the mould of the drama, and thus rendering them at once universally accessible, and
               universally influential and effective.

            <div class="biblPage">157</div>
            <p>PARK THEATRE.--On Tuesday evening Mr. &amp; Mrs. Chas. Kean appeared in
               
               <span class="person" id="wshakespeare">Shakspeare</span>'s comedy of "Much Ado about Nothing." Mrs. Kean's exquisite
               performance of Beatrice is too well known in this city to require any comment.
               On this occasion her acting charmed us as much as ever, and left us in full possession of the opinion we have long entertained, that she need fear no rival in this and most other characters in legitimate comedy. The great novelty of the evening was the first
               appearance--in this country at least--of Mr. C. Kean in comedy; and we certainly
               felt much curiosity to see whether, like his great predecessor Garrick, he
               could be claimed by either of the antagonistic Muses as her legitimate
               offspring; and the result has brought us to the conclusion, that tragedy
               is decidedly his forte; and that however well he may conceive and execute such
               characters as Benedick, Don Felix, and many others, he has one natural defect sufficient to mar, in a great measure, the effect of his performance of them. We allude, of course, to his voice. Where there
               is a want of euphony in this organ, it is sure to be more conspicuous, more
               noticeable, in dialogue of a colloquial nature, than it would be in the
               declamation of tragedy; and the reason is obvious. In the various passions
               pourtrayed in tragedy, there are so many transitions and modulations of
               the voice--(anger, terror, despair, love and melancholy, each producing an
               almost total change)--that let the imperfection be ever so great, we lose sight
               of it in the interest of the scene, and in our admiration of the author's
               delineation. The quality of the voice is, indeed, a secondary consideration, and never detracts from our admiration of the genius of a great actor. We need only instance the cases of John Kemble and the elder Kean, the former particularly, whose defect in this
               respect was so great, that it gave one the idea, when hearing him, of a man
               afflicted with the asthma; and yet he was perhaps, the most noble tragedian
               England ever produced.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have made these observations, not in any ill will towards Mr. Kean; quite the contrary. His conception of Benedick was that of
               an accomplished artist; ho sustained the spirit, wit, and raciness of the character admirably throughout; and not a point was lost in his
               hands. He certainly possesses a true comic vein, and must always please a discriminating audience.
            </p>
            
            <p>We must not conclude our notice without mentioning Mr. 
               Bland, a gentleman engaged by Mr. Simpson as one of his stock company. Mr.
               Bland enacted the part of Don Pedro (the Prince)--by no means a difficult part,
               by the bye--but he shewed, at once, that he was an actor much above the ordinary standard of those who do not come over here as stars. He delivered the poetry with excellent emphasis and discretion, and
               his action is easy, graceful, and gentlemanly. If we are not much mistaken, he
               is capable of shining in a higher walk; but he must abide his time, we suppose. We understand he has since admirably played the Banished
               Duke in "As you Like it;" so that he evidently possesses versatility. We congratulate the manager and the public on his engagement.
            </p>
            
            <p>The only other cast in the play worth mentioning was the Dogberry of Mr. Bass.
               He played it with much humor, and elicited the hearty laughter of the audience.
               After listening to him some few minutes, we thought he was somewhat like
               the late John Reeve; and before he had finished, we set him down as one
               of the best imitators of that droll original we had ever seen.
            </p>
            
            <p>The comedy was, altogether, well put upon the stage. There was a due attention
               to costume, scenery, &amp;c. for which the management deserve much credit.

               the suppression of his cry, or a mother searching through St. Giles's for her
               lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg's golden childhood-- there was hardly a verse in
               which some touches of heart, or some play of fancy, did not beckon the laughing

               tear which must flow on such pathetic narratives as Eugene Aram or the Old Elm
               Tree. Without a parallel and original as 
               <span class="person" id="thood">Hood</span> was in the ludicrous, his more
               enduring fame will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassionate."--Literary Gazette.

            <p>MR. J. F. BROWNE, SIR:--Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making
               a
               professional use of your Harps, and of testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship,
               and above all, a solidity that stands proof against the inconstancy of our trying climate,
               they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction. I am yours, CHARLES
               THIBAULT, January, 1845. No. 40 Beach Street, N. Y.
            </p> 
            
            <p>DEAR SIR:--I write to exrress the delight I experienced in performing on one of your
               Harps at Sig. Casella's
               Concert in this city. The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly
               superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old Master,
               Bochsa, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no
               other. Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST. Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Mr. J. F. BROWNE, SIR:--I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make
               I
               performed on at the St. George's Society Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone,
               touch and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to
               all
               your Harps. The Grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid
               instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN. New York, January 16th, 1845.
               A pupil of N. C. Bochsa.
            </p>
            
            <p>MR. J. F. BROWNE, SIR:--Having at your request closely
               scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best qualities of the
               first Makers in Europe combined. That the ease of touch, by which the most
               brilliant tone is obtained, the perfection and ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the
               most refined taste. Your new Grand Gothic six and a half octavo,is the most
               splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great
               pleasure in recommending your Harps at every opportunity. Yours Truly, HENRY
               HORN. January 12th, 1854. An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.

               Young Ladies, from 7 to 10 years of age, among whom are three of his own

            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Derwort's system is the result of many years' observation and
               experience, during which he has successfully taught in Germany, London, and New York. His method cannot fail to impart to his pupils a
               clear perception, and a thorough knowledge of the grammatical principles of
               music, with the ability to harmonize any simple given melody.

            <p>"With the Florentine Histories, I am well acquainted. Formed on
               the classical models of antiquity, it is executed with consummate skill, few
               historital compositions are so successful in attaining the two great ends of
               entertainment and instruction. The style is spirited, clear and vigorous, the
               narrative rapid and condensed, the reflections of the author, though brief and
               sententious, are always appropriate and often profound.
            </p> 
            
            <p>There is probably no work within the same compass in which the instructive lessons of History can be studied with more profit and effect."</p>

               friends and to the public, would, at me same time call attention to their Stock
               of Instruments, of six and seven octaves, just finished, in elegant Rosewood and
               mahogany cases.

            <p>The subscribers, from their long experience in every department
               of the business, have been enabled to add several important improvements to
               the action, so that their Instruments, they feel assured will prove, upon
               examination, equal to any in the market.
