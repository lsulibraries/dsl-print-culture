         <p>WE conclude our remarks on the exhibition in the present number.</p>
         
         <p>No. 38. David and the Fair Shunamite, (called in the Catalogue Shumanite.) W. Winner. This is the work of a Philadelphia artist, and being a stranger in our
            exhibition, we feel kindly disposed towards him, but not to that excessive degree that will blind us to the defects of
            his little picture. The artist has entirely misconstrued his
            text, which is one of the finest in the Scriptures for pictorial illustration. The passage is quoted from "Kings i. 8, 4, but it will be
            found in the first three verses of the first chapter of the first book of
            Kings.
         </p>
         
         <p>Now king David was old and well stricken in years, and they covered
            him with clothes, but he got no heat. Wherefore his servants said unto him: Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her
            stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that
            my
            lord the king may get heat. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the
            coasts of Israel and found Abishag, a Shunamite, and brought her to the king. And
            the damsel was very fair and cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the
            king knew her not."
         </p>
         
         <p>The artist has allowed the whole beauty of the passage to escape him. He has
            placed David in his royal robes on the top of a high throne and the fair Shunamite
            at his feet too far removed to impart any heat to the old monarch though she
            were as hot as a furnace. There is hardly more nature in this picture than in the
            decorations of a China tea cup. It is idealized to the extremest point of
            inanity.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 296--Jael and Sisera. P. P. Duggan. A slightly tinted outline drawing, manifesting a thorough understanding of the text, a fine imagination, great anatomical knowledge, and a firm hand. It is a very chaste design, and argues well for the future prospects of this talented young artist. No. 369, a model in clay, called an Antediluvian, by the
            same hand, is a disagreeable subject, but it proves the artist to be a hard
            student, and a very skilful modeler. As a mere display of anatomical knowledge it has many technical merits, but it is disgusting to see so much ability
            thrown away upon a subject that can give no pleasure. The artist should always
            strive to hide his technical knowledge instead of making an obvious parade of
            it.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 302--Boaz and Ruth. A. G. Miller. A glaringly bad composition.</p> 
         
         
         <p>No. 108--Saint John. Thos. Hicks, A. This painting has been the subject of many
            ungenerous remarks, more to the discredit of those who uttered them than to the
            modest artist whose work they were intended to dispraise, for it possesses
            merits of a very high order. It is a disagreeable subject, but it is a
            truthful portrait, and strictly considered, is really more imaginative than the Saint John of Murillo, for it approaches more nearly to nature, not in
            color and drawing, but in design. A desert is not the place where we have a right
            to look for well rounded limbs and a full paunch, but then leanness is
            unpleasant to look upon, and we will forgive the solecism of fatness in the young
            saint, for the pleasure of looking upon a handsome boy with a rosy face and shining
            locks. The truth is the subject is one that cannot be fitly represented, and
            Mr. Hicks has done himself an injury by making the attempt. Since people do not go
            naked in this age of the world, they cannot serve as naked models; their flesh
            is delicate and soft, and must always look unpleasant when imitated in the
            representation of a naked person whose body has been tempered by exposure to the
            sun and the rain. For similar reasons, we can produce no fine statues in this
            age, for it is impossible to find fine models. The body is spoiled by its
            clothes. Artists should be content, therefore, to paint hands and faces. The days
            of Apollos and Dianas are past; they may return by and by when the world becomes wiser, but until they do it will be idle to look for them in
            art.
         </p>     
         
         <p>The figure of Saint John is well drawn and well colored; his position is easy and becoming, and the surrounding landscape is a fine idea of the desert, which is considerably hightened by a Cactus growing in the foreground.
            It is plain that Mr. Hicks has higher aims than to catch the eye of vulgar gazers, and the absence of everything like trickery from his pictures, shows him to be an honest and truthloving artist. He is soon to leave this country for Germany and Italy where he will spend two or
            three years, and we have no fears that he will be spoilt by attempting to copy the
            great things that others have done instead of adopting the means by which they
            accomplished their greatness.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 211--Rachel envied her Sister. J. G. Chapman, N. A. The passage referred to in
            the catalogue as the subject of this picture, is "Gen. XXX: 3. But this must be
            another misquotation, for the verse contains nothing that can be considered applicable to the picture. As a picture of Rachel, we can
            discover no merit in this performance, but considered merely as the portrait of a
            young woman seated upon a stone,--it has many good points, and we regard it as the
            best picture that Mr. Chapman has ever painted.
         </p>
         
         <p>These six works comprise all the scripture subjects, excepting the
            "Death of Abel" and "Elijah," which have been noticed before; but these are enough. We are too thoroughly acquainted with the Bible in these Sunday School
            days to tolerate scripture pieces in art, excepting from men of the highest
            genius and most extensive knowledge.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 45--Cupid and Psyche.J. Freeman, N. A. The 
            fleshy parts of Psyche are sweetly painted, but the drapery is wretched
            to the last degree. Cupid has a pretty boyish face, but his back is dreadfully
            misdrawn, and badly colored. It is a meaningless picture. If it were intended for
            an illustration of the Greek legend of Cupid and Psyche, there is no propriety
            in the figures. Psyche is too old and Cupid too young. No. 64--Italian beggar
            children, by the same artist, has been more admired than any other picture in the
            gallery, and it is deserving of a good deal of praise; but it is only good in parts. The boy has a face that never belonged to a beggar, nor to any
            other creature who had known exposure, or suffering from want. The position in
            which he stands is constrained and painful, and his body is exposed on purpose, not by accident, nor for effect to gain sympathy, hut
            as a study for the artist. The drapery is nothing but paint. The face is a sweet
            face per se, and the body is very finely painted, but as a beggar boy, the figure
            is incongruous and out of character. The sleeping girl is well put in as a
            subordinate in the composition, but taken altogether, the picture
            is very far from being a complete one, or a pleasing composition. There is no
            sentiment of indigence in it; one might look at it forever without putting his hand
            in his j pocket to feel for money. It is a study, and as a study has much
            merit.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 331--Crucifixion of our Savior. W. G. Williams, H. We marvel at the temerity of
            the artist in attempting a subject which none but the most sublime genius should
            dare to touch; and we marvel still more at the admission of such a picture by
            the committee of arrangements. They have hung it as nearly out of sight as they
            could, but no work should be admitted in an exhibition like this which is not
            worthy to be well hung.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 73--The News-boy's lament. T. Le Clear. A very good head, full of natural expression, and evidently a portrait. But the title is a misnomer;
            there is no lamentation, nor any cause for it discoverable in the picture.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 92--Olivia and Sophia consulting the fortune teller, from the Vicar of
            Wakefield. A. G. Miller. There are two very good reasons why this subject should not be attempted by an American Artist; first, it has been painted a
            million of times; second, it is an English subject which an American cannot
            paint. Mr. Miller's name is new to us, and if he is a very young artist his picture
            shows evidence of talent that may produce something better hereafter.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 102--Head of a Fox Hound. W. J. Bolton. This and the head of a greyhound,
            203, are the best specimens of animal portraiture that we have ever seen in our
            exhibitions. We believe that Mr. Bolton is an amateur, but his paintings would
            do honor to a professional artist.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 107--Sugaring Off. T. H. Matteson. (Purchased by the Am. Art-Union). Mr.
            Matteson is a young artist of very considerable ability; this, and "the Spirit of
            '76," 118, are the first of his productions that we have seen. The "sugaring
            off" is a representation of a genuine American scene, which evidently possesses
            much that is vraisemblable. The artist has shown a commendable disposition in choosing scenes for illustration with which he is familiar, but all
            the personages of his tableau do not seem in their element It is a pleasing composition, and we have no doubt of its proving a popular picture.
            The "Spirit of '76" is not much to our taste; the actors in it seem to be playing a
            game of brag. No. 162, "the lost glove," is much better in point of color than
            the other two works, but the subject itself is too trifling for an elaborate
            painting.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 110--The Evening Chat. E. White. A quiet pleasant little picture. Good in tone and quite perfect in drawing.</p>
         
         <p>No. 114--Facing the Enemy. F. W. Edmonds, N. A. A reformed toper looking resolutely
            at a bottle of rum which is rendered doubly tempting by being placed on the sill of
            an open window, the light falling through it and rendering it very brilliant
            and cheerful; but a total abstinence paper is stuck upon the wall, and the old
            toper bends back in his chair as it to get out of harm's way, and we cannot but
            feel certain that he will come off victor over his temptations, worse than St.
            Anthony's, in the end. The figure is well drawn and the story very perfectly told,
            which is a point that Mr. Edmonds rarely or never fails in. The old toper is one
            of those hard drinkers with carbuncled noses and crispy hair, who used to be
            common enough twenty years ago but are now growing very rare. A few years hence,
            and there will be no more red noses, and then a picture like this will possess the kind of interest that the figures in old illuminations
            do, preserving the peculiar barbarisms of an age that can never be repeated. When drinking shall have gone entirely out of fashion the world will
            scarcely believe that it was indulged in to the excess that books and songs and
            pictures will tell of. 227, "The New Scholar," is quite equal, we think, to
            any of Mr. Edmond's former productions. The head of the village pedant is
            excellently well painted and most happily conceived. The unwilling urchin is a
            beautiful boy and a fine sturdy little fellow, who would rather be racing
            through the fields with his dog than be shut up in school with a dull book and
            a tyrant teacher. The boy is right and everybody sympathises with him, particularly
            in this spring weather.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 126--The Parting of Edwy and Elgiva. C. Leutze, 2c, H. This is altogether the finest composition in the exhibition. It is small and unpretending, but it possesses sufficient merit to stamp the artist a master though
            he had done nothing else. The character of Edwy is most happily made out,
            while that of the stem Dunstan is given with great force. They relieve and heighten
            each other.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 130--Sketch of a design for a statue of Washington, for the city of New York. Pedestal designed by F. Catherwood. Statue by T. Crawford. Painted by Henry Hillyard. If we were not well assured that either the parsimony or the instinctive good sense of our citizens would secure us
            against such an abomination as this ever being perpetrated, we would protest
            against it with all our might. The catalogue says that the statue is to be cast
            iron, 75 feet high. But while we need cast iron for rail fences and a thousand
            other good uses, we have little apprehension that any quantity of such a precious metal will ever be wasted in making an effigy of Washington that will
            represent him in the theatrical attitude of a French Marshal, with a cloak on
            his back unlike anything that Washington ever wore.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 176. Cupid Begging for his Arrows--H. Peters Gray, N. A. Christian and Pagan
            Artists resemble each other in one thing, if no more; they believe their Gods to be
            a kind of celestial poultry men and women with wings, like hens and hawks. We
            never see the picture of the archangel Gabriel without thinking of the barn-yard.
            Mr. Gray has given his Cupid a pair of wings according to rule, but the mother
            that bore him, for we take the respectable looking matron at whose knees he is
            standing, to be intended for his mother, has no such appendages. The color of this
            picture is very fine, and Venus is a very passable woman, but a very odd
            looking goddess. The sentiment of the composition is poor, feeble, and common-place. It is neither classic nor familiar--Christian nor Pagan.
            If it were the end of art to produce such things as these, which can never touch
            the heart or inform the mind, it would be as well to have no Art; and painters
            would be better employed in covering the outsides of houses than in decorating
            their interiors.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 195. Dance of the Haymakers--W. S. Mount, N. A. What a delight to pass from a
            picture like the last to this scene of real life and jollity. The canvas is alive
            with fun and nature. The floor near it is worn, like the carpet beneath a
            lady's mirror, from the tread of constant visiters. It is enough to say of this work, that it is equal to any of the artist's former productions; higher praise could not be bestowed upon a work of Art. At the first glance, from the unpleasant monotony of its salmon-colored tints, it is very repulsive, but the moment that its forms are perceived, all
            effects of mere color are forgotten, and you step out of the exhibition room into the barn, and instead of a spectator, become an actor in the scene. There are some monstrous anachronisms in the picture, such as the pink coat of one of the dancers, and there is some very bad
            drawing, like the legs of the fiddler; and the fiddler himself is borrowed from one of Clonney's pictures, but these are mere specks, which would not
            mar the beauty of the work if they were trebled in amount. This is one of
            those works that produce that intense degree of pleasure which we call tickling.
            Although we are struck with the perfect naturalness of the scene, we are apprehensive that such exhibitions are extremely rare in any of our
            barns. No. 242, "bird egging," is quite as good in its way as the haymakers.
            The subject is simplicity itself: three children have robbed a bird's nest, the
            oldest holds it in his hands, his little sister is trying to beg it, and his
            smaller brother has his hands up to his eyes crying for it. The pic
            ture is hardly bigger than your hand, yet it contains more truth and
            feeling than all the other canvases in the room. One cannot look at it long without
            feeling a moisture in his eyes. We realize at once that one touch of Nature makes
            the whole world kin. In the next room are a father and mother standing by the
            side of their murdered son, murdered by a brother, too, but we look at them without
            the smallest emotion; but here is a little boy crying for a bird's nest, and
            we cannot help crying with him. Now if there was one touch of Nature in the
            big picture, the sight of it would throw us into an agony of grief, but there is
            not, and we look upon it without moving a muscle or winking an eye. Feeling is the test by which all works of Art must be tried.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 204. Horse and Shetland Pony--T. Hicks, A. An admirable interior, and the portraits of the animals are capitally given.</p>
         
         <p>No. 214. Popping the Question--W. F. Van Zandt. A man and a woman in very equivocal
            postures; the man seems to be doing anything but popping the question.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 240. Surrender of Guatemozin--P. F. Rothermel. Another Philadelphia picture, by
            one of the most promising artists in the mob city; but not to our view one of his
            best pictures. It is a passage taken from 
            <span class="person" id="whprescott">Prescott</span>'s Conquest of Mexico, and is, of course, purely ideal. There is an unpleasant prevalence of
            scarlet which tinges every object in the picture. There are some very pretty
            figures, but they appear like a group of fashionable ladies and gentlemen in a
            tableau vivant, rather than real personages in the drama of life.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nos. 260, 264--by C. E. Weir. Two small paintings, possessing a good
            deal of merit, but exceedingly unpleasant in color. If Mr. Weir would strive to get
            rid of the dingy hue which the greater part of his pictures have, they would show
            to much better advantage. That he can rid himself of it, is very plain from
            the fruit piece, No. 295, which is admirably colored, and finely drawn. But it is
            painful to see so much time and talent wasted in copying apples and peaches.
         </p>
         
         <p>Immortality teaching Love to Hope--has relief in marble T. G. Crawford, H.--Unworthy
            of the reputation which the artist enjoys.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 271. Saturday Afternoon--M. E. D. Brown. A dreadful affair. It is
            a scene in a French Kitchen, as we judge, from the utensils hanging up, but the
            figures are English. It is a poor thing, and the committee should have had more
            regard for the painter than to admit it.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nos. 288, 290. Pen and Ink Drawings--Samuel Wallin. Very beautiful and highly
            finished drawings. The Prosy Speaker looks like a line engraving. This is a style
            of Art that we hope to see more extensively cultivated. Mr.Wallin is an
            amateur, but he draws exceedingly well.
         </p>
         
         <p>No. 213. Dance of Demons--by F. O. C. Darley. Pen and ink drawing. This is quite
            unlike any of Mr. Darley's sketches that we had seen. It has great merit as a
            drawing; the demons are sketched with a terrible force, and the whole
            composition manifests genius of a high order.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is not one specimen of architectural drawing in the exhibition by any of our architects, which is very discreditable to somebody--either to the
            architects or the Academy. Considering the great number of new churches and other
            important buildings which have been put up during the year, and are still in
            process of erection; it is a subject of surprise that no architect should deem it
            of importance to exhibit his drawings and plans to the public, when so fine an opportunity offers as the exhibition of the National Academy. There
            are two framed architectural drawings by Mr.Catherwood, which were doubtless intended for the new houses of Parliament in London. We can divine no good reason for exhibiting them here.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are a few good miniatures in the exhibition, but none of a high order. Mr.
            Hite, Mr. M--Dougal, and Mr. Cummings have several good ones; that of Kyle, the
            flutist, by M--Dougal, is very neat and a good likeness. We have seen much
            better examples from Mrs. Bogardus and Miss Hall than those which these ladies have
            here now.
         </p>
         
         <p>Taken altogether, the exhibition gives but little hope for the cause of Art in the United States; and when we remember how wide a field is offered for
            native artists, how easily employment is obtained by even mediocre abilities, and
            what opportunities for study every young artist enjoys, we are compelled to the conclusion that there is an incubus weighing upon Art, which, if not removed, will destroy her altogether; and this incubus we believe in our heart is the Academy that was instituted for her nourishment. We have
            not room at present to give our reasons for this belief--neither are we very certain of being right in our conclusions; but we think that a
            glance at the walls of the exhibition, by any unprejudiced observer, would lead him to the same belief. Everybody will acknowledge that the very worst performances in the exhibition are by academicians, and that the best
            things in it are by men who have not yet had the distinction of "associate" conferred upon them. If the interests of art in the city are placed in the hands
            of such men, what can be hoped for Art? Nothing, unless the artists who are the
            sufferers by this state of things, take the business in hand themselves and form a
            new Academy, as the artists did when they found that the old American Academy was destroying them by its accumulation of stupidity and arrogance. A
            rival institution would be of benefit in every respect, and we hope sincerely that
            one may be formed. There should be two exhibitions at least in the year, and a
            wholesome spirit of rivalry might be created, which would have the happiest
            effect on the interests of Art. There is talent enough, and patronage enough to warrant it, and we hope it may be undertaken.

         <p>I was sick--sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound
            me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me. The
            sentence--the dread sentence of death--was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the
            inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution-perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel. This only for a brief period; for
            presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an
            exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. They appeared to me
            white--whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words--and thin even to
            grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness--of immoveable resolution--of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the
            syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a
            few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And
            then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore
            the aspect of charity, and seemed white slender angels who would save me; but
            then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every
            fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame,
            and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there stole into my
            fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in
            the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at
            length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if
            magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames
            went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades.
            Then silence, and stillness, and night were the universe.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was
            lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt
            to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest
            slumber--no! In delirium--no! In a swoon--no! In death--no! even in the grave all is
            not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most profound
            of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second
            afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed.
            In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the
            sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical,
            existence. It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could
            recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in
            memories of the gulf beyond. And that gulf is--what? How at least shall we
            distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I
            have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval,
            do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has
            swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals
            that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many
            may not view; is not he who ponders ever the perfume of some novel flower--is
            not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which
            has never before arrested his attention.
         </p>
         
         <p>Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember;
            amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state
            of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there
            have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there
            have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up
            remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures
            me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down
            --down--still down--till a hideous dizziness oppressed me
            at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent.
            They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of
            that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore
            me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits
            of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their
            toil. After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and
            then all is madness--the madness of a memory which busies
            itself among forbidden things.
         </p>
         
         <p>Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound--the tumultuous motion of
            the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating, Then a pause in which all is
            blank. Then again sound, and motion, and touch--a tingling sensation pervading
            my frame. Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought--a condition
            which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and
            earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful
            effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable
            draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire
            forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much
            earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.
         </p>
         
         <p>So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.
            There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where
            and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded
            the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look upon things
            horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see. At length,
            with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness of eternal night
            encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to
            oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the
            inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real
            condition. The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval
            of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually
            dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether
            inconsistent with real existence; --but where and in what state was I? The
            condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the auto-da-fes, and one of
            these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded
            to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many
            months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo,
            had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.
         </p>
         
         <p>A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon
            recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre. I
            thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I
            felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of
            a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my
            forehead. The agony of suspense, grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes
            straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light. I
            proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more
            freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of
            fates.
         </p>
         
         <p>And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon
            my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons
            there had been strange things narrated--fables I had always deemed them--but yet
            strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of
            starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more
            fearful, awaited me? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to
            doubt. The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.
         </p>
         
         <p>My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry-very smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up;
            stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its
            circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the knife
            which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper
            of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the
            masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless,
            was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first
            insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragmental full
            length, and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison,
            I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the 
            circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent
            of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I
            staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I
            lay.
         </p>
         
         <p>Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this
            circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour
            around the prison, and with much toil, came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight
            more;--when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty
            yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall, and thus I
            could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I could not help supposing
            it to be.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had little object--certainly no hope--in these researches; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross
            the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme caution, for the
            floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At
            length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly;
            endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had advanced some ten or
            twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on
            my face.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a somewhat
            startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this--my chin rested upon
            the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head,
            although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At the same
            time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed
            fungus arose to my nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that
            I had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just
            below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and
            let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as
            it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; a: length there was a
            sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment there
            came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a door overhead,
            while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly
            faded away.
         </p>
         
         <p>I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated myself
            upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step before my fall, and
            the world had seen me no more. And the death just avoided, was of that very
            character which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its tyranny, there was the choice
            of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral
            horrors. I had been reserved for the latter. By long suffer ing my nerves had
            been unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in
            every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.
         </p>
         
         <p>Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving there to perish
            rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon. In other conditions of
            mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of
            these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what I
            had read of these pits--that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of
            their most horrible plan.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again
            slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of
            water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It
            must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly
            drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me--a sleep like that of death. How long it lasted of
            course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects
            around me were visible. By a wild sulphurous lus- tre, the origin
            of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect
            of the prison.
         </p>
         
         <p>In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its
            walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me a
            world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less importance, under the
            terrible circumstances which environed me, than the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied
            myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement. The
            truth at length flashed upon me. In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell; I must
            then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I
            must have returned upon my steps--thus supposing the circuit nearly double what
            it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my
            tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.
            In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great
            irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from
            lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison
            was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other
            metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the
            hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition
            of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with
            skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred,
            as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too,
            which was of stone. In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had
            escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.
         </p>
         
         <p>All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal
            condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at
            full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this I was securely bound by
            a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left
            arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I saw, to my
            horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my horror;
            for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it appeared to be the
            design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently
            seasoned.
         </p>
         
         <p>Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or forty
            feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its panels a very
            singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time
            as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a
            casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we
            see on antique clocks. There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively. While I
            gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I
            fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some
            minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the
            cell.
         </p>
         
         <p>A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw several
            enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which lay just within
            view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly,
            with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the meat. From this it required much
            effort and attention to scare them away.
         </p>
         
         <p>It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take but
            imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I then saw
            confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much
            greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that it had perceptibly
            descended. I now
            observed--with what horror it is needless to say--that its nether
            extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from
            horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a
            razor. Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty
            rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
         </p>
         
         <p>I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture.
            My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents--the pit
            whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself--the pit,
            typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of
            accidents, and I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an
            important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having
            failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction
            awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.
         </p>
         
         <p>What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch by inch--line
            by line--with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages-down
            and still down it came! Days passed--it might have been that many days passed--ere it
            swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. The odor of the
            sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. I prayed--I wearied
            heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful
            scimitar. And then I fell suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death,
            as a child at some rare bauble.
         </p>
         
         <p>There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon again
            lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum. But it
            might have been long; for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon,
            and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very--oh, inexpressibly sick and weak, as if through long
            inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food.
            With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and
            took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put
            a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought
            of joy--of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a half formed
            thought --man has many such which are never completed. I felt that it was of joy--of hope; but I felt also that it had perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to perfect--to reain it. Long suffering had nearly
            annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile--an idiot.
         </p>
         
         <p>The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw that the
            crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It would fray the serge of my robe-it would return and repeat its operations--again--and again.
            Notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the
            hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still
            the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish.
            And at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention--as if, in so dwelling, I
            could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder upon the
            sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment--upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on
            the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.
         </p>
         
         <p>Down--steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in
            contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--far
            and wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the stealthy pace of
            the tiger! I alternately laughed and bowled as the one or the other idea grew
            predominant.
         </p>
         
         <p>Down--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of my bosom! I
            struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This was free only from the
            elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my
            mouth, with great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings above
            the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might
            as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!
         </p>
         
         <p>Down--still unceasingly--still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled
            at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,
            although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable!
            Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope
            that prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. It was hope--the hope that triumphs on the rack--that whispers to the deathcondemned even in
            the dungeons of the Inquisition.
         </p>
         
         <p>I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time
            during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by
            no separate cord. The first stroke of the razor-like crescent athwart any portion
            of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by
            means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the
            steel! The result of the slightest struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover,
            that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this
            possibility! Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of
            the pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope
            frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--
            save in the path of the destroying crescent.
         </p>
         
         <p>Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously
            alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when
            I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now present--feeble,
            scarcely sane, scarcely definite,--but still entire. I proceeded at once, with the
            nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.
         </p>
         
         <p>For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which
            I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold, ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on
            my part to make me their prey. "To what food," I thought, "have they been
            accustomed in the well."
         </p>
         
         <p>They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small
            remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual see-saw, or wave
            of the hand about the platter; and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. With the
            particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the
            bundage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay
            breathlessly still.
         </p>
         
         <p>At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change--at the
            cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well. But this
            was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their voracity.
            Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped
            upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal for a
            general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to
            the wood--they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage. They
            pressed--they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their
            thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and
            chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that
            the struggle would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I
            knew that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human
            resolution I lay still.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I at length felt
            that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body. But the stroke of the
            pendulum
            already pressed upon my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It
            had cut through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a
            wave of ray hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady
            movement--cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow --I slid from the embrace of the
            bandage and beyond the the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was
            free.
         </p>
         
         <p>Free!--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped
            from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone door of the prison, when the motion of
            the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force,
            through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched Free!--I had but
            escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some
            other. With that thought I rolled my eyes nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual--some change which,
            at first, I could not appreciate distinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the
            apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in
            width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus
            appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of
            course in vain, to look through the aperture.
         </p>
         
         <p>As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at
            once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the outlines of the
            figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colours seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were
            momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy,
            that gave to the spectral and fiendship portraitures an aspect that might have
            thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly
            vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could
            not force my imagination to regard as unreal.
         </p>
         
         <p>Unreal!--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of
            the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A richer
            tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted!
            I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors--oh!
            most unrelenting, oh. most demoniac of men! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that
            impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I
            rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild
            moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At
            length it forced--it wrestled its way into ray soul--it burned itself in upon my
            shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to speak!--oh! horror!--oh! any horror but
            this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my
            hands--weeping bitterly.
         </p>
         
         <p>The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up,
            shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell--and now the change was obviously
            in the form. As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place.
            But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there
            was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors. The
            room had been square. I saw that two of its iron angles
            were now acute--two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful
            difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form
            into that of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here
            --I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace.
            "Death," I said, "any death but that of the pit. Fool,
            might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of
            the burning iron to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or,
            if even that, could I withstand its pressure? And now. flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me
            no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its
            greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank
            back but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.
            At length for my seared and writhing body there was no
            longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I
            struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in
            one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink--I averted my eyes--
         </p>
         
         <p>There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The
            fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting,
            into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French army
            had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.

            </p>
            
            <p>The first of these works has become a semi-classic in English, literature, and
               being one of those books which only wits love to read, for it makes no appeal to
               the vulgar, has not been circulated to the extent that its merits deserve in this country. It is a broad but pleasant satire on the false philosophies and false tastes that were in vogue thirty years ago-but as
               each of its personages represents a class, with a very trifling alteration of
               names, it will apply as well to the errors of the present as to those of the past
               age. The author is neither a poet nor a cynic, but a good-natured scholarly gentleman, who is rather disposed to laugh the world out of its
               errors than to sneer at them; he is neither as startling nor as amusing as
               
               <span class="person" id="jswift">Swift</span>, but he is infinitely more friendly and winning. One would not
               care to be on terms of intimacy with the Dean, but the most sensitive of men
               would never fear the genial humor of the guests of Headlong Hall; or the tenants
               of Nightmare Abbey. McLaurel, the Scottish reviewer, in
               Headlong Hall, might have furnished Bulwer an original for his
               Macgrowler. To be fully appreciated the author should be fully read; some of his works possess considerable novelesque interest, but they depend mainly upon their fine satirical vein. We trust that the publisher
               will bring out the other works of the author in their popular series to render the collection complete. They consist of, Maid Marian, Crotchet
               Castle, Melincourt, and the Misfortunes of Elphin, in addition
               to the two first published.

            <p>The French in Algiers is new and startling; the name of 
               <span class="person" id="lgordon">Lady Gordon</span> on the title
               page, the ingenious translator of the Amber Witch, should alone be sufficient to give it currency.
            </p>
            
            <p>The following extract from the Journal of an officer of the French, who was a
               prisoner to the Arabs, will give an idea of the quality of this interesting
               book:
            </p> 
            
            <p>I had gone only a few steps, when a troop of Arabs suddenly poured out of a
               ravine, came down upon us at full gallop, and surrounded us on all sides. They
               advanced towards me, crying, "Semi! Semi!" (Friends! Friends!) Deceived by these exclamations, I turned to explain them to the Doctor, when one of the Arabs snatched at the musket which I held in my hand; this
               showed me their real intentions, and I instantly fired at the Arab who had tried
               to seize the musket, and broke his shoulder. He dropped his gun, which was
               loaded, and was forced to throw his arm around the neck of his horse to prevent
               falling off. I darted at the gun, but two Arabs took aim at my head, and as
               I turned away to avoid their fire, one ball gave me a slight wound on the head,
               and the other passed through my shirt and grazed my breast.
            </p> 
            
            <p>I had not lost sight of the wounded Arab's gun, and stooped again to pick it up,
               when something rough slipped over my face; I raised my hands to it, and felt a
               rope round my neck; at the same moment, a violent jerk brought me to the ground,
               and an Arab; who had the other end of the rope fastened to his saddle-bow, set
               off at full gallop.
            </p> 
            
            <p>My cries and entreaties were all in vain; the Arab spurred on his horse, and I
               was dragged half-strangled through rocks and briars. This horrible torture lasted
               some minutes, until the horse was forced by steep and stony ground to slacken his
               pace, when I got on my feet again. In spite of the wounds with which my face,
               hands, and legs were covered, and the stunning effects of such a shock, I still
               had strength to seize the cord so as to keep myself from being strangled,
               and to run forward and catch hold of the horse's tail.
            </p> 
            
            <p>But as soon as the other Arabs, who had been dispersed by the sailors sent to
               our assistance, rejoined their companions, I was loaded with abuse and stripped
               nearly naked. Our misfortune had been seen from the brig, which immediately fired
               upon the Arabs; but every shot cost me a fresh shower of blows, and the horse to
               which I was tied took fright at the noise and started forward, and I again fell
               to the ground; the Arabs ran after me, beating me all the time; and if by
               chance I succeeded in getting on my feet, my pitiless persecutor set off again at
               a gallop, casting looks of contempt upon me.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The incessant galloping of the horse, and the violent jerks of the cord which
               dragged and rolled me among the rocks and briars, leaving a track of blood behind
               me--the abuse and the blows of the Arabs, lasted a quarter of an hour: this sounds
               but a short time, but it seemed very long to me.
            </p>
            
            <p>As soon as the Arabs thought themselves out of reach of pursuit, they halted in
               order to cut off my head. The rope was taken off my neck, my hands bound behind
               my back, and I was tied to a dwarf palm-tree. I was so tired, that I lay down
               upon the ground perfectly indifferent to the fate which I knew awaited all
               prisoners taken by the Arabs. I had but one sad thought, of my family and my poor
               sister; but this was soon driven away by the near approach of death, and the
               animated scene in which I, though chained and silent, was the principal
               person.
            </p>
            
            <p>A violent discussion had arisen among the Arabs; they brandished their sabres
               over my head, and each claimed the pleasure of cutting it off, all crying at
               once, "I took him, I have a right to cut off his head and each, to prove the
               truth of his assertion, showed a fragment of my shirt or of my coat. The Arabs
               were already taking aim at one another, and exclaiming, "I ought to cut off his
               head, and I will kill you if you don't let me enjoy my rights," when a horseman
               galloped up and threw into my lap the head of Jonquie, one of the sailors; as I
               turned away in disgust at this horrible spectacle, I saw the Arab whom I had
               wounded lying on the ground about fifty paces off. He could scarcely support
               himself, and was endeavoring to aim at me with a pistol which he held in his left hand. But horsemen were every instant passing to and fro before him,
               and he dropped his hand, patiently awaiting the favorable moment to fire.
            </p> 
            
            <p>I was expecting the end of this horrible discussion with some impatience, when the arrival of another horseman changed the determination of the Arabs. This was Adda, a spy of Abd-el-Kader, who had often visited
               us at Arzew, where he feigned an intention of establishing himself, and allayed any suspicion we might entertain of him, by assuring us that his
               frequent visits were for the purpose of selecting some favorable spot for the
               settlement of his tribe. Delighted at the good will he manifested towards us, we
               had frequently invited him to dinner. But the traitor had far different designs.
               He made use of his visits to mark the exact spot to which our cuttle were driven:
               he had determined to seize them, and it was with that object that he had hidden himself in the ravine with the troop which had taken me
               prisoner.
            </p> 
            
            <p>When Adda saw them furiously disputing who should kill me, he exclaimed that I was an officer, and that Abd-el-Kader would give them much more
               for my head if it was left upon my shoulders, and would willingly replace the
               three horses they had lost if I were taken to him alive.
            </p> 
            
            <p>But the Arabs still continued to brandish their yataghans over my head, with the
               most horrible imprecations against the dog of a Christian.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Adda used still longer arguments; and when the dying Arab had been removed, it was decided that I should be presented alive to Abdel-Kader, who was
               to choose the manner of my death, after paying my ransom and replacing the horses
               which our men had shot.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Just as we were setting off, an Arab brought me a straw hat with poor Jonquie's
               head in it, and bade me carry it. I refused, and was instantly assailed on all
               sides by blows and abuse, and cries of "Carry the head, dog of a Christian."
            </p>
            
            <p>"I will die first," said I, throwing myself on the ground; and the Arabs were
               about to dispatch me with the butt-ends of their rifles, when Adda, who was very anxious to deliver me alive to Abd-elKader, interposed. The head was
               hung to the saddle-bow of one of the Arabs, and after venting their ill-humor on
               me by more blows, we started.
            </p> 
            
            <p>During our journey across the plain of Macta, we stopped at three successive
               wells, where several Arabs of the neighboring tribe met us and drew water for our
               men and horses. I went towards the well to drink, but the Arabs who held the
               bucket spat in my face, saying, "This water is not for a dog of a Christian like
               thee."
            </p>
            
            <p>I made no answer, and went to the next well, but there too the Arab who was
               drawing water spat in my face, and said, "This water is not for a Christian like
               thee."
            </p>
            
            <p>Again I bore it with patience, but the Arab at the third well, not content with
               spitting in my face and addressing the same compliment to me as his predecessors
               had done, dashed a bucket full of water in my face. I was bathed in perspiration,
               and no doubt such treatment would have brought on an inflammation in my chest if
               I had had time to be ill. As it was, I shivered and threw myself on the ground
               (always my last resource,) crying, "You may kill me if you please; I will
               not move another step, I am dying of thirst." This was no more than the truth,
               for my tongue and my mouth were like a piece of dry cork, and I was fainting from thirst. At length Adda went himself, drew some water and brought it
               to me.
            </p> 
            
            <p>We resumed our journey through a country in which the barley harvest was going on, and every time we passed any Arabs at work in the fields or
               a party of horsemen, my guards called out, "Come and see the Christian dog;" and
               they all came and spat in my face, and fired off their muskets close to my head,
               so that the balls whizzed about my ears. I must confess that these demonstrations
               of joy alarmed me a good deal until I got used to them.
            </p> 
            
            <p>During the course of our day's journey we had to ford several rivers; but though
               I was often up to my middle in the water, these barbarians would not allow me to
               take a little in the palm of my hand, till at last, in spite of their threats and
               blows, I flung myself down in the bed of the river and drank deep draughts: this
               refreshed me but for a short time, and at every fresh river I had to resort to
               the same expedient.
            </p> 
            
            <p>At length I fell, exhausted with fatigue. It was three o'clock, and I had walked
               since five in the morning, and my feet were torn and bleeding. The Arabs mounted
               me on one of their horses, but in a quarter of an hour the owner of it dragged me
               off its back by my leg. I walked for two hours more, and then rode again. At length we arrived about nightfall at the camp of the Borgia
               tribe.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Here I was exposed to the blows, insults, and spittings of men, women, and
               children. A tent was pitched for my guards into which I was but half admitted,
               and I lay on the earth beyond the carpet.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Our party had chickens boiled with kuskussu for supper, which they ate voraciously; I should have been very glad of a bit, but they considered me unworthy of such a dainty, and flung me a handful of kuskussu, which I could not swallow, as it was dry and bad, and my throat was so
               sore.
            </p>
            
            <p>We were travelling the road from Mascara to Mostaganem, and my heart beat for
               joy at the sight of the tracks of the French cannon. I hoped that we might fall in with some French out-posts, and for a moment I forgot all my
               misery, and even the putrid and bloody head before me, and fancied myself on
               board the brig and in the arms of my friends and relations, or firing a broadside
               at the Arabs. I was rather roughly waked out of my reverie by a shower of blows
               which the Arabs gave me in order to hasten my horse's pace. In a few minutes I urged the animal on, and immediately they beat me violently,
               crying, "A Christian dog like thee may not dare to strike the horse of an
               Arab."
            </p>
            
            <p>We continued our journey in this manner for six hours, at the end of which the
               Arabs began to shout for joy, and Adda told me that we had reached Abd-el-Kader's
               camp, which is close to the town of Kaala. It was not without emotion that I
               passed the first tents of the man who was to decide my fate.
            </p> 
            Abd-el-Kader. 
            
            <p>Abd-el-Kader's camp stood in a grove of fig trees, on the road from Mascora to
               Mostaganem, and the tracks of the wheels of the French artillery were still
               visible in the very midst of it. On arriving at the first tent my guards forced
               me to dismount, and in a moment I was surrounded by a host of Arabs of every age
               and both sexes, shouting and screaming --"Son of dog," "Dog of a Christian," "Cut
               off his head," &amp;c., with the usual accompaniment of blows and spitting.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Presently the chaous came to my rescue, and by dint of vigorous blows they at
               last succeeded in delivering me from the hands of these savages, and conducted me to Abd-el-Kader's tent. My first reception in the camp had not been
               of a kind fitted to dispel the fears with 
               which I went into his presence. But as soon as Abd-el-Kader saw the
               pallor of my face he smiled and motioned me to sit, saying, "As long as thou art
               with me fear neither insult nor ill usage."
            </p> 
            
            <p>Emboldened by this gracious reception I asked him for something to drink, as, thanks to my guards, I had not drank since the day before.
               Abd-el-Kader immediately ordered me to be conducted to the tent which served as a
               store-house, and there I received a melon, some grapes, white bread, and water.
               The melon was so good, the water so cool, and Abd-el-Kader's manner had been so
               humane, that my hopes and my appetite revived. Alter devouring the melon and
               drinking a whole jar of water, I was again led into the Sultan's presence. His tent is the most magnificent in the camp: it is thirty feet
               long and eleven feet high; the inside is lined with hangings of various
               colors, covered with arasbesques and crescents in red, blue, green, and
               yellow. A woollen curtain divides it into two unequal parts, in the
               futhermost and smaller of which is a mattress on which the Sultan sleeps. At
               the further end is a small entrance for the service of the tent and the slaves
               especially attached to the person of the Sultan: these are Ben Abu and Ben Faka,
               of whom I shall have to say more hereafter. During the day the tent remains open
               and accessible to all.
            </p> 
            
            <p>On the ground, in one comer, lie four silken rags rolled up: these are borne
               before Abd-el-Kader on every march by four horsemen; the flag, belonging to the cavalry, is red; the second, that of the infantry, has a horizontal
               yellow stripe between two blue ones; the third, two horizontal stripes--one green
               and the other white; and the fourth is half red and half yellow. Every Friday
               these flags are unfurled in front of the Sultan's tent. There is also a small
               mattress covered with a carpet, on which lie two red silk cushions; at each end
               of the mattress is a chest, and behind it two other chests; the whole is then
               covered with a carpet, and forms Abd-el-Kader's sofa: the chests contain his clothes and money. A carpet is spread on the ground for
               strangers. These things, together with a high footstool, covered with red
               silk, which serves the Sultan as a horse-block, constitute all the furniture of
               the Sultan's tent. The tent is always guarded by thirty negroes, who are never
               relieved, and have no other bed than the earth. A good many chaous are always in
               attendance, ready to obey the commands of their ruler.
            </p> 
            
            <p>I will now endeavor to describe a man, of whom at present very little is known. From all that I had heard, I expected to find a bloodthirsty
               barbarian, always ready to cut off heads: my expectations were false indeed.
            </p>
            
            <p>Abd-el-Kader is twenty-eight years of age and very small, his face is long and
               deadly pale, his large black eyes are soft and languishing, his mouth small and
               delicate, and his nose rather aquiline; his beard is thin but jet black, and he
               wears a small mustachio, which gives a martial character to his soft and delicate face, and becomes him vastly. His hands are small and exquisitely
               formed, and his feet equally beautiful; the care he takes of them is quite coquettish: he is constantly washing them, and paring and filing his
               nails with a small knife with a beautiful carved mother-of-pearl handle, which he
               holds all the while as he sits crouching on his cushion with his toes clasped
               between his fingers.
            </p> 
            
            <p>His dress is distinguished by the most studied simplicity; there is not a
               vestige of gold or embroidery on any part of it. He wears a shirt of very fine
               linen, the seams of which are covered with a silk braid terminating in a small
               silk tassel. Over the shirt is a haick, and over the haick two white bernouses;
               the uppermost garment is a black bernouse. A few silk tassels are the only
               ornaments about his dress; he wears no arms in his girdle, his head is shaved and
               covered by three or four scullcaps, one within the other, over which he draws the
               hood of his bernouse.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The second time that I went to the Sultan's tent, he was seated on some
               cushions, with his secretaries and some marabouts crouching in a semicircle on
               either side of him: his smiling and graceful countenance contrasted charmingly

            <p>The Sultan, with a smile of the greatest kindness, bade me be seated, and asked me, in Arabic, my name and where I was taken, and on
               my answering his questions, told me to fear nothing so long as I was
               with him.

            <p>It should not be doubted that at least one third of the affection
               with which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain, should be attributed to
               what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simple love of the
               antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact which, while
               it has strict connexion with poetry in the abstract, and with the old British
               poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the
               authors of the poems. Almost every devout admirer of the old bards, if demanded
               his opinion of their productions, would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy, wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps
               say, indefinable delight; on being required to point out the source of this so
               shadowy pleasure, he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology, and
               in general handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to
               ideality, but in the case in question, it arises independently of the author's
               will, and is altogether
               apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied. Verses which
               affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in many instances, may
               be traced to the one source, quainlness, must have worn, in the days of their
               construction, a very common-place air. This is, of course, no argument
               against the poems now--we mean it only as against the poets then. There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned still learned without
               Art. No general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the
               error of supposing 
               <span class="person" id="jdonne">Donne</span> and 
               <span class="person" id="acowley">Cowley</span> metaphysical in the sense wherein 
               <span class="person" id="wwordsworth">Wordsworth</span>
               and 
               <span class="person" id="stcoleridge">Coleridge</span> are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with the two latter
               the means. The poet of the "Creation" wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth --the poet of the
               "Ancient Mariner" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by
               analysis. The one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly
               lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because
               hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the
               "metaphysical verse" of 
               <span class="person" id="acowley">Cowley</span> is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he was in this hut a type of his
               school--for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers
               whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon--to elevate immeasurably all the
               energies of mind--but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force,
               delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and
               imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of
               mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one
               (ceteris paribus) more artificial.
            </p>
            
            <p>We cannot bring ourselves to believe, that the selections of the "Book of Gems"
               are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to show the school's
               character, the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us, of the
               most despicable trash, with no merit whatever, beyond that of their antiquity.
               The criticisms of the Editor do not particularly please us. His enthusiasm is too
               general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion, for example, of Sir
               
               <span class="person" id="hwotton">Henry Wotton</span>'s "Verses on the Queen of Bohemia"--that "there are few finer
               things in our language" is untenable and absurd. We quote the lines:

               <br></br>More by your number than your light,
               
               <br></br>You common people of the skies,
               
               <br></br>What are you when the sun shall rise?
               
               <br></br>You curious chanters of the wood,
               
               <br></br>That warble forth dame Nature's lays,

               <br></br>Like the proud virgins of the year,
               
               <br></br>As if the spring were all your own,
               
               <br></br>What are you when the rose is blown?

               <br></br>By virtue first, then choice, a queen,
               
               <br></br>Tell me if she were not designed
               
               <br></br>Th' eclipse and glory of her kind?
            </div>
            
            <p>In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy which belong to her under all circumstan
               ces and throughout all time. Here every thing is art--naked
               or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession) should induce us to
               dignify with the sacred name of Poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and
               threadbare compliments, stitched, apparently, together, without fancy,
               without plausibility, and without even an attempt at adaptation.
            </p>
            
            <p>In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with "The
               Shepherd's Hunting," by Wither--a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the
               peculiarities of II Penseroso. Speaking of Poesy, the author says:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               
               <br></br>By the murmur of a spring
               
               <br></br>Or the least boughs rusteling,
               
               <br></br>By a daisy whose leaves spread
               
               <br></br>Shut when Titan goes to bed,
               
               <br></br>Or a shady bush or tree
               
               <br></br>She could more infuse in me
               
               <br></br>Than all Nature's beauties can
               
               <br></br>In some other wiser man.
               
               <br></br>By her help I also now
               
               <br></br>Make this churlish place allow
               
               <br></br>Something that may sweeten gladness
               
               <br></br>In the very gall of sadness--
               
               <br></br>The dull loneness, the black shade
               
               <br></br>That these hanging vaults have made,
               
               <br></br>The strange music of the waves
               
               <br></br>Beating on these hollow caves,
               
               <br></br>This black den which rocks emboss
               
               <br></br>Overgrown with eldest moss,
               
               <br></br>The rude portals that give light
               
               <br></br>More to terror than delight,
               
               <br></br>This my chamber of neglect
               
               <br></br>Walled about with disrespect
               
               <br></br>From all these and this dull air
               
               <br></br>A fit object for despair,
               
               <br></br>She hath taught me by her might
               
               <br></br>To draw comfort and delight.
            </div>
            
            <p>But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the English antique. Something more of this will be
               found in 
               <span class="person" id="rcorbet">Corbet</span>'s "Farewell Rewards and Fairies!" We copy a portion
               of 
               <span class="person" id="">Marvell</span>'s "Maiden lamenting for her Fawn"--which we prefer not
               only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem
               abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness, to
               any thing of its species:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               
               <br></br>It is a wondrous thing how fleet
               
               <br></br>'Twas on those little silver feet,
               
               <br></br>With what a pretty skipping grace
               
               <br></br>It oft would challenge me the race,
               
               <br></br>And when't had left me far away,
               
               <br></br>'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
               
               <br></br>For it was nimbler much than hinds,
               
               <br></br>And trod as if on the four winds.
               
               <br></br>I have a garden of my own,
               
               <br></br>But so with roses overgrown,
               
               <br></br>And lilies that you would it guess
               
               <br></br>To be a little wilderness;
               
               <br></br>And all the spring-time of the year
               
               <br></br>It only loved to be there.
               
               <br></br>Among the beds of lilies I
               
               <br></br>Have sought it oft where it should lie,
               
               <br></br>Yet could not till itself would rise
               
               <br></br>Find it, although before mine eyes.
               
               <br></br>For in the flaxen lilies shade,
               
               <br></br>It like a bank of lilies laid;
               
               <br></br>Upon the roses it would feed
               
               <br></br>Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
               
               <br></br>And then to me 'twould boldly trip,
               
               <br></br>And print those roses on my lip,
               
               <br></br>But all its chief delight was still
               
               <br></br>With roses thus itself to fill,
               
               <br></br>And its pure virgin limbs to fold
               
               <br></br>In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
               
               <br></br>Had it lived long it would have been
               
               <br></br>Lilies without, roses within.
               
            </div>
            
            <p>How truthful an air of lamentation hangs here upon every syllable! It pervades
               all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words "over the gentleness and grace
               which we fancy in the little maiden herself" even over the half-playful, halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good
               qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, "and all sweet dowers." The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea--conveying
               either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the artlessness of the maiden,
               or her love, or her admiration, or her grief, or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little nest-like bed of lilies and roses
               which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them, and could scarcely be distinguished
               from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an
               arch and rosy smile on her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and
               delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted--the wonder of the maiden at the fleetness of her favorite--the "little silver feet"--the fawn
               challenging his mistress to a race with "a pretty skipping grace," running on
               before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive all these
               things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">

            </div>
            
            <p>a vigor fully apparent only when we keep in mind the artless
               character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite --one for each wind.
               Then consider the garden of "my own," so overgrown--entangled--with roses and
               lilies, as to be "a little wilderness"--the fawn, loving to be there, and
               there "only"--the maiden seeking it "where it should lie"-- and not being able
               to distinguish it from the flowers until "itself would rise"--the lying among the
               lilies "like a bank of lilies"--the loving to "till itself with roses,"
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               
               <br></br>And its pure virgin limbs to fold

            </div>
            
            <p>and these things being its "chief" delights--and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines-whose very hyperbole only renders them more
               true to nature when we consider the innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate grief, and more passionate admiration of the
               bereaved child--

            <p>This really magnificent work increases, with each issue, in the value of its illustrations. The present number contains a view of the Hill of
               Samaria from an original drawing by W. H. Bartlett, engraved by J. C. Bentley. It
               is an admirable engraving, worthy to accompany the beautifully printed text.

         <p>Since Mr. Bancroft has taken possession of his department
            in the government of our twenty millions of free people, he
            has issued a command to that portion who are subject to his
            rule, ordering them to shave all the lower part of their faces.
            No hair is allowed to grow in the Navy below the corner of
            a man's mouth. Mr. Bancroft being a liberal Christian, a
            man of the world, and a descendant of the pilgrim stock, is
            the last man in the Union from whom we should expect such
            an evidence of barberism as this. Of all other men in the
            world sailors need their beards most to protect their throats
            from the cold and wet to which they are exposed, and
            of all other men in the world they have the fewest conveniences for shaving. The necessity of the beard has never
            been disputed by an intelligent being, and that depriving the
            face and throat of their natural covering causes a great many of the neuralgic and thoracic diseases which enfeeble
            and destroy life among men, is acknowledged by all physicians. But if there were no other reason for preserving the
            beard than the fact of its beautifying the face, and giving an
            aspect of gravity and dignity to the wearer, that alone should
            be sufficient to save it from the razor. Sailors and Soldiers
            need all the natural advantages that give them an air of
            manliness, and, instead of dressing them up like monkies,
            with bits of red and yellow cloth, and feathers and tinsel,
            if they were dressed in plain clothes, and allowed to wear their
            beards naturally, their dignity of aspect would go farther to
            beget courage and respect among themselves, and fear in
            their enemies, than all the artificial appliances that military
            folly has ever conceived. It is the fashion with some of our
            volunteer corps when they march through the streets in their
            fancy dresse , looking like a troupe of chorus singers before
            the foot lights in a melo-drama, to be preceded by two or
            three pioneers, who to give themselves an air of gravity and
            determination, tie false beards upon their chins, making the
            smooth-faced men who follow them look like a corps of Miss
            
            <span class="person" id="smfuller">Fuller</span>'s women soldiers. We saw in a South American
            port, once, the crew of an English frigate who all wore their
            beards, from the captain downwards, and we were amazed
            to see such a collection of magnificent looking men. They
            were probably no finer looking than any other crew of Englishmen, but their beards give them a most noble and dignified appearance. We do not wonder that the Captains of
            our National Ships should take upon themselves the authority to compel the men under their charge to trim their whiskers in conformity with a particular pattern, because little
            tyrants are greedy of every petty occasion to show their power. But that the Secretary of the Navy, in this enlightened
            age, when even dandies and counter jumpers are beginning to
            assert their manliness by allowing their beards to grow,
            should be guilty of this hirsute tyranny, is indeed monstrous.
            The advantages of wearing the beard naturally are too evident to need enumerating, while no good of any sort or degree can result from shaving. The practice originated in
            the basest motives among a people of effeminate and degraded habits, and it has been continued down to the present
            day by the spirit of conservatism that causes two thirds of the
            miseries which men endure.
         </p>
         
         <p>The ancient German nations shaved the beard except that on the
            upper lip. The ancient Goths, Franks, Gauls, and Britons, also wore
            long beards, but at the introduction of Christianity, the laity began
            by degrees to imitate the clergy, who were shaven. The Danes appear to have worn their beards. The Normans shaved their beards
            entirely, and looked upon the appendage with so much distaste as an
            indication of misery and distress, that they were the great apostles of
            shaving wherever they came. Accordingly they endeavoured to persuade or compel the English to shave the hair of their upper fips.
            The great majority yielded to the necessity of the case, but therewere many who chose to leave the country rather than resign their
            whiskers. However, beards again had their day. In the 14th century, they became again fashionable, and continued until the beginning of the 17th. At the latter date their dimensions had become
            more contracted, and they were soon after relinquished, the mustache
            only being retained; and at the commencement of the last century the
            practice of shaving the whole face had become universal. In the latter changes the example of France was followed. In that country,
            Charles IV., was the last sovereign who wore a beard, and he had a
            tolerably fine one. He was succeeded by a beardless minor, in compliment to whom the courtiers shaved all their beards except the
            mustaches, ultimately the mustaches also disappeared. The Spaniards, more tardily influenced by French example, kept their beards
            till the French and English were beginning to relinquish even mustaches. Perhaps they would have kept the cherished appendage to
            this day, but a French prince (Philip V.) mounted the throne with a
            shaven chin. The courtiers, with heavy hearts, imitated the prince;
            and the people, with still heavier hearts, imitated the courtiers. The
            popular feeling on the subject, however, remains recorded in the proverb, "Since we have lost our beards, we have lost our souls."
         </p>
         
         <p>Sometimes the clergy of the Western Church were enjoined to wear
            beards, under an impression that shaving was an effeminate practice,
            and that a beard well became the gravity of the ecclesiastical character; and at other times shaving was enforced from an idea that pride
            was too apt to lurk beneath a venerable beard. It is related that
            Guillaume Duprat, Bishop of Clermont, who assisted at the council of
            Trent, and built the College of the Jesuits at Paris, had the finest
            beard that was ever seen. It was too fine a beard for a bishop: and
            the canons of his Cathedral, in full chapter assembled, came to the barbarous resolution of shaving him. Accordingly, when he next came
            to the choir, the dean, the provost and the chantre approached with
            scissors and razors, soap, basin and warm water.--He took to his heels
            at the sight, and escaped to his castle of Beauregard, about two miles
            from Clermont, where he fell sick from vexation and died.
         </p>
         
         <p>A precious good fellow was Guillaume Duprat, and we
            wish that the ecclesiastic who at present rules our Navy
            was of a similar kidney. But if all the officers of the Service were of our mind they would wear their beards and
            wag them too in spite of all the orders the Secretary could
            issue. We would like to see an officer court martialed for
            disobedience of such an order, to test the right of a citizen to
            his own hair. If Mr. Bancroft may compel the officers in
            the service to shave their faces he may compel them to emasculate themselves in some other manner; he may next take
            it into his wise head to command them to crop their ears or
            knock out their molars.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Walker on Beauty," in speaking of shaving the beard, says,
            it "has especially been the case in degenerate and effeminate times:
            and this has sometimes been accompanied by remarkable consequences.
         </p>
         
         <p>"One of the greatest misfortunes, says a French writer, which
            France ever had to lament, the divorce of Louis le Jeune from Elinor
            of Guyenne, resulted from the fashion, which this prince wished to introduce, of shaving his chin and cropping his head. The queen, his
            wife, who appears to have possessed, with a masculine beauty, considerable acuteness of intellect, observed, with some displeasure, that she
            imagined herself to have espoused a monarch, not a monk. The obstinacy of Louis in shaving himself, and the horror conceived by Elinor at the sight of a beardless chin, occasioned France the loss of
            those fine provinces which constituted the dowry of this princess; and
            which, devolving to England by a second marriage, became the source
            of wars which desolated France during four hundred years.
         </p>
         
         <p>"The habit of wearing the beard is a manly and noble one. Nature
            made it distinctive of the male and female; and its abandonment has
            commonly been accompanied not only by periods of general effeminacy, but even by the decline and fall of States. They were bearded
            Goths who vanquished the then beardless Romans; and they are bearded Tartars who now promise once more to inundate the regions occupied by the pope. Those, assuredly, blunder, who ridicule the wearing of the beard. Silly affectation, or the contrary, is imputable only
            to those who, by removing the beard, take the trouble so far to emasculate themselves! and who think themselves beautiful by an unnatural imitation of the smoother face of women?"
         </p>
         
         <p>Perhaps Mr. Bancroft's next order will be that every man
            in the service shall provide himself with a dozen boxes of
            Mons. Gouraud's Poudre Subtile before going to sea, and we
            expect to see the Navy agents advertising for hair tweezers
            for our ships of war, and small pocket mirrors for the sailors
            to enable them to trim their eye-brows in conformity with
            orders from Washington.
         </p>
         
         <p>There seems to be a strong opposition to any thing in the
            shape of manliness whether of feeling, or look, in the dignitaries of our Naval Service. Among the rest of the rigmarole
            published by Captain 
            <span class="person" id="cwilkes">Wilkes</span> in his narrative of the Exploring Expedition, we find these man-milliner remarks in one
            of his manifestos.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>"The undersigned, in calling the attention of the officers of the
            squadron under his command to their personal appearance, would observe, that in his opinion, the example of some of them in this respect
            is not such as should indicate to the crews of the different vessels,
            composing the squadron, the necessity which exists of the greatest attention being paid to their personal appearance and cleanliness, in
            conformity to the internal rules and regulations of the squadron.
         </p>
         
         <p>"He has not been aware until recently of the extent to which the
            wearing of mustachios has been carried! they, in most cases, give a
            notoriety and appearance of want of attention to neatness, &amp;c."
         </p>
         
         <p>Note.--Since writing the above we have discovered that
            Mr. Bancroft's order was not officially announced, but as we
            are informed that it will be soon our remarks will apply
            when the order appears.

         <div class="biblTitle">Titian's Venus</div>
         <div class="biblPage">316</div>
         
         <div class="head">TITIAN'S VENUS.</div>
         
         <p>There is a picture exhibiting in Broadway which the proprietors say is a duplicate, made by Titian's own hand of the celebrated
            picture now in Florence. It is stated to have been in the possession
            of Sir Thomas Lawrence, and to have been admired by "the lamented Alston." But no story is told of the manner in which so remarkable a work came to this country. All this looks very suspicious. A genuine painting by Titian, of any description, is not a
            thing easily obtained, and one of this size and in such preservation
            would be worth a handsome fortune. If it were in Italy no Italian
            government would allow it to be taken away, and if it were in England or France, any European government would buy it at a price
            which few individuals could afford to pay. Considering, therefore,
            the importance which a picture by one of the old masters derives
            from its authenticity being established, we wonder that the owner
            of this painting should not have published a full and particular account of the manner in which it came into his hands, the price paid
            for it, &amp;.C. We have seen it stated in some of the daily papers that
            it once formed a part of the collection in the Louvre, but had been
            removed at the restoration of the Bourbons. This is a mistake.
            The Louvre possessed 23 paintings by Titian, but there was no
            Venus among them. If such a painting as this professes to be, had
            been in existence, it would have been known to the whole world;
            but no history of art that we are acquainted with makes any allusion
            to it.
         </p>
         
         <p>But whether it be the work of Titian or not, is a point of little
            importance to nine spectators out of ten; it is a very fine picture,
            and worthy of Titian whether ho painted it or not, and we would
            advise all those who wish to see a really fine painting to call and
            inspect it, and take it for granted that it is the work of an old master. It is a difficult matter to decide from internal evidence on the
            authenticity of any painting. The most expert picture dealers are
            often dreadfully deceived. Even some of Raffaelle's most famous
            paintings are questioned. Very competent judges have recently
            decided that the most universally admired of Raffaelle's pictures,
            the "Madonna della Seggiolo," of which there are probably thousands of copies in this country, is not a century and a half old.
         </p>
         
         <p>The only test therefore by which we should try a work of art is
            the delight it gives us; and we believe that there are very few persons who could honestly say that Titian's real paintings gave them
            more real pleasure than this of Venus. We think that the proprietor
            has injured the character of the work by setting apart a day for the
            admission of women only. No picture should he looked upon by a
            woman alone which she would hesitate to look at in the company
            of her father or brother. For ourselves we think that very old and
            very young men would do well not to give the Venus exhibiting in
            Broadway a call.

            <p>The Southern Literary Messenger for May, has, among other good papers, a caustic
               review of Captain 
               <span class="person" id="">Wilkes</span>' Narrative of the U. S. Exploring
               Expedition. The overbearing conceit, the ignorance and the tyranny of the
               Commander, are here displayed as they should be--and we recommend the whole article to his serious attention. More ludicrous instances of incompetency were never afforded by any American naval officer than
               by him. Neither his discretion nor his education would have entitled
               him to the command of a fishing smack. His grammatical blunders, in especial, are
               of a kind that must bring a flush of shame into the face of every American who reads the book. What but the grossest obtusity combined with the most ineffable conceit and self-sufficiency, could have induced
               Captain 
               <span class="person" id="cwilkes">Wilkes</span> to trust his composition to the public eye without
               the supervision of his clerk--or of some respectable school-boy? We give a brace
               of his sentences:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Harmony and good feeling he would enjoin upon all: the necessity
               of cultivating this, and the united exertions of ail, cannot claim too much of
               your attention."
            </p>
            
            <p>"You may rest assured also of receiving impartial justice from me,
               and that in the assignment of duties and promotions, if any should occur! and that all will have the opportunities they desire of entering
               upon the scientific duties, nothing shall be wanting that can tend to
               this end."
            </p>
            
            <p>This number has also a paper of much historical interest
               --a "Sketch of the Military services of Guilford Dudley in
               the Carolinas during the Revolution." A criticism on the Poems of 
               <span class="person" id="cpcranch">Christopher Pease Cranch</span> is not particularly to our
               taste. It is better, however, than the commentary on Miss
               
               <span class="person" id="">Barrett</span> which appeared in a late number of the Messenger,
               and which, as far as we can learn, excited no less decided a
               feeling than universal contempt wherever it was perused by
               those who are themselves poetical. This is a topic on which
               we could not forbear speaking out if we would. It is in our
               opinion, something even worse than sacrilege--this entrusting to such hands the august works of

               the unutterable loathing which crept over us as we read
               those flippant comments on poems which, if we are entitled
               to estimate the merit of anything by its effect on the greatest
               intellects and on the noblest hearts--are divine, if there be
               any divinity within the soul of man.

            <p>Godey's Lady's Book for June is, also, already issued,

            <div class="head">ONSLAUGHT UPON THE CRITICS, BY ONE OF THE MIRROR SCHOOL.</div>
            
            <p>We have been highly amused by a ridiculously severe
               article in one of the large sized weeklies, upon the musical
               critics of New-York. The subject is really a capital subject, and handled by a competent person, much that is curious
               and surprising might be evolved by its consideration. But the
               person who wrote the article in question, brings no other qualification to the task, than a Mirror certificate, which is utter
               ignorance of the subject on which he treats. He might to
               be sure lay some claim to a knowledge of music, after the
               fashion of the gentleman who on being asked if he had ever
               been to Germany, replied "no," but added, that he ought to
               know something about it, as his uncle played a leetle on the
               German flute! so, by a parity of reasoning, our friend the
               critic, ought to know something of music, as he is the worser
               half of one singer, the brother-in-law to another.
            </p>
            
            <p>He treats us very tenderly--he says we are very capable
               of writing a good and correct criticism, but he complains that
               we seldom choose to write a just or a fair one. What a terribly bad fellow we must be. He says our pen is always dipped in gall!--which accounts, probably, for the freedom of
               our style. This is the unkindest thing he says, and, feeling
               the reproof deeply, we have, through the agency of our polite
               and enterprising independent Postmaster General Hale, procured a precious pot of the delicious honey from Hybla, in
               which we have dipped our crow quill, for the especial benefit of our friend, who will, we trust, enjoy the luscious flavor
               of our vehicle.
            </p>
            
            <p>The critic of critics, praises, by implication, the original
               New World, the musical department of which was edited by
               us for four years--is he not a discriminating critic? The critic
               of critics admires the "good taste and judgment perceptible in
               the criticisms of the Albion," all of which, for the last eighteen months, were written by us! O wise critic: a second Daniel, or some other Jewish critic, come to judgment. This
               critic of critics doubtless admires his own paper, in which, by
               the bye, as far as his department is concerned, he stands in
               a position of enviable singularity, but we must inform him
               that the first musical impulse was given to it by ourselves;
               and if he has quietly appropriated the credit due to us
               for what we did for him, we are content,--we can well
               spare it.
            </p>
            
            <p>We warn our musical friends to be specially polite to this
               gentleman, for his power does not end with the large weekly. O no! he is,--we fear to pronounce what he is even to
               ourself--but in the strictest confidence and in the softest whisper we tell you that he is one of the council of the incapables--we should have said, one of the inscrutable Council of Ten,
               who govern the destinies of the Town. This is a fearful power in
               the hands of so terrible a critic, for here he can lash his friend and foe
               alike; can hold them up to ridicule; expose their private concerns to
               a public, greedy for scandal, and do many equally honorable things
               under the cover of obscurity. Such men always attack those they
               hate or envy, behind a screen, and generally choose some defenceless
               person, some way or other connected with the object of their enmity,
               as their grand point of assault, for the reason that they can thus injure two at once.
            </p>
            
            <p>We do not envy the critic of the large weekly his double occupation: in the one he only renders himself ridiculous, while in the other
               he becomes infamous. We advise him to employ himself more honorably, as we suppose he can, if there be any truth in the title pages
               of books, in which his name appears as translator; but it is a dangerous practice to affix one's name to any strange manuscript that may
               fall into one's possession by accident, for the real Simon Pure may
               turn up one of these days.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have not done with this gentleman yet. We will amuse our
               readers with some specimens of his style, which is an amalgamation
               of ignorance, presumption and slang.

            <div class="head">NEW YORK SACRED MUSIC SOCIETY.</div>
            
            <p>We attended the performance of the Oratorio of the Creation, at
               the Tabernacle on Friday evening last, and were, comparatively speaking only, much gratified: for the last concert given by the society,
               (the Messiah) was any thing but creditable to the management, whether
               as respects the principal singers, the chorus, or the band. On this occasion we had at any rate two artists, Mrs. E. Loder and Mr. Henry
               Phillips, capable of giving the music of Haydn as it ought to be given. and in a way, in fact, not to be approached by any other two singers on this continent. It would be impossible to speak too highly of
               With Verdure Clad, as sung by Mrs. Loder, or of the various recitatives and airs allotted to Mr. Phillips. And here we would stop: but
               we are compelled to notice other parts of the performance which were
               obnoxious to criticism. To begin with the Orchestra: There is invariably a want of steadiness and unanimity among the instruments
               which is not even compensated by a strict attention to time. We can
               only account for the latter defect by supposing that there are some
               young hands in the Orchestra who have left the schoolroom too soon.
               The management should not allow this. Half a dozen inefficient performers will always destroy the effect of a Band, let the remainder be
               ever so perfect. With regard, however, to the frequent deviation
               from strict time, so observable among the gentlemen composing this
               orchestra, what shall we say? Is it owing to its great width, which
               prevents those on the north side from hearing what is doing on the
               south side? Is it the fault of the performers in not condescending to
               watch the baton of the conductor? or, is the sole blame attachable to
               the conductor? We can hardly presume the latter to be the case,
               considering the number of years Mr. U. C. Hill has held this responsible office; but be the fault where it may, it should be forthwith remedied.
            </p>
            
            <p>With regard to the Chorus which is very numerous, and [consequently less governable, we have always considered that department
               of the Society the most efficient; and any praise due to Mr. Hill on
               this score we freely give him.
            </p>
            
            <p>The choruses on Friday evening were, some of them, very well performed, particularly The Heavens are Telling. The Lord is Great,
               which comes in after the trio Most Beautiful Appears, was not so well
               executed.
            </p>
            
            <p>The other vocalists of the evening were Miss Northall, Mr. Oakley, and Mr. Andrews. Of Miss N. we have before spoken. She has a
               good clear voice, of sufficient compass for the general run of soprano
               songs; and, in the course of time, she will, doubtless, take a very respectable rank in her profession. She is quite young, and, with all due
               deference to her advisers, we think she has been put forward too
               soon to sing such music as that in the Messiah and the Creation. Thus
               her execution of the recitative And God said let the waters and air; On
               mighty Pens, was evidently beyond her powers; but the young lady is
               improving.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of Mr. Oakley, who comes from Boston, we are disposed to speak
               favorably in consideration of his being a visitor: but we cannot like
               him--we mean his singing. He has a voice loud enough to be heard
               any where, with compass enough to sing up to any thing; he evidently sings as well as he can,and gives the music tolerably correct. We
               cannot explain our antipathy more intelligibly than by saying we are
               always delighted with good, chaste, classical singing, and that, therefore, (we presume) we do not like Mr. Oakley. Of Mr. Andrews, we
               have much pleasure in speaking in terms of praise. His voice is a
               bass of moderate compass, but exceedingly good quality, so good in
               fact, that it reminded us of Henry Phillips's more than once. His
               style is good. The two duetts with Mrs. Loder, By thee with bliss, and
               graceful consort, were very well sung; and though we cannot undertake to say how Mr. A. would have got through music of a more prominent nature, we must do him the justice to say, that on this occasion he acquitted himself well, very well. We hope to hear him often
               in the concert room. **
            </p>
            
            <p>We will now make a few remarks upon the government of this society. It has been for several years weak in action, obstinate in
               folly, and blind to its true interests. It has been governed now by
               one clique, and anon by another, upon principles generally of self-interest, until the policy has become contracted, bigoted. With every
               facility afforded it by its liberal charter, in what position do we at
               present find this society? Is it prosperous, popular, or efficient?
               We answer, no! What little success it has met with is of so recent
               a date, that no certain augury for the future can be drawn from it. It
               may prove but the rallying of the energies previous to the flitting
               away of the life for ever. But a few months since and the Sacred
               Music Society, incorporated according to an act of the Legislature,
               had fallen from its supposed palmy slate to a body of some forty or
               fifty members; so miserable were the prospects, so poor the attendance at meetings, and so dispirited were the members, that we are
               told that it was actually proposed to disband the society. However,
               some active and determined individuals took the society in hand, and
               in a short time, by some extraordinary legerdemain, swelled its number of members to an extraordinary amount. Especial care they also
               took to ensure the prosperity of the society, by making the members
               support it; in other words, they assess each member according to
               the probable expense of the Concerts, from one to two dollars each,
               for which they have a certain number of tickets which they can
               either sell or give away.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of its popularity the best proof is, that when the members gave an
               irregular Concert for some national purpose, in which they defended
               entirely upon the public, the expenses for getting up the Concert
               were not covered by the receipts. We were told that on this occasion, one of the most spirited and liberal among the officers made up
               the difference.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of its efficiency we have given descriptions any time these five
               years. Two years ago it was far superior in choral excellence to
               what it is at present. Then most of the members had practised for
               years, and were supposed to be somewhat conversant with the music
               they had to perform; now the members are mostly novices, and however willing the public may be to believe them capable, one performance is quite sufficient to destroy all confidence in their ability to do
               justice to aught save a simple psalm tune.
            </p>
            
            <p>We repeat that the material is good, but it is profitless, being
               thrown away--wasted.
            </p>
            
            <p>When the government or head of a society cannot be depended
               upon, how can a society flourish? Facts speak for themselves. A
               certain party is engaged to sing--terms are agreed upon, and music
               given for study. Information arrives that an individual threatens, if
               the engagement is persisted in, that he will withdraw himself,
               daughters, music, &amp;c. from the society! The society is compelled
               to yield to the individual, and the engagement is begged off. Another
               engagement is made, and again broken, because some other member
               of the government had engaged somebody else. Can any society, so
               governed, hope for success? Are such governments worthy of confidence?
            </p>
            
            <p>Unless an entire and beneficial revolution takes place in the management of the N. Y. S. M. S. the off-shoots from its body will
               spring up, and over-shadowing it, draw the life blood from the
               parent stem.
            </p>
            
            <p>We shall, in a future number, detail to the public how little this
               over-praised institution has of late years effected in the cause of
               music.

            <p>Castle Garden.--This really elegant and extensive place of
               amusement, opened for the season on Monday last. Signoras Valtellina &amp; Pico, Signori Antognini and Sanquirico, with a large chorus and
               effective band, were the attraction of the evening. A very large audience was present, and it delighted us to find Signora Valtellina so
               warmly recceived. This lady has never been duly appreciated by the
               public, but we trust that she will now meet with the success she deserves.

         <p>By an extract from a private letter to the editor of the Albion, is
            appears that Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="acmritchie">Mowatt</span> has had a most warm reception in Philadelphia, on the score of the great popularity of Fashion, not the great
            racer so called, but the five act comedy of which she, Mrs. M. is the
            author. The play bills, printed on satin, in letters of gold, we easily
            picture to our mind's eye, but the "most regal style," as applied to
            the new American house, is quite beyond our understanding. We
            quote from the Albion's letter:
         </p>
         
         <p>"Fashion drew to the Theatre crowds of people of a class that had not
            been there in years, and the management, to show their appreciation of the
            comedy, invited Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="acmritchie">Mowatt</span> to visit Philadelpha as their guest, and received her in most regal style, in splendid apartments at the new American
            House, providing a carriage for her special use during the whole visit. On
            the night of her benefit, play bills printed on satin in letters of gold were
            presented to Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="acmritchie">Mowatt</span>, and the performers seemed to outrival all previous efforts.
         </p>
         
         <p>"At the conclusion, in consequence of the repeated plaudits of the audience and calls for the authoress, Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="acmritchie">Mowatt</span> rose from her seat and bowed
            to them several times. The loud calls still continuing, Mr. Blake, the popular manager, and who had made so decided a hit in his delineation of the
            old farmer from Cattaraugus, stepped forward, and in a handsome speech,
            thanked them in the name of the authoress for their favourable reception
            which he hailed as the assurance that the time was near at hand, when the
            American people would possess an American Dramatic Literature of their
            own. That, encouraged by their kind reception, Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="acmritchie">Mowatt</span> would endeavour to render the next Comedy upon which she was now engaged more
            worthy of their approbation, and the curtain then fell, amid the most tumultuous uproar. This was on the 13th night of the performance of
            Fashion."

            </div>
            
            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work yet published in this
               country. Where pupils have used this method the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises,
               scales and studies, are given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of
               pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
               otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived
               when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the
               study of such methods as 
               <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span>'s that pupils will be enabled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rudments of music
               being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson is fully explained by
               marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from professional
               gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of 
               <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span>'s Method over all others yet

            <p>The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France; and every
               facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
            </p>
            
            <p>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course includes
               Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic, with Composition. Reading
               aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the daily exercises of the whole school.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of Ancient and
               Modern History and the French Language.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the higher or AEsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough English
               course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and Greek, according to the
               wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
            </p>
            
            <p>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Composition, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from 
               <span class="person" id="jdymond">Dymond</span>,
               as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures on various subjects are
               delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and the general course of study is
               advanced and rendered interesting by copious illustrations from French and English
               Literature.

            <p>LONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WESTMINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.</p>
            
            <p>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their arrival by the
               British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on fine white paper and are faithful copies of the originals--Blackwood's Magazine being an exact fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.
            </p>
            
            <p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to say much
               to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of any works of a similar
               stamp now published, while their political complexion is marked by a dignity, candor, and
               forbearance not often found in works of a party character.
            </p>
            
            <p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory, and
               Radical. "Blackwood" and the "London Quarterly" are Tory; the "Edinburgh Review" Whig; and the "Westminster" Radical. The "Foreign Quarterly" is purely literary, being devoted
               principally to criticisms on foreign Continental Works.
            </p>
            
            <p>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign copies; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advantage to the American
               over the English reader.
