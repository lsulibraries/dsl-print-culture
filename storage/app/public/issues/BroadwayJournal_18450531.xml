         <div class="head">THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH.</div>
         
         <p>The South has just triumphed on northern soil. The 
            mare Peytona beat the mare Fashion nearly half a neck’s 
            length in a race of two heats. This is a glorious victory for 
            the South, and being the first of the kind that she has 
            won, must produce an immense sensation among the "domestic institutions.” There will be a tremendous rustling 
            of the palmettos. In all trials of skill between the South 
            and the North, the North has heretofore come off conqueror; 
            Eclipse and Henry, Webster and Hayne, Fashion and Boston. 
            But now the tide has turned, and success is flowing from 
            north of Mason and Dixon’s Line towards Cottondom. First
            the chivalry of the palmetto State triumphed over old Mr. 
            Hoar and his young daughter, then Peytona beat Fashion, 
            and now we perceive that Mr. Simms is fluttering the Volscians in Cambridge; having taken the Ursa Major of literary Yankeedom by the ears, in his last magazine. We have 
            not much faith in the "parochial review,”as some of our literary people irreverently call the North American, ourselves, 
            particularly since it passed into the hands of its present keeper, and we are not disposed to regard Mr. Simms’ attack with 
            much dismay, for if the “conservative” North American 
            were altogether extinguished, we doubt whether its loss 
            would have any sensible, or, rather, perceptible effect upon 
            the literature or the morals of the nation. As it is not probable that many of our readers are readers of the Southern
            Magazine, we will extract a part of Mr. Simms’ article, that 
            they may see in what estimation the North American is 
            held at the South.

         <p>A CIRCULAR, recently issued by the publishers of the North 
            American Review, somewhat earnestly insists upon the claims of 
            this "veteran” periodical to the favor of the public, in "having 
            done its part in representing the taste, science and literature of the 
            country, for a period of nearly thirty years.” It is certainly matter 
            of surprise that it should become necessary for a periodical, situated 
            in the very heart of a region equally rich and populous, to send
            forth a paper which dwells, in language of doubtful delicacy, upon 
            its claims to public favor, in order to obtain if,—particularly, too, 
            when you shall not meet a man in the whole country who is not 
            willing to attest the perfect fidelity of this work to a people equally 
            ambitious of ascendancy and needing a champion. That the 
            “North American Review” has worked religiously for New England, her sons, her institutions, her claims of every sort, there is no 
            manner of question. Whatever doubts we may entertain of the 
            American character of this periodical, of its catholic tendency, and 
            its equal regard to the claims of the nation, as a whole, we can 
            have none, and none have ever been felt or expressed, of its perfect devotedness to the region from which it more immediately issues. None can deny the exclusive and jealous vigilance with 
            which it insists upon the pretensions of Massachusetts Bay—the 
            merits of its policy, the wisdom of its statesmen, the superior excellence of its genius generally—of its works of arts, its works of 
            imagination, its historians, its poets, its romances. The very humblest of these is not suffered to escape recognition and land, and it 
            is a daily surprise to other parts of the world, to perceive how little 
            effort of their own, the Birds of the Charles, and other contiguous 
            waters—rare birds indeed—are lifted into the perfect purity and
            size of the Swan, with only a little pleasant puffing from the plumes 
            of the"North American.” With a gift like this, it is certainly 
            matter of wonder to us all, that such a circular as the one before 
            us, should need to pass beyond the single province of the Review 
            itself. Why, the poets alone, and the essayists, the writers of pilgrim-orations, the tractarians and sermonizers, the makers of naional school books and Parley books—all of whom have been glo
            rified in its pages—should alone be sufficiently numerous, as we 
            take for granted they are sufficiently grateful, to prevent a necessity so humiliating to themselves and their organ. It has certainly 
            done its duty—and, perhaps, something more than its duty—by all 
            this class of persons; and there must be something wrong in the 
            system by which it works, if, after all, it is compelled to look abroad, 
            to regions for whose cash alone it seems to care, for the miserable
            support which is necessary to its prolonged existence. Had it but 
            as religiously performed its duty by the whole broad country, the 
            name of which it modestly appropriates to itself—had it regarded 
            the nation, east and west, north and south, with an equal eye to its 
            glory, progress and advancement—we cannot think that its condition would be so greatly straitened now. That it has not done 
            so, is one of those unpleasant convictions in the public mind, to 
            which, without too great a stretch of inference, we may ascribe the 
            pregnant necessity which has led to the issue of the present circular. 
            With a little perversion of the text of Shakspeare, the mournful 
            speech of Wolsey to Cromwell, in the day of his decline, would 
            admirably suit the editor of the North American.—

            <br></br>Oh! Otis, Olis— 
            
            <br></br>Had I but served my country with the zeal 
            
            <br></br>I served my state, it would not in mine age, 
            
            <br></br>Have left me naked to mine enemies.”
         </div>
         
         
         <p>The publishers proceed:—"The tone of the work has become 
            somewhat bolder of late—and some energetic essays on general 
            politics have appeared in it.” This is certainly a very extraordinary 
            assurance, and should be productive of very general satisfaction 
            among its readers. We must not now be startled at any thing that
            may appear in these pages, for there is to be an infusion of new 
            blood into the old veins; not that we are to suppose, (for how 
            could this be, in the veteran service of this Journal for nearly thirty 
            years, in representing the taste, science, and literature of the 
            country—under such men, too, as Channing, and Everett, and 
            Sparks, and Palfrey,) that it ever was deficient in the necessary
            courage and energy of a periodical. But, us “veteran journals,” 
            like veteran soldiers, are apt to lapse into feebleness with years, it 
            is thought advisable to show, that such cannot be the case with 
            our "North American,” which draws from a perennial fountain, 
            and can exhibit, whenever the thing is necessary, quite as much of 
            the proper fluid, the genuine red blood, as will suffice, not only for 
            all periodical, but all mortal purposes. To the good old names of 
            Channing, the Everetts, Bancroft and Sparks, Story, Wheaton and 
            Prescott, there succeed others, of whom, as worthy to wear the 
            mantles which these have cast aside, we have liberal assurance— 
            though we hear, for the first time, of some of the persons named.
            There are, for example. "Mr. Peabody, of Springfield, and his 
            brother of Boston.” Peabody is a good name enough, particularly 
            to an agricultural country, though it reminds us irresistibly of one 
            of the personages in the "Midsummer Night’s Dream”—and we 
            catch ourselves quoting from Nicholas Bottom, at a rate which
            scarcely seems appropriate in dealing with a reviewer.—"I pray 
            you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother; and to master Peascod, your father. Good Master Pease-blossom, I shall desire of you more acquaintance.” We shall certainly hope to know 
            more of the Peabodys, both of Boston and Springfield. And there 
            is" Mr. Sabine, of Eastport.” We should be more satisfied of his 
            catholic tendencies were he written down, "Mr. Eastport, of Sabine,” but "Sessa—let it pass!” Here is the very curse of this review. It is New England only and all over—nothing but New
            England. Of all the contributors enumerated by the editor, in his 
            laudable desire to attract subscribers to his list from all the States 
            of the American confederacy, he mentions but one name—that of 
            Mr. Win. B. Read, of Philadelphia—which is not absolutely and 
            entirely New England. There is not a single New-Yorker, not a 
            Virginian, not a Marylander, not a Carolinian, Kentuckian, or Tennesseean in the catalogue. This is surely a strange way to bait
            for subscribers in other States, and bet ays, quite as strongly as any 
            thing can do, the miserable selfishness of that policy, so notorious of 
            New England, which, even when its object is to find favor abroad, 
            overlooks the most obvious method of doing so, in the slavish blindness of its early training. Surely, it is not pretended that good men 
            and true—able writers, profound and elegant thinkers—are not to 
            be found in all that stretch of country which has the Atlantic for 
            its base, from Long Island to the western limits of Georgia. But
            no! this "North American Review” is a neat contrivance for teach
            ing North America by means of New England. It is to embody 
            and spread abroad the tastes and the fashions, the philosophies 
            and the bigotries, of a trim little group, squat, complacent, that sits, 
            unquestioning and utterly unquestioned, in all the suavity of assumed 
            authority, within the colossal shadow of the Bunker Monument. 
            Undoubtedly, these are all either able or clever men—correct writers generally, knowing and circumspect—not so remarkable for 
            the profundity of their philosophy, as for their familiarity with the 
            received modes of thinking, and the pleasant graces of expression. 
            Their writers are usually fastidious gentlemen, rather more solicitous of style than of more important matters, and apt to write so 
            very like one another, that it will be somewhat difficult for one, not 
            accustomed to note the various degrees in which they severally 
            exhibit their energies, to detect the difference between them.
            They will give you, most generally, a well written article, which 
            will show you the absolute position of the question—where it was 
            in the time of Noah, what changes were effected by the policy of 
            Solomon, how, and by whose hands it came down to us, and where 
            it is at the present moment in New England. But, unhappily, they 
            will try to keep it in this position, till the Hood of events sweeps 
            over it, and them, rooting up their neat little landmarks, accurately 
            cut and chiselled, to drift away upon the broad waste of ocean, for 
            the curiosity and edification of each future Columbus of philosophy. 
            This tenacity of position, in their mental concerns, being the fruit 
            of certain inherent qualities of their blood, and a certain regimen 
            of which they make much, and which they call conservatism. Of
            this conservatism we shall know more hereafter.
         </p>
         
         <p>We do not know that the middle States have fared very much 
            better than those of the South, in the treatment which they have 
            received at the hands of this journal. Their favorite writers are 
            not employed upon its pages, and their publications are noticed 
            slowly and with evident reluctance. When reviewed, it is very 
            certain that the New England critic employs in the case of the 
            New-Yorker, a very different and less indulgent standard of judgment than that which regulates his criticism when one of his own 
            writers is under analysis. Procrustes was not more inexorable in 
            the use of his bedstead when the limbs of the stranger were to be
            adjusted—while, in the case of a native, his excesses are gently intimated, and what he has good about him—whatever is simply correct and inoffensive proves the occasion for as much delighted
            cackling as is made by an old hen, suddenly put in possession of 
            a nest egg which she never laid herself.
         </p>
         
         <p>Thus it is, that, with all the finish and polish of Boston —in spite 
            of the phrase on which the New Englander so much insists, when 
            he speaks of that city—"the Athens of America,” is immeasurably behind New-York in the measure and value of its literary productions. It is from New-York, with all its deficiencies of taste, 
            its rough-and-tumble enthusiasm—blundering constantly against 
            the proprieties—provoking constantly the sneer of our polished
            gentlemen down east—that we have the greatest amount of literary 
            performance. Here we have Cooper and Irving; and Bryant and 
            Halleck; and Hoffman and Willis; and Paulding and Herbert— 
            and many more, who will give us, and who have given us, works, 
            with which your Fadladeens, no doubt, will make sad havoc with 
            thumb and fore finger, but which said works will be read, and read 
            with delight, long after the critic by whom they were made mincemeat of, will be famishing upon his circulars.
         </p>
         
         <p>Much of this is true and well said, and much is untrue 
            and badly said. The New York names which are quoted as 
            evidence of the superior literary pretensions of this city over 
            Boston, were unhappily selected, three of them, Halleck,
            Willis, and Bryant are New Englanders of New England, 
            and Mr. Herbert is an old Englander, but a short time a resident of this country, and a good part of the time a resident 
            in Pennsylvania; as to Mr. Irving, there is as little of the 
            ‘‘rough and tumble enthusiasm” about him as any other 
            man possesses who ever blotted paper. New Englanders, 
            do, indeed, possess this very quality of rough-and-tumble enthusiasm in a greater degree than the writers of any other 
            portion of the country. Instead of writing with the fear of 
            the North American before them, their great defect has been 
            to write without any fear of any review whatever. As an 
            offset to Cooper, Irving, and Hoffman, the New Englander 
            may point with great complacency to Percival, Hawthorne, 
            R. W. Emerson, Channing, John Neal, Prescott, Brownson, 
            Lowell, Bancroft, Story, and Maria Child. These authors 
            owe nothing to the North American Review, the Review
            nothing to them. Their style is as dissimilar as though 
            they had been reared in different hemispheres.
         </p>
         
         <p>The truth is that the North American is held in as little 
            reverence in Boston as in South Carolina—probably it is not 
            held in as much. The tremendous onslaught of Mr. Simms’ 
            article upon the poor old decrepit Quarterly magazine, which
            exercises much less influence in the New England mind than 
            many penny papers do, shows how highly it is estimated at 
            the South.
         </p>
         
         <p>It has had its day, as nearly every other quarterly review 
            has; and but for this attack in the Southern Magazine, we 
            should never have been reminded of its existence. It seems 
            to have been given over to the new school of Whipple
            critics who are fast rocking it to an eternal slumber. The 
            article on the British Poets, was an unmistakable sign that 
            the breath was fast leaving its body. We would recommend the publishers to buy up the whole edition of the Southern magazine for gratuitous distribution: it is a capital
            puff, and will remind many of its old friends that the Review 
            is still in existence.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is certainly great truth in the following remarks, 
            but we do not see that any quarterly review could do any better. What the literary interests of the country need, is an 
            able weekly review, somewhat of the character of the London Athenaeum and the Literary Gazette; a deficiency in our
            periodical literature which we hope to fill by our Journal.
         </p>
         
         <p>The substantial particular in which this Review might have been 
            equally national and useful to this country,—much more so, indeed, 
            than by vainly attempting to combat the assaults and refute the 
            calumnies of foreign journals,—is in the countenance, the encouragement, and the assistance, which it might have shown to the immature genius of the country, struggling to give proper utterance to 
            its crude conceptions,—struggling here and there, in the cities and 
            the forest, under the thousand discouragements and disadvantages 
            which every where, in the great interior, beset the footsteps of the 
            infant intellect. But we have not seen, in the pages of this journal, a single instance where it has shown the slightest solicitude in 
            behalf of any young writer,—always assuming that he is not a sprout 
            of New England,—detecting his genius through its rags, and seeking, by gentle reproof and benignant counsel, to train it in the way 
            it should go, in the pursuit of its high calling. We see no young
            beginner taken by the hand, his course and models suggested, and 
            patient efforts made to give the true direction to his vague and imperfect conceptions. Where is the youth, whose first attempts have 
            signified the possessions of his mind, upon whom, at first, this journal has bestowed any of that notice which brings encouragement? 
            If one of these can be indicated, who has afterwards arrived at excellence and fame, we shall make such admissions in the case of 
            this “veteran periodical,” as we have not been prepared to make 
            before. And this is no improper test for a journal that boasts of
            its being the organ of the nation for thirty years. How can that 
            critic claim to have fostered the native literature, who cannot in a 
            single instance, point to the verification of his own predictions,— 
            who cannot point to some one individual whom he has designated 
            in the first blush of authorship, and urged with kind suggestion and 
            just counsel, to the attainment of an honourable eminence? Such
            should be no unreasonable requisition in the case of a veteran periodical like this; and one instance of this sort, honestly proven, 
            would be of more avail in adding to the subscription list, than ten 
            thousand self-complacent assurances of merit, embodied in a begging 
            Circular.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the matter of North and South, we claim to be perfectly disinterested spectators. It is quite impossible that 
            men who have never travelled should be able to entertain a 
            very comprehensive patriotism, particularly in a country like 
            ours whose borders are so widely extended. There are many
            kind-hearted people who are all alive to hear something 
            from the moon by means of Lord Rosse’s telescope, who will 
            sit down in happy ignorance of the opposite side of the town 
            in which they live. It is hardly credible but it is true, that
            the people who live West of Broadway, affect an utter ignorance of the territory lying east of the Bowery. We heard a 
            stranger inquire of a New Yorker, a Knickerbocker of the 
            Knickerbockers, the other day the way to Eldridge street— 
            “’Pon my word,” said the Knickerbocker patriot, "I cannot 
            tell you, I believe there is such a street, but I think it must lie 
            east of Broadway, for I have never seen it.” A great country 
            is like a great city—one half of the inhabitants must be strangers and enemies to the other half. The Southern Magazine 
            laughs incredulously at the mention of “Mr Sabine of Eastport,” and thinks that it should read Mr. Eastport of Sabine; 
            but the North American is equally incredulous in respect to 
            Stephen Elliot of Charleston, whom the Southern Magazine 
            speaks of in a tone which implies that not to know Stephen, 
            argues one's self unknown. Now we were born at the North, 
            but have lived at the South, and have wandered over a good 
            portion of the east and the west; our affections, are, therefore, 
            pretty equally quartered, and it has always been a matter of 
            astonishment to us that the different sections of the Union 
            should quarrel with each other, when we knew by observation that they were all very much alike. Railroads and 
            steamboats are doing something, and the electric telegraph 
            is doing more towards annihilating space and bringing all the
            inhabitants of the Union in close proximity to each other; and this will have the effect of allaying many unpleasant jealousies and suspicions which now exist between sections remote from each other. This very article in
            the Southern Magazine, chuckles over its chivalry to the fair sex like a cock
            in a barnyard, and so blesses itself that they do not murder women at the South as
            they do at the North. What the Magazine means by this insinuation we cannot
            possibly conceive: whether it has been reading Miss Fuller’s book, or some
            wicked wag has circulated a report down South that they have suttees in the Bay
            State, we do not know, but it is very evident that some of the literary
            circles in Charleston, have discovered a mare’s nest. We once heard a literary Carolinian say very seriously, in a company of learned men at the North, that there were no classical scholars in this country except at
            the South—and he said it in a manner, too, that left no doubt that he believed
            what he said. The same liberal gentleman also asserted very positively that
            there was no such thing as humor at the North. Now it so happens that the few
            humorous editors of whom they can boast at the South, are all New Englanders — Fields of the Reveille, and the Picayune people, being the most eminent among them. In New York, nearly the entire press is in the
            hands of New Englanders, Bryant of the Post, Willis and Morris of the Mirror, the
            Townsends and Brookses (a score of them) of the Express, Greely and Fuller of the Tribune, Hunt of the Merchant’s Magazine, Colton of
            the Whig Review, Hale and Hillock of the Journal of Commerce, Raymond and Daniels
            and King of the Courier, Cheever of the Evangelist, Morse of the Observer,
            Seabury of the Churchman, Beach of the Sun, Green, Deming &amp; Co. of the
            Emporium, Park Benjamin of something to be brought out by-and-by, and a dozen more
            of less prominence. Even the editor of the Southern Quarterly Review is a New
            Englander.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>For our own part, we think it a matter of precious little mo-: ment on which side
            of Mason and Dixon’s line a man is born if he is only a man “for a’that.” A few
            years ago when Mr. Webster attended a mass meeting in Richmond, the people were greatly astonished to find him so nearly resembling one of themselves, and we have no doubt that McDuffie or Calhoun would create the same kind of astonishment in Boston or Bangor. A gentleman, Mr. Tyler we believe, recommended, in a speech before some historical society in Philadelphia a year or two since, that a certain number of citizens
            should be sent over to England yearly, upon a reciprocal mission, to preserve peace between the two nations by the amenity of their manners. This was a
            very sensible recommendation, but we do not remember that any member of
            Congress has ever made any motion in relation to it. But it would be one of the
            cheapest and most agreeable methods of preserving the peaceable relations of
            England and America that could be devised. Our array and navy which are now kept up as scare-crows, and invite rather than repel invasion, cost
            the nation some fifteen millions annually. But ten millions would defray the annual
            expenses of at least thirty-five hundred gentlemen in the best London Society, and
            the peace-compelling effect of their intercourse with John Bull, more
            especially if they were single, no one can doubt would be much greater than our
            whole armed force now can produce, and the nation would be a clear gainer of some
            five millions of dollars which might be profitably expended in promotion of
            the same end, in founding public libraries, or erecting telegraphs and
            observatories. Some discretion would be necessary in the selection of these
            travelling peace makers and promoters of national good-will, but if they were
            elected by the people, in the manner of our representatives, there would be
            little danger of improper persons being sent. The same system might be adopted by the States with reference to each other, but on a much smaller scale
            and at a less expense.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The experiment tried by Massachusetts in sending old Mr. Hoar and his young daughter to South Carolina, did not turnout very well it must be
            confessed, but that is no reason why the experiment should not he tried again on a more extensive scale, or it might be well to try the plan upon a less
            belligerent people. North Carolina, for instance, as a test. We are not
            without hope that some spirited member of the next Congress will propose some
            measure like this that we have hinted at, and the inducement to good behavior in
            our citizens who might be ambitious of being sent abroad by the people would
            alone have the happiest tendency. Imagine the sensation that would be created in
            our fashionable
            
            squares and avenues by an announcement that one of Her Majesty’s steamers was
            below, freighted with two or three hundred of the elite of young England sent over here to promote good feeling towards the mother country! Would even
            Mr. Benton, or the tremendously war-like Senator from Ohio, ever dream of war
            after such an announcement?

         <div class="head">THE THREE MAXIMS.</div>
         
         <div class="ab">From the Gesta Romanorum.</div>
         
         <p>There was an emperor of Rome named Domitian, a good and a wise prince, who
            suffered no offenders to escape. There was a high feast in his hall, the tables
            glittered with gold and silver, and groaned with plenteous provision: his
            nobles feasted with him—
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <br></br>‘ And’twas merry with all
            
            <br></br>In the king’s great hall.
            
            <br></br>When his nobles and kinsmen, great and small,
            
            <br></br>Were keeping their Christmas holiday.’
            
         </div>
         
         <p>The porter in his lodge made his fire blaze brightly, and solaced
            himself with Christmas cheer; every now and then grumbling at his office, that kept
            him from the gaieties of the retainer’s hall. The wind blew cold, the sleet fell
            quick, as the bell of the king’s gate sounded heavy and dull. "Who comes
            now?” grumbled the porter; "a pretty night to turn out from fire and food. Why,
            the very bell itself finds it too cold to clank loudly. Well, well—duty is duty:
            some says it’s a pleasure—humph! Hilloa, friend, who are you? what do you
            want, man?”
         </p>
         
         <p>The traveller whom the porter thus addressed was a tall, weather-beaten man, with
            long white hair that fluttered from beneath his cap of furs, and whose figure,
            naturally tall and robust, seemed taller and larger from the vast cloak of
            bearskins with which he was enveloped.
         </p>
         
         <p>“I am a merchant from a far country,” said the man; “many wonderful things do I
            bring to your emperor, if he will purchase of my valuables.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Well, come in, come in, man,” said the porter: “the king keeps high Christmas
            feast, and on this night all men may seek his presence. Wilt take some refreshment,
            good sir?” 
         </p>
         
         <p>"I am never hungry, nor thirsty, nor cold.” </p>
         
         <p>"I’m all—there—straight before you, good sir—the hall porter will usher you
            in—straight before,” muttered the old porter, as he returned to his fire and his
            supper. “Never hungry, thirsty, nor cold—what a good poor man he would make! humph! he loses many a pleasure though,” continued the porter, as he
            closed the door of the lodge.
         </p>
         
         <p>The strange merchant presented himself to the hall porter, and was ushered by him
            into
            the presence of the emperor.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Who have we here?” said Domitian, as the strange visiter made his obeisance. "What
            seekest thou of me?”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I bring many things from far countries. Wilt thou buy of my curiosities?”</p>
         
         <p>"Let us see them,” rejoined Domitian.</p>
         
         <p>"I have three maxims of especial wisdom and excellence, my lord.”</p>
         
         <p>"Let us hear them.”</p>
         
         <p>"Nay, my lord; if thou hearest them, and likest not, then I have lost both my maxims
            and my money.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"And if I pay without hearing them, and they are useless, I lose my time and my money.
            What is the price?”
         </p>
         
         <p>" A thousand florins, my lord.”</p>
         
         <p>"A thousand florins for that of the which I know not what it is,” replied the
            king.
         </p>
         
         <p>"My lord,” rejoined the merchant, "if the maxims do not stand you in good stead, I
            will return the money.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Be it so then: let us hear your maxims."</p>
         
         <p>“The first, my lord,on this wise: Never begin anything UNTIL YOU HAVE CALCULATED WHAT
            THE END WILL BE.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I like your maxim much,” said the king; "let it be recorded in
            the chronicles of the kingdom, inscribed on the walls and over the doors of my
            palaces and halls of justice, and interwoven on the borders of the linen of my
            table and my chamber.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“The second, my Lord, is, Never leave a highway for A BYE-WAY.”</p>
         
         <p>" I see not the value of this maxim: but to the third.”</p>
         
         <p>"Never sleep in the house where the master is an old man and the wife a young
            woman. These three maxims, if attended to, my lord, will stand you in good
            stead.”
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p>“We shall see,” said the king; "a year and a day for the trial of each, at the
            end of this time we will settle accounts.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Good master,” said the king's jester, “wilt sell thy chance of the thousand
            florins for my fool’s cap?”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Wait, and see what the end will he,” rejoined the merchant; "a
            year and a day hence I will return to see how my first maxim has fared. Farewell,
            my lord.’’ . . .
         </p>
         
         <p>The year and a day were nearly elapsed, and yet the first maxim had not been
            clearly proved. Domitian remained severely just, and the ill-intentioned of his
            nobles plotted his destruction in the hopes of indulging their vices more freely
            under the rule of his successor. Many were the plots they concocted to put him
            to death, but all were foiled by his foresight and prudence.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Every failure,” said the conspirators at a midnight meet- ing, "brings danger nearer
            to ourselves.” 
         </p>
         
         <p>“Even so, brothers, but this time we will not fail,” said one of the number; "do
            ye not mind that I am the king’s barber: every day he bares his throat to my razor:
            it is but one slash, and we are free; promise me the crown: in return for this, I will give you freedom by the king’s death, and free license
            during my reign.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"It is well spoken,” cried all the conspirators; “the bar- ber shall be our king.”
            
         </p>
         
         <p>On the next morning, the barber entered the chamber of Domitian, and prepared to
            shave the king. The razor was stropped, the lather spread upon the royal chin, and the towel fastened round the royal breast. On the edge of the napkin were these words in letters of gold, "Never begin anything until you have calculated what the end will be.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The barber’s eye fell on these words, they arrested his attention, he paused in his
            labors. 
         </p>
         
         <p>“What am I about to do?" thought he to himself, “to kill the king, to gain his
            crown; am I sure of the crown? shall I not rather be slain miserably, and die amid
            unheard of tortures and infamy? whilst those that plot with me will turn
            against me, and make me their scape-goat.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Art dreaming, sir barber?” exclaimed the king. </p>
         
         <p>At the king's voice, the barber trembled exceedingly, he dropt the razor from his
            hand, and fell at his sovereign’s feet.
         </p>
         
         <p>"What means all this? </p>
         
         <p>“Oh, my good lord!” exclaimed the barber, as he knelt at Domitian’s feet, "this
            day was I to have killed thee: but I saw the maxim written on the napkin: I thought
            of the consequences, and now repent me of my wickedness. Mercy, my good lord,
            mercy!"
         </p>
         
         <p>“Be faithful, and fear not,” replied the king. </p>
         
         <p>“The merchant, my lord the king,’ said a servant of the chamber, who entered at
            that moment, followed by the old merchant.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Thou art come at a good time, sir merchant; the first maxim has been proved; it has saved my life: it was worthy of its price.”</p>
         
         <p>"Even as I expected, my lord—a year and a day hence expect me again.” </p>
         
         <p>"We will trust no more to a single hand,” said one of the conspirators, when they met again, after the barber’s repentance; "this time we will all
            share.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I propose,’ said one of the rebel lords, "an ambush on the road to Naples.
            Every year, on the day after Christmas, the king journeys thither; the bye-path
            near to the city gates is the nearest road, peradventure he will go that way.’’
         </p>
         
         
         <p>When the Christmas night was over, the king prepared to journey to Naples; a
            great company of nobles, knights, and men at arms, went with him. Not far from the
            city, he came to the place where the highway and bye path diverged.
         </p>
         
         <p>"My lord,” said an old noble, "the day is far spent, the sun sinks fast in the
            horizon; will not my lord turn by the bye-path, as it is far shorter than the high
            road?”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Nay,” said the king, “it’s a year and a day since the merchant's first maxim
            saved my life: now will I test the second admonition. ‘ Never leave a highway for a
            bye-path,' but go part of ye by that path, and prepare for me in the city; I
            and the rest will pursue the highway.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Onward rode the knights and the soldiers by the bye-path, and hastened towards the
            city; as they neared the ambush, the traitors sprang upon them, for they thought
            the king was among them. Every man slew his opponent, and there remained not one of the king's company, to bear the tidings to the king, but a youth, a little page, whom the conspirators did not remark during the
            attack.
         </p>
         
         <p>At the city gates, the king found the merchant who had sold him his maxims.</p>
         
         <p>"Halt, O king!” said he—the second maxim has been proved.”</p>
         
         <p>“How so?” replied the king.</p>
         
         <p>“The company that rode by the bye-path are slain, every one of them save this
            little page, who is here to tell the sad tale.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Is this so, good youth?”</p>
         
         <p>“Alas, my lord, it is too true: from behind the trees they rushed upon our
            company as we rode lightly and merrily, and no one, save your poor page, lives to
            tell the tale.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"For a second time is my life saved by the maxim; let it be inscribed in gold, ‘ Never leave a highway for a byeway.'”</p>
         
         <p>"For a year and a day, O king, fare thee well.”</p>
         
         <p>"A murrain on the old fool’s maxims!” grumbled the chief of the conspirators,
            when they discovered that the king had escaped their wicked design; "we are
            beaten out of every plot, and had best submit to his dominion.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"Nay,” exclaimed a young and icentious noble, "there is luck in odd numbers, let
            us have one more trial, a sink or a swim.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I care not if we try once more,” said the old rebel; "but come, who suggests a
            scheme?”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I, and I, and I!” exclaimed several at once; but their schemes were pronounced
            futile.
         </p>
         
         <p>"What say ye to this?” said the young man who had before spoken: "every year
            the king goes to the small village town, where his old nurse lives; there is but one house in the village where he can be lodged, let us bribe the
            master of the house, that he slay our tyrant while he sleeps.”
         </p>
         
         <p>!he plan was approved by the rebel lords, the bribe offered and
            accepted by the old man, to whose house the king always came. The king came as
            usual to the village town, and to his old lodgings. As he entered, the old man
            received him with humility and feigned delight, and a young damsel, not
            eighteen, attended at the door step. The king noticed the damsel, he arrested his
            steps, and called to the old man.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Good father,’’asked he, "is yonder damsel thy daughter, or thy niece?”</p>
         
         <p>“Neither, my lord,” replied the old man, “she is my newly-married wife.”</p>
         
         <p>"Away, away,” said the king to his chamberlain, “prepare me a bed in another house, for I will not sleep here tonight.”</p>
         
         <p>“Even as my lord wishes,” rejoined the chamberlain; “but my lord knows there is no
            other house in this place fit for a king’s residence, save this one; here everything is prepared, everything commodious.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"I have spoken,” replied the king: “remain thou here; I will sleep elsewhere.”</p>
         
         <p>In the night, the old man and his wife arose, stole on tiptoe to the
            chamber which was prepared for the king, and where the chamberlain now slept in the
            royal bed; all was dark as they approached the bed, and plunged a dagger into
            the breast of the sleeping noble.
         </p>
         
         <p>"It is done,” said they; "to bed, to bed.” </p>
         
         <p>Early the next morning, the king’s page knocked at the door of the humble abode
            where the king had passed the night.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Why so early, good page?” asked the king.</p>
         
         <p>“My lord, the old merchant waits thy rising; and even now strange news is come from
            the
            village.’’
         </p>
         
         <p>"Let the merchant and the messenger come in.” </p>
         
         <p>The merchant seemed greatly elated, his eye glistened with joy, and his figure
            appeared dilated beyond its ordinary height. The messenger was pale and trembling,
            and staring aghast with fear.
         </p>
         
         <p>"My lord, my good lord,” exclaimed the pallid messenger, "a horrible murder has been committed on your chamberlain: he lies dead in the royal
            bed.”
         </p>
         
         <p>"The third maxim is tried and proved," said the merchant. </p>
         
         <p>“Give God the praise,” said the king; “thy reward is earned: a robe of honor, and
            thrice thy bargained price; to the old man and his wife, immediate death.”

            <br></br>In the purple time and olden,
            
            <br></br>When the East was growing grey;
            
            <br></br>When the mists were star-ward creeping—
            
            <br></br>Weeping—being woke from sleeping
            
            <br></br>By the anthems of the Day;—
            
            <br></br>While, like vapor o’er a city, fluctuating still they lay;
            
            
            <br></br>Walking through their shrouding shadows,
            
            <br></br>Over daisy-dimpled meadows,
            
            <br></br>Moved a proud and princely youth,
            
            <br></br>With a foot-fall light and airy
            
            <br></br>As the sylphid step of fairy,
            
            <br></br>And a forehead stamped with truth:—
            
            <br></br>An Apollo! incarnating lofty scorn and living ruth.
            
            
            <br></br>From the valley,—from a river,—
            
            <br></br>Which, with many a silver quiver,
            
            <br></br>Through the landscape stole in light;—
            
            <br></br>From the bushes, shrubs, and blossoms,—
            
            <br></br>Flowers unfolding fragrant bosoms,—
            
            <br></br>Curled the shadows out of sight;
            
            <br></br>Fading, like a ghost, in air. 
            
            <br></br>And ever the river rippled bright.
            
            
            <br></br>Fruits of crimson—purple—azure—
            
            <br></br>Thrilled his Poet-soul with pleasure
            
            <br></br>Which, from all, new glory won;
            
            <br></br>While around him birds were chaunting,—
            
            <br></br>Birds that fairy valley haunting,—
            
            <br></br>Such as Mother Earth had none:
            
            <br></br>And like gems their pinious glistened, glancing in the aspiring sun.
            
            
            <br></br>In a sweet excitement swimming,
            
            <br></br>All his soul with beauty brimming,
            
            <br></br>While the morning grew to noon;
            
            <br></br>In that glorious valley—listening
            
            <br></br>To the music—by the glistening
            
            <br></br>River—sung with lulling tune,
            
            <br></br>While his heart throbbed echo 'neath Lethean languor born 
            
            <br></br>of June—
            
            
            <br></br>Carelessly the youth went straying
            
            <br></br>Like a merry child a-Maying.
            
            <br></br>And the river rippled on.
            
            <br></br>While now that a hirst pursued him,
            
            <br></br>And the noon tide heat subdued him,
            
            <br></br>And he felt him weak and wan,
            
            <br></br>Thinking of the stream, he turned him, fevered; but the stream was gone!
            
            
            <br></br>Searching for it, on he wandered
            
            <br></br>Hour by hour! and sadly pondered
            
            <br></br>As to where its waves might be:
            
            <br></br>And the valley slowly faded
            
            <br></br>To a primal forest, shaded
            
            <br></br>By full many a mossy tree.
            
            <br></br>Still he could not see the stream meandering through the meadowy lea.
            
            
            <br></br>But the murmur of the river,
            
            <br></br>Rippling, miming, plashing ever,
            
            <br></br>Floated on his yearning ear:
            
            <br></br>Still before he heard it flowing—
            
            <br></br>Heard it kiss the rocks while going,
            
            <br></br>Seeming us he heard it, near;
            
            <br></br>Whispering nearer, flowing onward, gurgling every instant hear.
            
            
            <br></br>More luxuriant, greener, brighter,
            
            <br></br>Glossier, loftier, aud lighter
            
            <br></br>Grew the foliage where it seemed:
            
            <br></br>And the woodland birds sang clearer,
            
            <br></br>And the waters near and nearer
            
            <br></br>Murmured, 'till he thought they gleamed;
            
            <br></br>And, between the emerald leaves, he dreamed the silver wavelets beamed:
            
            
            
            <br></br>Through the trees, among the bushes,
            
            <br></br>Looking for the river rushes,
            
            <br></br>Onward, onward, still he went,
            
            <br></br>Listening to the water’s plashing—
            
            <br></br>Listening to the eddies dashing
            
            <br></br>In their chrystal merriment:
            
            <br></br>But he found it not, though stooping—gazing 'till his form grew 
            bent.
            
            
            <br></br>All around grew dark and dreary,
            
            <br></br>And our wanderer, very weary,
            
            <br></br>Tottered feebly, full of pain,
            
            <br></br>From the forest; with his figure
            
            <br></br>Robbed of all its youthful vigor:—
            
            <br></br>And the sun was on the wane—
            
            <br></br>And night’s swarthy, solemn shadow slowly gathered round the 
            plain,
            
            
            <br></br>And—among those shades lamenting,—
            
            <br></br>Urged by old Time unrelenting,—
            
            <br></br>Where was never else but gloom—
            
            <br></br>From the sight the wanderer faded,
            
            <br></br>By chaotic blackness shaded.
            
            <br></br>While the silence of the tomb
            
            <br></br>Wrapped him, shroud-like; and that silence was the requiem 
            of his doom.

         <p>Ye who read are still among the living: but I who write shall have long since gone my wav into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things shall
            happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass away, ere
            these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be some to
            disbelieve, and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in
            the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.

         <p>The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense than terror for
            which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and signs had taken
            place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and
            to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the
            alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance
            of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the terrible
            Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself
            manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls,
            imaginations, and meditations of mankind.
         </p>
         
         <p>Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble ball, in a dim
            city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. And to our chamber
            there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was
            fashioned by the artizan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise, in the
            gloomy room, shut cut from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless
            streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be so excluded.
            There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account —things material and spiritual—heaviness in the
            atmosphere—a sense of suffocation—anxiety— and, above all, that terrible state of
            existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and
            awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung
            upon us. It hung upon our limbs— upon the household furniture—upon the goblets from
            which  we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down  thereby—all
            things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel.
            Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all
            pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the
            round table of ebony at which we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of
            his companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our pro
            per way—which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which are madness; and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us
            of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young
            Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded;—the genius and the demon
            of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance,
            distorted with the plague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our
            merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But
            although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still I forced
            myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and, gazing down
            steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice
            the songs of the son of Teios. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo!
            from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there came
            forth a dark and undefined shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven,
            might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow
            neither of man, nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And, quivering awhile among
            the draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the
            door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor of God— neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon
            the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained.
            And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there
            assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies,
            dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually
            into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low
            words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow
            answered, "I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and
            hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian
            canal.” And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand
            trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones in the voice of the shadow
            were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying
            in their cadences from syllable to syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the
            well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends

            <div class="head">MRS. CHILD'S PHILOTHEA.</div>
            
            <p>Overwhelmed in a long-continued inundation of Sue-ism, we turn with a species of
               gasping satisfaction—with a deep sense of the luxury of repose—to the pure and
               quiet pages of Philothea.
            </p>
            
            <p>We regard it not only as the best work of its author—but as the best work of a class in which are to be ranked the Telemachus of Fenelon and the
               Anacharsis of Barthelemi.
            </p>
            
            <p>Its plot is simple. The scene is principally in ancient Athens during the
               administration of Pericles; and some of the chief personages of his time are
               brought, with himself, upon the stage. Among these are Aspasia, Alcibiades, Hippocrates, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, Plato, Hermippus the comic
               writer, Phidias the sculptor, Artaxerxes of Persia, and Xerxes his son.
               Philothea, the heroine of the tale, and the grand daughter of Anaxagoras, is of a
               majestic beauty, and of great purity and elevation of mind. Her friend Eudora,
               of a more delicate loveliness, and more flexile disposition, is the adopted
               daughter of Phidias, who bought her, when an infant, of a goat-herd in
               Phelle—herseif and nurse having been stolen from the Ionian coast by Greek
               pirates, the nurse sold into slavery, and the child delivered to the care of
               the goat-herd. The ladies, of course, have lovers. Eudorais betrothed
               to Philaemon. This Athenian, the son of the wealthy Cherilaus, but whose mother
               was bom in Corinth, has incurred the dislike of Aspasia, the wife of Pericles,
               She procures the revival of an ancient law subjecting to a heavy fine all
               citizens who marry foreigners, and declaring all persons whose parents were not both Athenians, incapable of voting in the public assemblies, or of
               inheriting the estates of their fathers. Philaemon, thus deprived of citizenship, prevented from holding office, and without hope of any
               patrimony, is obliged to postpone, indefinitely, his union with Eudora. The
               revival of the obnoxious law has also a disastrous effect on the interests of
               Philothea. She is beloved by Paralus, the son of Pericles, and returns his
               affection.
               But in marrying she will bring upon him losses and degradation. Pericles, too, looks with an evil eye upon her poverty; and the idea of marriage is therefore finally abandoned.

            <p>Matters are thus situated when Philothea, being appointed one of
               the Canephorae (whose duty it is to embroider the sacred peplus, and to carry
               baskets in the precession of the Panathenaia) is rigidly secluded by law, for six
               months, within the walls of the Acropolis. During this time Eudora, deprived of the good counsel and example of her friend, becomes a frequent
               visitor at the house of Aspasia, by whose pernicious influence she is insensibly
               affected. It is at the return of Philothea from the Acropolis that the story commences. At the urgent solicitation of Aspasia, who is desirous of strengthening her influence in Athens by the countenance of the virtuous, Anaxagoras is induced to attend, with his grand-daughter, a symposium at the house of Pericles. Eudora accompanies them.
               The other guests are Hermippus, Phidias, the Persian Artaphernes,
               Tithonus a learned Ethiopian, Plato, Hipparete the wife of Alcibiades, and Alcibiades himself. At this symposium Eudora is dazzled by the graces of Alcibiades, and listens to his seductive flattery—forgetful of the claims of Hipparete and of her own lover, Philaemon. The poison of this illicit feeling now affects all the action of the
               drama. Philothea discovers the danger of her friend, but is sternly repulsed upon
               the proffer of good advice. Alcibiades is appointed a secret interview by
               Eudora, which is interrupted by Philothea—not, however, before it is observed by
               Philaemon, who in consequence, abandons his mistress, and departs broken-hearted
               from Athens. The eyes of Eudora are now opened, too late, to the perfidy of
               Alcibiades, who had deceived her with the promise of marriage and of obtaining a divorce from Hipparete. It is Hipparete who appeals to the Archons for a divorce from Alcibiades, on the score of his notorious profligacy; and in the investigations which ensue, it appears that a snare has been laid by Aspasia and himself to entrap Eudora, and
               that, with a similar end in view, he has also promised marriage to Electra, the
               Corinthian.
            </p>
            
            <p>Pericles seeks to please the populace by diminishing the power of the Areopagus.
               He causes a decree to be passed, that those who deny the existence of the Gods,
               or introduce new opinions about celestial things, shall be tried by the
               people. This, however, proves injurious to some of his own personal friends.
               Hermippus lays before the Themothetae Archons an accusation of blasphemy against
               Anaxagoras, Phidias, and Aspasia; and the case is tried before the fourth
               assembly of the people. Anaxagoras is charged with not having offered victims to the Gods, and with having blasphemed the divine Phoebus
               by saying the sun was only a huge ball of fire:—he is condemned to die. Phidias is accused of blasphemy in having carved the likeness of himself
               and Pericles on the shield of heaven-born Pallas—of having
               said that he approved the worship of the Gods merely because he wished to have his own works adored—and of decoying to
               his own house the maids and matrons of Athens, under pretence of seeing
               sculpture, but in fact, to administer to the profligacy of Pericles. He also is
               sentenced to death. Aspasia is accused of saying that the sacred baskets of Demeter contained nothing of so much importance as the beautiful maidens who carried them; and that the temple of Poseidon was enriched with no offerings from those who had been
               wrecked notwithstanding their supplications—thereby implying irreverent doubts of
               the power of Ocean’s God. Her sentence is exile. Pericles, however, succeeds in
               getting the execution of the decrees suspended until the oracle of Amphiaraus can be consulted. Antiphon, a celebrated diviner, is
               appointed to consult it. He is absent for many days, and in the meantime Pericles
               has an opportunity of tampering with the people, as he has already tampered with Antiphon. The response of the oracle opportunely declares that
               the sentences be re-considered. They are; Phidias and Anaxagoras are merely
               banished, while Aspasia is acquitted. These trials form, perhaps, the most
               interesting portion of the book.
            </p>
            
            <p>Chapter XI. introduces us to Anaxagoras, the contented resident of a small
               village near Lampsacus in Ionia. He is old, feeble and poor. Philothea watches by
               his side, and supports him with the labor of her hands, Plato visits the
               sage of Clazomenae in his retreat, and brings news of the still beloved
               Athens. The pestilence is raging—the Piraeus is heaped with the unburied dead. Hipparete has fallen a victim. Pericles was one of the first sufferers, but has recovered through the skill of Hippocrates. Phidias who,
               after his sentence of exile, departed with Eudora to Elis, and grew in honor
               among the Eleans—is dead. Eudora still remains at his house, Elis having bestowed
               on her the yearly revenues of a farm in consideration of the affectionate care
               bestowed upon her illustrious benefactor. Philaemon is in Persia instructing the sons of the wealthy satrap Megabyzus. Alcibiades is living in unbridled license at Athens. But the visiter
               has not vet spoken of Paralus, the lover of Philothea.— "Daughter of Alcimenes,”
               he at length says—we copy here a page of the volume as a specimen of the grace of the narrative:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Daughter of Alcimenes, your heart reproaches me that I forbear to speak of Paralus. That I have done so, has not been from forgetfulness, but because I
               have with vain and self-defeating prudence sought for cheerful words to convey
               sad thoughts. Paralus breathes and moves, but is apparently unconscious of
               existence in this world. He is silent and abstracted, like one just returned from
               the cave of Troponius. Yet beautiful forms are ever with him in infinite variety; for his quiescent soul has now undisturbed recollection of the
               divine archetypes in the ideal world, of which all earthly beauty is the
               shadow.”
            </p>
            
            <p>" He is happy, then, though living in the midst of death,” an- swered Philothea. “
               But does his memory retain no traces of his friends?” 
            </p>
            
            <p>"One—and one only,” he replied. “The name of Philothea was too deeply engraven to be washed away by the waters of oblivion. He seldom speaks; but
               when he does you are ever in his visions. The sound of a female voice
               accompanying the lyre is the only thing that makes him smile; and nothing moves
               him to tears; save the farewell song of Orpheus to Eurydice. In his drawings
               there is more of majesty and beauty than Phydias or Myron ever conceived;
               and one figure is always there—the Pythia, the Muse, the Grace, or something
               combining all these, more spiritual than either.”
            </p>
            
            <p>The special object of Plato's visit is the hearing of a message
               from Pericles. Hippocrates has expressed a hope that the presence of Philothea
               may restore, in some measure, the health and understanding of Paralus, and the
               once ambi- tious father has sent to beg the maiden’s consent to a union with
               the now deeply afflicted son. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>"Philothea would not leave me even if I urged it with tears," replied Anaxagoras,
               “and I am forbidden to return to Athens.” 
            </p>
            
            <p>"Pericles has provided an asylum for you, on the borders of Attica,” answered Plato, “and the young people would soon join you after their
               marriage. He did not suppose that his former proud opposition to their loves
               would be forgotten; but he said hearts like yours would forgive it all, the more
               readily because he was now a man deprived of power, and his son suffering under a
               visitation of the gods. Alcibiades laughed aloud when he heard of this proposition; and said his uncle would never think of making it to
               any but a maiden who sees the zephyrs run, and hears the stars sing. He spoke truth in his profane merriment. Pericles knows that she who
               obediently listens to the inward voice, will be most likely to seek the happiness
               of others, forgetful of her own wrongs.”
            </p>
            
            <p>"I do not believe the tender hearted maiden ever cherished resentment against any living thing,” replied Anaxagoras. “She often reminds me
               of Hesiod’s description of Leto:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               
               <br></br>Placid to men and to immortal gods;
               
               <br></br>Mild from the first beginning of her days;
               
               <br></br>Gentlest of all in Heaven.
               
            </div>
            
            <p>She has indeed been a precious gift to my old age. Simple and loving as she is,
               there are times when her looks and words fill me with awe, as if I stood in the
               presence of divinity.”
            </p>
            
            <p>“It is a most lovely union when the Muses and the Gharitioe inhabit the same
               temple,” said Plato. "I think she learned of you to be a constant worshipper of
               the innocent and graceful nymphs, who preside over kind and gentle actions. But tell me, Anaxagoras, if this marriage is declined, who will protect
               the daughter of Aleimenes when you are gone?”
            </p>
            
            <p>The philosopher replied, "I have a sister, Helidora, the youngest of my
               father’s Rock, who is a Priestess of the Sun, at Ephesus.— Of all my family, she has least despised me for preferring philosophy to gold; and report bespeaks her wise and virtuous. I have asked and obtained from her a
               promise to protect Philothea when I am gone; but I will tell my child the wishes
               of Pericles, and leave her to the guidance of her own heart. If she enters the home of Paralus, she will be to him, as she has been to me, a bounty
               like the sunshine.”
            </p>
            
            <p>Philothea assents joyfully to the union, although Chrysippus, the
               wealthy prince of Clazomenae, has offered her his hand. Anaxagoras dies. His
               grand-daughter, attended by Plato and some female acquaintances, departs for
               Athens and arrives safely in the harbor of Phalerum. No important change has occurred in Paralus, who still hows a total unconsciousness of
               past events. The lovers however, are united. Many long passages about this portion of the narrative are of a lofty beauty. The dreamy, distraught, yet, unembittered existence of the husband, revelling in
               the visions of the Platonic philosophy—the anxiety of the father and his
               friends—the ardent, the pure and chivalric love, with the uncompromising devotion
               and soothing attentions of the wife—are pictures of which the rare merit will not
               fail to be appreciated by all whose opinion Mrs. Child would be likely to
               value.
            </p>
            
            <p>Hippocrates has been informed that Tithonus, the Ethiopian,
               possesses the power of leading the soul from the body, “by means of a soul
               dissecting wand,” and the idea arises that the process may produce a salutary
               effect upon Paralus. Tithonus will be present at the Olympian games, and thither the patient is conveyed, under charge of Pericles, Plato,
               and his wife. On the route to Corinth, a letter from Philaemon,
               addressed to Anaxagoras, is handed by Artaphernes the Persian, to Philothea. At
               the close of this letter the writer expresses a wish to be informed of Eudora’s
               fate, and an earnest hope that she is not beyond the reach of Philothea’s
               influence. The travellers finally stop at a small town in the neighborhood
               of Olympia, and at the residence of Proclus and his wife Melissa, “worthy
               simple-hearted people with whom Phidias had died, and under whose protection he
               had placed his adopted daughter.” The meeting between this maiden and
               Philothea is full of interest. The giddy heart of Eudora is chastened by sorrow.
               Phidias had designed her marriage with his nephew Pandoenus—but her first love is
               not yet forgotten. A letter is secretly written by Philothea to, Philaemon, acquainting him with the change in Eudora’s character, and with
               her unabated affection for himself,— 
            </p>
            
            <p>"Sometimes,” she writes,"a stream is polluted at the fountain and
               its waters are tainted through all its wanderings; and sometimes the traveller
               throws into a pure rivulet some unclean thing which floats awhile and then is
               rejected from its bosom. Eudora is the pure rivulet. A foreign stain floated
               on its surface, but never mingled with its waters.”
            </p>
            
            <p>The efforts of Tithonus are inadequate to the effectual relief of Paralus. We quote in full the account of the Ethiopian’s attempt. Mrs. Child is here, however, partially indebted to a statement by Clearchus, of an operation somewhat similar to that of Tithonus,
               performed either by the aid or in the presence of Aristotle. The subject has
               derived additional interest of late, from the manner in which it has been
               touched by Hare Townshend and Newnham.
            </p>
            
            <p>The relation of Clearchus mentions a diviner with a spirit drawing wand and a
               youth whose soul was thereby taken from the body, leaving it inanimate. The soul
               being replaced by the aid of the magician, the youth enters into a wild account
               of what befel him during the trance. The passage in “Philothea”
               runs thus:—
            </p>
            
            <p>Tithonus stood behind the invalid and remained perfectly quiet for many minutes.
               He then gently touched the back part of his head with a small wand, and leaning
               over him, whispered in his car. An unpleasant change immediately passed over the countenance of Paralus. He endeavored to place his hand on his head,
               and a cold shivering seized him. Philothea shuddered, and Pericles grew pale, as they watched these symptoms; but the silence remained
               unbroken. A second and a third time the Ethiopian touched him with his wand, and spoke in whispers. The expression of pain deepened; insomuch that
               his friends could not look upon him without anguish of heart. Finally his limbs straightened, and became perfectly rigid and motionless.
            </p>
            
            <p>Tithonus, perceiving the terror he had excited, said soothingly,
               "O Athenians, be not afraid. I have never seen the soul withdrawn without a struggle with the body. Believe me it will return. The
               words I whispered, were those I once heard from the lips of Plato. ‘ The human
               soul is guided by two horses—one white with a flowing mane, earnest eye, and
               wings like a swan, whereby he seeks to fly; but the other is black, heavy, and
               sleepy-eyed--ever prone to lie down upon the earth.’ The second time I whispered,
               ‘
               Lo, the soul seeketh to ascend!’ And the third lime I said, ‘Behold the winged
               separates from that which has no wings.’ When life returns, Paralus will have
               remembrance of these words.”
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, restore him! restore him!” exclaimed Philothea, in tones of agonised
               intreaty. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Tithonus answered with respectful tenderness, and again stood in profound
               silence several minutes, before he raised the wand. At the first touch, a feeble
               shivering gave indication of returning life. As it was repeated a second and a
               third lime, with a brief interval between each movement, the countenance of the
               sufferer grew more dark and troubled, until it became fearful to look upon.
               But the heavy shadow gradually passed away, and a dreamy smile returned like
               a gleam of sunshine after storms. The moment Philothea perceived an expression
               familiar to her heart, she knelt by the couch, seized the hand of Paralus, and
               bathed it with her tears.
            </p>
            
            <p>When the first gush of emotion had subsided, she said in a soft, low voice, “
               Where have you been, dear Paralus?” The invalid answered, “A thick vapor
               enveloped me, as with a dark cloud; and a stunning noise pained my head with its
               violence. A voice said to me, ‘ The human soul is guided by two horses; one
               white, with a flowing mane, earnest eyes, and wings like a swan, whereby he
               seeks lo fly; but the other is black, heavy, and sleepy-eyed— ever prone to lie
               down upon the earth.’ Then the darkness began to clear away. But there was
               strange confusion. All things seemed rapidly to interchange their colors and
               their forms—the sound of a storm was in mine ears—the elements and the stars
               seemed to crowd upon me—and my breath was taken away. Then I heard a voice
               saying, ‘ Lo, the soul seeketh to ascend!’ And I looked and saw the chariot and
               horses, of which the voice again said, ‘ Behold, the winged separates from that
               which hath no wings!’ And suddenly the chariot ascended, and I saw the white
               horse on light, fleecy clouds, in n far blue sky. Then I heard a pleasing
               silent sound—as if dew-drops made music as they fell. I breathed freely, and
               my form seemed to expand itself with buoyant life. All at once I was floating in the air above a quiet lake, where reposed seven beautiful islands, full of the sound of harps; and Philothea slept at my side, with a garland on
               her head. I asked, ‘ Is  this the divine home whence I departed into the
               body?’ And a voice above my head answered: It is the divine home. Man never
               leaves it. He ceases to perceive. Afterward I looked downward,
               and saw my dead body lying on a couch. Then again there came strange
               confusion—and a painful clashing of sounds—and all things rushing together. But
               Philothea look my hand and spoke to me in gentle tones, and the discord
               ceased.”
            </p>
            
            <p>The mind of Paralus derives but a temporary benefit from the skill of Tithonus,
               and even the attendance of the patient upon the Olympian games (a suggestion of
               Pericles) fails of the desired effect. A partial revival is indeed thus brought
               about—but death rapidly ensues. The friends of the deceased return to Athens, accompanied by the adopted daughter of Phidias.
               Philothea dies. Not many days after the funeral ceremonies, Eudora suddenly disappears. Alcibiades is suspected (justly) of having entrapped her
               to his summer residence in Salamis. The pages which follow this event detail
               the rescue of the maiden by the ingenuity of two faithful slaves—the discovery of her father in Artaphernes the Persian, whom she accompanies to the court of Artaxerxes—her joyful meeting there and marriage with Philaemon, after refusing the proffered hand of Xerxes himself.
            </p>
            
            <p>In regard to the species of novel of which "Philothea" is so fine a specimen,
               we may say that no powers can render it, at the present day, popular. Nor is the voice of the people, in this respect, to be adduced as any evidence of corrupted taste. We have little of purely human sympathy in the
               distantly antique; and what little we have is weakened by the necessity for effort in conceiving appropriateness in manners, habits, costume,
               and modes of thought, so widely at variance with those around us. The "Pompeii”
               of Bulwer cannot be considered as altogether belonging to the species, and
               fails in popularity only as it does so belong to it. This justly admired work
               owes what it possesses of attraction for the mass, to the stupendousness of its
               leading event—an event rendered only the more thrillingly interesting by the
               obscurity which years have thrown over its details—to the skill with which
               the mind of the reader is prepared for this event—to the vigor with which it is
               depicted—and to the commingling with this event human passions wildly affected
               thereby—passions the sternest of our nature and common to all character and
               lime. By means so effectual we are hurried over, and observe not, unless with a
               critical eye, those radical defects or difficulties (coincident with the
               choice of epoch) of which we have spoken above. The fine perception of Bulwer endured these difficulties as inseparable from the ground-work of his narrative—did not mistake them for facilities.
               The plot of"Philothea,” like that of the "Telemachus’’ and of the “
               Anarcharsts,” should be regarded, on the other hand, as merely the vehicle for
               the “antique manners, habits and modes of thought” which are at variance
               with a popular interest to-day. Regarding it in this, its only proper light, we
               are justified in speaking of the work as an honor to our country, and a triumph
               for our country-women.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Philothea” might be introduced, with advantage, into our female academies. Its
               purity of thought and elevation of tone are admirably adapted to scholastic
               purposes. It would prove an effectual aid in the study of Greek antiquity,
               with the spirit of which it is wonderfully imbued. We say wonderfully—for
               the authoress disclaims all knowledge of the classical tongues. There are some
               points, to be sure, at which a pedant might cavil—some perversions of the character of Pericles—of the philosophy of Anaxagoras—and there
               might be found more than one flaw in the arrangement of Aspasia’s symposium. On the other hand the work af
               fords evidence of an even intimate acquaintance with the genius of the
               times, places, and people depicted; and with the many egregious blunders of so fine a scholar as Barthelemi still fresh in our remembrance, it will
               never do to find fault with a few peccadilloes on the part of Mrs. Child. As
               a mere narrative, "Philothea” is, moreover, entitled to high praise, and its exceeding purity of style should especially recommend it to the
               attention of teachers.

            <div class="ab">NEW BOOKS, AND NEW EDITIONS. An Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy,
               comprising such subjects 
               <br></br>as are most immediately connected with house-keeping,
               &amp;c., &amp;c.-- 
               <br></br>Illustrated with nearly one thousand wood cuts. To be completed
               
               <br></br>in twelve numbers at 25 cents. Parts 1, 2, and 3. Harper and Bro- 
               <br></br>thers.
            </div>
            
            <p>This is unquestionably the most comprehensive work on the subject of
               Housekeeping, that has ever been undertaken since the days of Noah, and
               considering the great number of its illustrations, and their general excellence,
               it must be pronounced the cheapest. The first part is very properly devoted
               to architecture, the construction of a house being the first consideration
               towards house-keeping. The illustrations are mainly taken from Gwilt, one of the
               most reliable sources for architectural accuracy, with which we have any acquaintance. The publishers have very strangely introduced a view of Trinity church in this part, but for what reason we cannot possibly
               divine. There are plenty of domestic buildings in Downing’s two books, which
               would have given a much better idea of an American house than Trinity church. It
               is greatly to be regretted that in a work of this importance, a few pages
               and a few designs had not been given to American houses, types of which may be
               found in great abundance both in town and country. The view of Wallaton Hall is
               given without the central pile, which imparts to that remarkable building its chief characteristic; there is enough given, however, to
               enable those who have never seen it to form some idea of its picturesque beauty.
               The methods of warming and ventilating houses are peculiarly valuable. The
               second part is devoted mainly to artificial illumination, and the third, which is most profusely illustrated, to furniture, plate, and upholstery.
               Each part contains more than a hundred and twenty pages of closely printed matter
               in clear type, on handsome paper. Every man, when he takes a wife, should
               also procure a copy of this valuable Encyclopaedia.

            <p>There are two or three things about this edition of the great poet especially
               worthy of commendation, although there are others, which we shall point out next
               week, not to be passed over without reprehension. We particularly admire the illustrated corn, which is one of the best specimen’s of that kind
               of drawing which any of our publishers have put forth. The present number
               contains “As you Like it,” entire. The illustrations are very beautiful, well conceived, well drawn, and cut with great neatness and precision. The names of the artists should be given. One of the points
               which we particularly admire is the good taste of the editor in choosing the old and most correct manner of spelling Shakespeare's name.

            <p>It contains, indeed, so much of that kind of practical information
               which amateurs must acquire, either through some such aid, or through the more tedious path of their own individual experience, and at the same
               time affords to persons of more matured taste such an insight into the state of connoisseurship on the continent, that it is to be wondered that no one has, until now, endeavored to make it more generally acceptable
               by means of an English version. Although Mr. Burtin’s work, which was published
               in 1808, at Brussels, cannot now be considered as new, and makes no pretension
               to the character of a profound disquisition on the art of paintings, yet no publication of a previous or later date, addressed itself so directly to the wants and wishes of amateurs, or supplies so compendious a general view of the subject of which it treats.

            published in this city, contain a large amountof exquisite music by the first writers of Germany. The enterprize in producing such works is truly
            praiseworthy. There are two German collections; one published in very
            excellent style by F. P. Dyer, Hudson st.; the other we have not seen. But, beautiful as these glees are, a constant practice of them will be sure
            to induce a hard, constrained, and mechanical method of singing. They are charming in melody and rich in harmony, but they are, for the most part,
            simply harmonized airs. 
         </p>
         
         <p>Not so the glees before us. These are not inferior to the German glees either in melody or in harmony, while as compositions they rank far above them.
            In fact the English Glees form a school of music entirely peculiar to England:
            no other nation possesses the same class of music, or if they do, only in an inferior degree. The English Glees are generally found to consist of
            two, three, or more movements, all carrying out one clear and broad design, and they are distinguished by the beautiful simplicity of their melody,
            the richness and clearness of their harmony, and the freedom and vigor of
            their counterpoint. There cannot be found any compositions more beautiful, in the
            whole range of vocal music, than many of the four and five-voiced glees by Webber, Horsly, Calcott, Mornington, Bishop, &amp;c. &amp;c. Besides,the
            class of glees now under notice does not require such an incessant strain upon the
            extreme parts—1st tenor and 2d bass—as is the case with the German Glees; they are
            in fact more truly vocal.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are many beautiful glees in Riley’s collection, such as “Here in cool Grot
            and Mossy Cell,” “Peace to the Souls of the Heroes,” “O! happy Fair your Eves are Loadstars,” "The Friars,” &amp;c. &amp;c.; beside some capital
            duetts,catches, and rounds. We can recommend the Glee Club Companion to all
            our glee singing friends, as a work select, if not extensive; well got up, and very
            cheap.

         <p>We are positively to have a French Opera at the Park in a few weeks. Its success will be, we feel assured, quite complete. The company is stronger than
            any we have seen here, and comprises both beauty and talent. The school of music
            too, is, to our taste, much, very much superior to the modern Italian music so
            hackneyed now on every hand. We shall be glad to find it better known and
            appreciated by the public.
         </p>
         
         <p>That most delightful of all summer resorts, Niblo’s Garden, opens next Monday. There will be an English Vaudeville Company in addition
            to the attractions of the locality. We have not heard anything positive respecting the engagements made, but we presume as Mr. Chippendale is the manager, he will gather around him a strong and attractive company. We shall be glad to see the place thronged as it always has been with the beauty and the fashion of the city.
         </p>
         
         <p>The season at Castle Garden can scarcely be said to have begun, for the weather
            has been so wretchedly unpropitious since it opened, that the attractions of that
            lovely spot have not as yet been fairly tested.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is understood that the Italians are engaged to appear, with a whole host of
            novelties of an attractive nature. All those who really enjoy music, society, pure
            air and lovely scenery, should visit Castle Garden often.
         </p>
         
         <p>Madl’le Borghese, it is said, will be on here this summer her intention of
            visiting Mexico having been abandoned in consequence of not being able to form a
            full company. It is more than probable that Mr. Krev’s Opera, if successful in
            Philadelphia, will be produced here within a short time.
         </p>
         
         <p>We hear of a Concert, upon a grand scale, to be given very shortly.
            The performance will consist of a Sacred Drama, never before given in this city.
            The composer is Carl Lowe, and the music is of a high order and so full of melody
            that its popularity is certain. The best talent of the City will be
            engaged, the chorus will not only be large but efficient, and every
            thing will be conducted on a scale of liberality which cannot fail to meet with
            public approbation and support.— We shall be able to speak more positively in our
            next number.

         <p>New-York can boast of more charming pictures, tableaux vivants, than any other
            city in the world. The assertion is a very broad one, but we believe that nobody
            who has been over the world, will deny its truth. Since the season has fairly become sunny and natural, and the streets intolerably dusty, and
            uncomfortable, the most delightful sights are to be seen on the water. The Bay has
            been unusually lively during the past week. A few days since as we were crossing
            one of the lower ferries, our eyes lighted upon the most showy tableaux of
            sea-grouping that they had ever been gladdened by. On one hand lay the majestic three-decker North Carolina, the beautiful Sicilian frigate, a revenue
            Cutter, and a host of smaller craft; and on the other side were the stately
            Columbus, the corvette Vincennes, and a crowd of East river sloops, intermingled with a Liverpool packet and a dozen small steamers; the large Sound-boats, Narragansett, Rhode-Island, and Worcester, came
            plunging their vast white bodies with a multitude of human beings on their upper
            decks, and setting everything afloat in commotion by the waves raised by their
            huge paddles. A tow-boat from Philadelphia with a long string of barges in her wake, and another from Albany, looking like a floating village, came
            along at the same moment, and filled up the picture, when suddenly there darted out from among the apparently inextricable mass of floating worlds, a little fairy looking yacht, with "Ospray” emblazoned on her stern, and with sails that sat like a new coat on a
            dandy. The wind was brisk and for a moment appearances threatened a general crash,
            but there proved to be sea room enough, and each bark went on its way rejoicing,
            throwing the spray like snow-drifts all over the broad Bay.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is always something to be seen worth a walk down to the Battery, besides the new Opera House. The corporation owe it to the inhabitants of the city
            to introduce two or three fountains into the Battery, and then it would be without a rival in the world. The Park is always pleasant, tho’ just
            now dusty; one day this week, with all its green trees, and fountain and sun
            shine, it looked sad enough; a poor gentleman, weary of the world, selected this
            spot to blow out his brains in. Crossing over from Broadway to Chatham street, in the rear of the Hall, we heard the report of a pistol, and, turning
            our head, saw at a few paces off, a well-dressed man fall to the ground. The poor
            man's name was Wilson, his profession was the law, and pecuniary trouble is said to have caused the deed.

         <div class="head">NATIVE TALENT VS. FOREIGN TALENT.</div>
         
         <p>The following observances apply with so much force to the violent and exclusive principle, which has been so broadly laid down, in reference to “American Artists,” “American Poets,” “American Native talent,”
            &amp;c. that we can with great propriety give them a place in our columns. They
            are selected from an European, continental journal. The origin however, of the
            article we have nothing to do with— it is the truth and the force of the remarks to
            which we claim attention. We assume that taste and talent, in music, in
            paintings, in writing, &amp;c. whatever be their origin or birthplace, belongs to the whole world. We can rarely listen to a speech in congress, to a lecture upon any subject, by an American, or read any American
            work upon the Arts, in which we do not find a laboured effort to show forth the
            vast strength and beauty of Native American talent. It is in bad taste, and
            about as appropriate, as if a comely youth possessing nature’s finest personal
            graces were to stand in Broadway and lay claim to the admiration of all passers by, in order to distinguish him from the vulgar or less prepossessing
            multitude.
         </p>
         
         <p>These observations apply especially lo the literature of our country, and perhaps
            with as much justice to the works of art.
         </p>
         
         <p>From a Hamburgh paper, respecting an Architectural competition we copy the following: </p>
         
         <p>“Is it true patriotism to prefer the design of a native artist, excellent though it be, when confessedly less correspondent than that of another, to
            the true genius of German architecture? The English are not thus limited in their
            views. It is well known that M. de Chateauneauf received one of the prizes in the competition for the new London Exchange. It is a spurious
            patriotism that would give to our whole city a church of an inferior design, merely
            that we might bestow our patronage (?) on one of its inhabitants.— The love of
            our country, the love of German art in its most sublime and most significant sense, speaks most unquestionably for the design of the English architect,
            who, deriving his inspiration from the genius of Germany, has entered with
            love into his work, and given us what pre-eminently belongs to us—the purest
            Gothic form—the national architecture of our father-land. Let us away then with the
            petty patronage, that has no fellowship with the beautiful, but to envy it.—
            Follow, rather, the better example.”

            <p>“It is the heaviest stone melancholy can throw at a man,” says old Fuller, "to
               tell him that he is at the end of his being; a truth, which excellent, witty,
               stout-hearted Thomas Hood has been rather playing with as a football or
               shuttlecock any time these ten years than receiving as so gloomy a missive. But alas, the time for skirmishing with so severe au antagonist, seems
               welll nigh over, and Hood, with the certainty of immediate death before him, is
               receiving from friends and the press, those honors which are too often withheld
               for posterity and the "dull cold ear.” A late number of the magazine which be has just established, announces his approaching dissolution, and commends him as a very great author. His merits will appear to us
               the greater when the light is withdrawn and we sit in darkness. A writer starts
               up to amuse and enlighten us through the press—day after day, month after month,
               he pours out an unceasing flow of jests, and sentiment, and wisdom; we take the
               gift, and never look for the giver: it seems a matter of course that the morning
               paper should be wise and witty, just as the morning sun is expected to shine.
               But little reputation is formed in this benevolent and beneficial way. But
               let a pompous author time his appearance with a due attention to self and his own
               want of power, and come forward in au octavo, we hail the man. We are willing to
               praise the one, but we cannot live without the other. This is the difference, but
               the honor should be more wisely distributed.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>How Hood has borne up against the inroads of a long disease, the consumption, let him tell us himself in a passage of his mirthful philosophy
               written in 1839—the very fingers so aristocratically slender, that now hold the
               pen, hint plainly of the ‘ills that flesh is heir to;’ my coats have become
               great-coats, my pantaloons have been turned into trowsers, and, by a worse
               bargain than Peter Schlemihl’s I seem to have retained my shadow and sold my
               substance. In short, as happens to prematurely old port wine, I am of a bad color
               with very little body. But what then? That emaciated hand still lends a
               hand to embody words, and sketches the creations and recreations of a Merry
               Faney: those gaunt sides yet shake heartily as ever at the Grotesques and Arabesques, and dull Picturesques that my Good Genius (a
               Pantagruelian familiar) charitably conjures up to divert me from more sombre
               realities. * * * * The raven croaked,but I persuaded myself that it was the
               nightingale: there was the smell of the mould, but I remembered that it
               nourished the violets.” There was faith and a sound heart there. It was not for
               nothing. Since that day Hood has written some of his best verses, his quaintest
               stories are his most philanthropic appeals. English readers and English hearts will not soon forget them. If Hood revives once more,
               he will be a sacred man while he lives. The sympathy of the good is with
               him. We trust we are violating no courtesy of private life while we quote from a
               letter received by the last steamer, from a source which adds pathos to every
               line, if that were necessary:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Poor Hood is dying—in a state of perfect preparation and composure, among the tears of his friends. His disease has been consumption—is, in fact—but the crisis is combined with water on the chest, which is
               expected to bring death. To a friend who asked him the other morning how it was
               with him, he answered with a characteristic playful pathos, "The tide is
               rising—and I shall soon he in port.” It is said of him, that he has no regrets
               for life, except for the unborn works which he feels striving impotently in his
               dying brain—a species of regret which is peculiarly affecting to me, as it must
               be to all who understand it: also it is plain to me that he has genius greater
               than anything he has produced—and if this is plain and sad to us, how
               profoundly melancholy it must be to him. The only comfort is that the end of development is not here. Sir Robert Peel wrote a long letter to him
               lately in a tone of respect and consideration, which was honorable to the
               minister, and relieved him from becoming anxiety by attaching his pension to the
               life of his wife rather than to bis own. Poor Hood and poor Sydney Smith! How we
               are losing our Yoricks!'all dumb’—‘all gone!’”

            <div class="biblPage">348</div>
            
            <p>An American gentleman who has lately returned from Europe,
               brings with him the following anecdote of Tennyson. At a German inn he met
               with an Englishman remarkable in a three-fold manner; for his appearance, which was interesting and striking—for his conversation, which was
               markedly peculiar—and for his hat, which, for the length of time it had been
               ignorant of a nap, might have balanced the seven sleepers in the economy of nature. One day the two strangers were put into the same vehicle to
               visit a ruin or a waterfall, and, then, for the first time, the Englishman
               discovered that his companion was an American. Upon learning this, he drew a note
               book from his pocket, and taking from it a copy in MS. of "Tennyson’s Mariana in
               the Moated Grange,” asked the American if he had ever seen it. "Certainly,”
               was the reply; "I am very familiar with it.” "But is Tennyson much esteemed in
               America?” "He is admired by all whose admiration is an honor.” "Is he?”
               exclaimed the Englishman, with boyish delight glowing from his face, "Why, I’m
               Tennyson!”
            </p>
            
            <p>The anecdote is highly characteristic of Tennyson; he appears to be in the habit of showing his poems in manuscript to his acquaintances. The
               last number of the Knickerbocker contains a poem which an American gentleman in
               England obtained from him in this manner. As it has never appeared before in
               print, we copy it for its novelty.

               <br></br>Of the land that gave us birth,
               
               <br></br>We stood tranced in long embraces,
               
               <br></br>Mixed with kisses sweeter, sweeter
               
               <br></br>Than any thing on earth!
               
               
               
               <br></br>A shadow flits before me.
               
               <br></br>Not thou, but like to thee
               
               <br></br>Oh, Christ! that it were possible,
               
               <br></br>For one short hour, to see
               
               <br></br>The souls we love, that they might tell us
               
               <br></br>What and where they be!
               
               <br></br>It leads me forth at evening.
               
               <br></br>And lightly winds and steals
               
               <br></br>In a cold white robe before me,
               
               <br></br>When all my spirit reels
               
               <br></br>At the shouts, the leagues of light,
               
               <br></br>The roaring of the wheels!
               
               
               <br></br>Half the night I waste in sighs,
               
               <br></br>Half in dreams I sorrow alter
               
               <br></br>The hand, the lip, the eyes,
               
               <br></br>The winsome laughter;
               
               <br></br>And I hear the pleasant ditty
               
               <br></br>That I heard her chaunt of old;
               
               <br></br>But I wake—my dream is fled!
               
               <br></br>Without knowledge, without pity,
               
               <br></br>In the shuddering gray behold,
               
               <br></br>By the curtains of my bed,
               
               <br></br>That dreadful phantom cold.
               
               <br></br>Pass, thou death-like type of pain!
               
               <br></br>Pass, and cease to move about:
               
               <br></br>'Tis the blot upon the brain,
               
               <br></br>That will show itself without.
               
               
               <br></br>Now I rise; the eave-drops fall,
               
               <br></br>And the yellow vapors choke
               
               <br></br>The great city sounding wide;
               
               <br></br>Day comes; a dull red ball
               
               <br></br>In a drift of lurid smoke,
               
               <br></br>O’er the misty river tide.
               
               <br></br>Through the hubbub of the market
               
               <br></br>I steal a wasted frame;
               
               <br></br>It crosseth here, it crosseth there,
               
               <br></br>Through all that crowd confused and loud,
               
               <br></br>That shadow still the some;
               
               <br></br>And on my heavy eyelids
               
               <br></br>My anguish hangs like shame.
               
               <br></br>Alas! for her that met me,
               
               <br></br>That heard me softly call,
               
               <br></br>Came glimmering through the laurels,
               
               <br></br>At the quiet evening full,
               
               <br></br>In the garden by the terrace
               
               <br></br>Of the old memorial hall.
               
               
               <br></br>The broad light glares and heats,
               
               <br></br>And the sunk eve flits and fleets,
               
               <br></br>And will not let me be;
               
               <br></br>I loathe the squares and streets,
               
               <br></br>And the faces that one meets,
               
               <br></br>Hearts with no love for me;
               
               <br></br>Only I long to creep
               
               <br></br>To some still cavern deep,
               
               <br></br>And weep, and weep, and weep
               
               <br></br>My whole soul out to thee!

         <p>Anastatic Printing.—We extract the following interesting particulars in regard to Anastatic Printing, from Appleton’s Literary Bulletin.</p>
         
         <p>On the 25th ult., I attended a Lecture at the Royal Institution, by Prof.
            Faraday, on the Philosophy of the Anastatic Process of Printing, in which all the
            details of the practice were explained and exhibited. The principle rests on some
            of the properties of the articles employed: “as water attracts water, oil oil,
            though they mutually repel each other. Metals are much more easily welted
            with oil than with water; but they may readily be moistened by a weak solution of gum, and still more when a portion of phosphoric acid is added.” (The lecturer here alluded to some remarkable investigations
            recently made on these phenomena, by Prof. Henry, of Princeton, N.J.) To these
            properties of oil, water, and the metals, may be added, as one of the principles
            of the Anastatic Process, the readiness with which part of the ink of any
            newly printed book, &amp;c., can be transferred by pressure to any smooth
            surface, an effect well known to bookbinders. The subject to be copied is first
            moistened with diluted nitric acid, the superfluous moisture pressed out between
            folds of bibulous paper, and then pressed with sufficient force in a rolling
            press on a sheet of clean polished zinc. The acid etches the metal, and the
            printed portion is left slightly in relief. The principles above stated are
            now brought into operation. The zinc plate is washed with a weak solution of gum
            and phosphatic acid, by which the etched surface is completely welled, while that
            portion to which the ink has adhered remains perfectly dry. An inked roller is
            now passed over the surface, inking only those parts untouched by the water; 
            the strung repulsion between the oily and watery surfaces preserves the design
            in the clearest manner. In this condition of the plate impressions can be taken
            in the same manner as from
            lithographic stone, and as many as three thousand impressions have
            been when without any deterioration being apparent. Should, however, the
            impressions yielded prove deficient in clearness, it is only necessary to wash
            the zinc plate with turpentine, when it is immediately restored to its pristine
            condition. Old books, in which the ink has become hardened, are first soaked in a solution of potass, and then of tartaric acid, producing the
            bitartrate of potass; this permeating the texture of the paper, resists oil, and the inkroller passed over its surface, the ink only adheres to the
            printed parts. The tartrate is then washed out, and the copy proceeded with
            as before, commencing with the nitric acid.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>We made an announcement a few months back of a volume in
            preparation,by the American Ethnological Society; from the following intelligence in the
            Bulletin, it appears to be nearly ready for publication.
         </p>
         
         <p>The American Ethnological Society, of which the Hon. Albert Gallatin is
            President, will publish in a few days the first volume of its "Transactions,” in
            one large octavo volume. This work will consist of articles by members of the Society, relating to various topics of interest to the Antiquary and
            Philologist. The first article, filling more than half the volume, is by the venerable President of the Society, on Ancient Mexico, its History,
            Chronology, Language, Civilization, &amp;c., including an analysis of Lord Kingsborough’s great work. Mr. Schoolcraft has “an Essay on the
            Grave Creek mound of Virginia.” Mr. Turner a “Dissertation on the Himyaritic
            Inscriptions lately discovered in Southern Arabia,” together with notices of the
            Ancient Hamyatites. Mr. Catherwood has an article giving an account of his visit
            to the site of ancient Carthage, with a particular account of the LybiaPhoenician Monument at Dugga. The volume will contain numerous engravings, price $2 50. Copies may be obtained through D. Appleton
            &amp; Co.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Piano Fortes.—We mentioned a week or two since, a very fine toned and mahogany cased piano,
            made by J. H. Chambers, 385 Broadway. We spoke of it in terms of strong
            praise, because it deserved it in every way, and we refer to it now simply
            to inform those who are in want of a piano, that Mr. Chambers has now in his
            store a fac-simile of the very instrument we then praised. It is worth calling at
            the store if only to see its form and hear its tone.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Last Piece, or the Le Morceau Honteux.—A public story-teller related an anecdote of two or three persons being in
            company where a simple piece of cake had long defied all approach, from the circumstance of its being the last piece in the dish. It so
            happened, however, that the candle was accidentally extinguished, when each of
            the party immediately encountered the hand of his neighbor on the devoted
            morsel.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The editor of the Knickerbocker announces in his "Editor’s Table” a volume, which, in its externals, will be
            all that could be desired, to be entitled "Old Knick’s Sketch Book, or the
            Omissions and Com missions, Fore-thoughts and after-thoughts, of the last fifteen
            years to be published by Burgess, Stringer &amp; Co. We have no very clear
            idea of what the work will be, but should infer from the title that it will
            be made up from the amusing contents of the "Editor’s Table.”
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Douglas Gerold’s idea or Conservatives.—There’s a sort of people in the world that can’t bear making any
            progress. I wonder they ever walk, unless they walk backwards! I wonder they
            don’t refuse to go out when there’s a new moon—and all out of love and respect
            for that "ancient institution,” the old one. But there always were such
            people, and always will be. When lucifers first came in, how many old women,
            staunch old souls—many of them worthy to be members of parliament—stood by their
            matches and tinder boxes, and cried out "no surrender!" And how many of these
            old women—disguised in small attire—every day go about at public meetings,
            professing to be ready to die for any tinder-box question that may come up! Yes,
            ready, quite ready to die for it; all the readier, perhaps, because dying for any thing of the sort’s gone out of fashion.”
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Births, Deaths, and Marriages.—Within the past three weeks the New Wordl weekly paper has died, the Plebeian,
            daily, has been married to the Morning News, and the Alleghanian, weekly, has been born. The first of these journals was an admirable paper
            from the beginning, the only bad thing about it wasits name, which was very
            good per se. as Captain Tyler says, but quite inapplicable, the contents of the paper being mainly extracted from the Old World; the cause of its
            untimely departure from this sorrowing world we have never learned. The newly bom
            "Alleghenian" has a very pleasant appearance, and we hope will live to
            bless the day that gave it birth.
         </p>
         
         <p>The death (we beg the printer not to make this word rend dearth) of newspapers
            is a subject full of matter for an article, and we intend to enlarge upon it by
            and by, after we have collected a sufficient amount of statistics. All men are
            born to die, but some newspapers seem born for immortality, they live in an
            atmosphere of eternal sun-shine and prosperity; while others, like young
            cauliflowers and other tender vegetables, are nipped by the frost in the
            first year of their existence.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Consequences of Curtailment.—A London paper contains the following: “Messrs Chalcn, Stanfield, Leslie,
            Ceristail, Stump and Ward, have left in the ship Victoria for New York,it is understood, to paint the Hall of Congress of the United States.
            There were a large number of persons to see them off. They left on the 20th.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The indignation this called forth was particularly frightful—the loss of the
            whole region of Oregon, on both sides of the Columbia river, was as nothing
            compared to the insult thus offered by Congress to American artists. We met with
            the paragraph in the course of our porings over foreign files, and really it excited neither alarm or astonishment, because we happened to read
            to the end. The paragraph concluded thus, and clearly proved the joke—"and
            returned the same evening to London, having gone no further than Gravesend.”
         </p>          
         
         
         <p>The "Dashes at Life" by Mr. Willis were received at so late a period, that we have been unable to do more than announce it. We shall, of course, speak of it very fully
            hereafter. Our opinion of Mr. Willis is well known.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The beautiful “Unseen River,” published in this week’s Journal, is the composition of Henry B.
            Hirst. We extract it, by permission, from a volume of forthcoming poems.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Largest Letter in the World.—Mr. John R. Peters, junr., who accompanied the American Embassy to China,
            strived this morning in the ship Bazaar, and informs us that the Emperor of
            the Celestial dominions has written a letter, in the Chinese and Mantchon
            languages, to the President of the United States, which is six feet long by three
            feet wide! Mr. Peters saw the letter. It is written on yellow paper, enclosed in
            a yellow silk case, and is now in the hands of Dr Parker for translation. It is
            expected that it will be sent home in the next ship.
         </p>
         
         <p>No one can imagine what gratification we feel in communicating this intelligence to the President, that functionary having heretofore borne away the
            palm for long messages. Though we have "licked the Britishers, who licked the world,” it is not improbable that the Emperor of China has “licked”
            us by out-presidenting the President. At any rate Mr. Polk will have this
            consolation— the reading of the document and the necessary reflection thereupon,
            will be a task weighty enough to excuse his being "at home,” to those who
            still pester him about office. By the way might he not, with great propriety,
            create a new office—that of reader of the Emperor of China’s letters? Verily it
            would bo no sinecure.
         </p>
         
         <p>But this long epistle is not the only great thing emanating from the empire of China. Mr. Peters has brought home the largest collection of Chinese
            curiosities yet made, exceeding, we are told, even that made by the late Mr.
            Dunn. We are not informed whether any measures will be taken to gratify the
            curiosity which this information will excite.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Pippin.—This word is derived, by Dr. Johnson, from puppynghe [Dutch]; but it is surely
            more reasonable to suppose it, with other etymologists, from Pepin, the king of
            the country from whence the fruit is derived; as "filberd," from Philibert of
            Franee; while the "rennett” apple is la reinette, or the “little queen;" as
            the "geniting” is from Janeton, or Jeannetin, in honor of some queen or
            lady of that name. The "Bigoroon" cherry is so called from "Bigorre, the
            French province where it is grown; as the original word "cherry” is from
            Cerasus, in Asia Minor; while “may duke” cherry derives its name from Medoc, in
            Burgundy. The brown "bury’’ pear is so named from its buttered or melting quality [beurre]; the ‘“Colmor” pear is from Colmar, in Alsace; and
            the "Cnisse-madame" pear, from its figure. The "arline” is corruption
            from Orleans; the "currant” is the grape of Corinth; and the "damson” [properly damascene] is the plum of Damascus. Menage considers “melon”
            as a large apple, and derives
            t from the Latin and Greek. If esculent vegetables may be noticed, the "Jerusalem artichoke" is a curious instance of the corruption of language, it being the sunflower artichoke, or girasole,
            [the plant turning to the sun,] "Jerusalem” being thus corrupted from
            girasole. Not less remarkable is "John Dory” [the fish] as a corruption of
            il janitore, or, 'the door-keeper for that fish being called, on the Italian
            coast, by the name of St. Peter, and he being supposed to be the door-keeper of
            heaven, and therefore called il janitore by our sailors, we thus derived the term
            of John Dory.

            <br></br>While I am watching on the hill
            
            <br></br>I, and the wailing whippoorwill.
            
            <br></br>          Oh whippoorwill, oh whippoorwill!
            
            
            <br></br>Sleep, sleep! and once again I’11 tell
            
            <br></br>The oft pronounced yet vain farewell:
            
            <br></br>Such should his word, oh maiden, be
            
            <br></br>Who lifts the fated eye to thee;
            
            <br></br>Such should it be, before the chain
            
            <br></br>That wraps his spirit, binds his brain.
            
            <br></br>          Oh whippoorwill, oh whippoorwill!
            
            
            <br></br>Sleep, sleep! the ship hath left the shore,
            
            <br></br>The steed awaits his lord no more;
            
            <br></br>His lord still madly lingers by,
            
            <br></br>The fatal maid he cannot fly—
            
            <br></br>And thirds the wood, and climbs the hill——
            
            <br></br>He and the wailing whippoorwill.
            
            <br></br>          Oh whippoorwill, oh whippoorwill!
            
            
            <br></br>Sleep, sleep! the morrow hastens on;
            
            <br></br>Then shall the wailing slave be gone,
            
            <br></br>Flitting the hill-top fur for fear
            
            <br></br>The sounds of joy may reach his ear;
            
            <br></br>The sounds of joy!—the hollow knell
            
            <br></br>Pealed from the mocking chapel bell.
            
            <br></br>          Oh whippoorwill, oh whippoorwill!

               SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES,
            </div> 
            
            <div class="ab">No. 255 Greene Street, 
               
               <br></br>One door above Waverly Place, New York.
            </div> 
            
            <p>THIS School differs essentially from most others in
               this city, in one particular: the number admitted is so limited that each 
               scholar receives the personal attention and instruction of the principals. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of 
               qualifying himself as an instructor.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France;
               and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course includes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic 
               with Composition. Reading aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the 
               daily exercises of the whole school.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of Ancient and Modern History and the French Language.</p> 
            
            <p>In the higher or AEsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough English course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and 
               Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Composition, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from 
               Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures 
               on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and 
               the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious 
               illustrations from French and English Literature.

            <p>Mr. RICH respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he has 
               formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old establishment in Red 
               Lion square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS published on the continent 
               without the heavy expense attending their transmission through England. 
               Each of these establishments will be conducted by one of his sons, under his 
               own general superintendence. This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of 
               signal advantage to his correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through,
               and small sums paid to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New York. Two and a half 
               per cent, will be allowed to all those who make a remittance with their orders.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years, possesses a knowledge of books and editious not often to be met with, and will be 
               happy to give any advice and information respecting the formation of Libraries 
               or Collections of Books in any particular branch of literature or science. For 
               information in regard to his efficiency, he begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott, 
               Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other literary characters in the United States, to 
               whom he is known. Intending to devote the remainder of his life to literary 
               pursuits, his greatest pleasure will arise from sending rare and valuable books 
               to his own country; and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States
               
               a Library which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If 
               he can live to say," I also assisted IN its formation," his most ardent wishes 
               will be gratified.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich has in the press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova: a Catalogue of 
               Books relating to America, including Voyages to the South Seas and round the 
               World: Part III. from 1831 to 1845, with supplement and index completing the 
               work.
            </p> 
            
            <p>He has also nearly ready for the press, Bibliotheca Americana Vetus: a 
               Catalogue of Books relating to America from the Discovery to the year 1700; 
               with notes and observations: in one volume, 8vo., of about 400 pages.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich has also nearly
               ready, a reprin from Taervenot’s Collection of Father 
               Marquette’s account of the
               discovery of the Mississippi, entitled," Decouverte

               are printed, which will be distributed among Mr. Rich’s friends and correspondents.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. Rich has also purchased the remaining copies of the part relating to 
               America of L’Art do Verifier les Dates: of which ten volumes in octavo, by 
               D. B. Warden, Esq., are printed, and two volumes more, completing the work,

               the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
               given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
               carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
               otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
               has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
               and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini's that pupils will be en
               abled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rudments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson 
               is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from professional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of BERTINI's Method 
               over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the 
               foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the 
               names in the principal cities.
