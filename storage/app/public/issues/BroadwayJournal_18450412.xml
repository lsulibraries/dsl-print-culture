            <p>A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Edited by 
               <span class="person" id="wsmith">William Smith</span>, Ph. D., and illustrated by numerous engravings on wood.
               Third American edition, carefully revised, and containing numerous
               additional articles relative to the Botany, Mineralogy, and Zoology
               of the Ancients. By 
               <span class="person" id="canthon">Charles Anthon</span>, LL. D. New York: Harper and Brothers.
            </p>
            
            <p>This invaluable work is designed to supersede, and must
               entirely supersede the compilations of 
               <span class="person" id="jpotter">Potter</span> and 
               <span class="person" id="aadam">Adams</span>.
               In order to facilitate this design, there is appended an Index
               Raisonné, in which the whole subject (of Greek and Roman
               Antiquities) is classified under appropriate heads, so that, by
               means of the Index, the book, although retaining the advantages of a dictionary, may be made to answer readily all the
               college purposes of a text-book. In every respect this work
               is the most valuable of its class--or rather it is a class by
               itself. It includes all the recent discoveries of the Germans,
               and has all the fulness and accuracy for which the German
               scholars are noted. Dr. 
               <span class="person" id="canthon">Anthon</span> has enriched the American
               edition by a fund of information on scientific topics, distinguishing his own matter by asterisks. He has also introduced some most obvious improvements in form and method, of
               which latter he is a master at all points. He is not only
               the best scholar in America--but perhaps the most absolutely accurate one in the world. Independently of the high opinion we cannot help entertaining of his erudition and acumen,
               we would stand by his decision in any mere matter of classical fact, in preference to that of any man in Europe, or
               elsewhere. His books are universally circulated, and universally approved, except by those who have an obvious interest in decrying them. Dr. 
               <span class="person" id="canthon">Anthon</span> would, no doubt, have
               given more satisfaction, in certain quarters, had he thought
               more of his own merely literary reputation, and kept his eye
               less steadily fixed on the true purpose of compilations such
               as he has undertaken--the purpose of making a useful book.
               His talents, nevertheless, have long ago placed him in a
               Position at which he is left free to pursue this good purpose,
               in his own manner, and without fear of doing injury to his
               reputation as an original writer, in the opinion of any one
               having sense enough to understand that there is a point at
               which originality ceases to be a virtue. We presume he is
               by no means ambitious of the fame of a mere litterateur.

            <p>
               <span class="person" id="jmichelet">Michelet</span>'s History of France, from the Earliest Period to the
               Present Time. D. Appleton &amp; Co. 200 Broadway.
            </p>
            
            <p>One of the great merits of this unique history consists of
               a vein of intense national feeling that pervades the entire
               work, and colors its whole materials with the hues of Gaul.
               The reader very soon becomes infected with the heat of the
               historian, and forgets that there is any other country than
               France. 
               <span class="person" id="jmichelet">M. Michelet</span>talks, it is true, of a noble generalization-an abstract idea of home but little dependent on the
               senses, which will conduct him by a new effort to the idea
               of a universal country, a new city of Providence. But it is
               an effort which he has yet to make, and an idea yet to be realised. His sole idea of a country in his history, is France;
               his sole idea of France is Paris. In this he is a genuine
               Frenchman--a Parisian of Paris; and his history is all the
               better for it. It is what it professes to be--a history of
               France--not a history of French kings, warriors, and statesmen, but of French people, from the cobbler in his stall to
               the king on his throne; the sports, the superstitions, and
               the trades of the people as well as their wars and robberies,
               which other historians have considered the only acts of a
               people worthy of notice. He not only gives us the history
               of the people, but the fields and shops in which they labored, the cities in which they dwelt, their persons, habits, and
               local traditions. While the novelist strives to give his tale
               the appearance of history, by solemn generalizations and pedantic descriptions, 
               <span class="person" id="jmichelet">M. Michelet</span> adopts the true novelesque
               style in his history, rapid, brilliant, and minute. He is the
               most picturesque, imaginative, and familiar of historians.
               There is a picture in every page, and something to startle
               the thoughts in every sentence. As he skims over the surface
               of the country every thing arrests his eye--towers, churches,
               castles, fairs, orchards, battles, canals, artists, rivers, ships,
               herds and cottages. His is the history of a country, not of a
               country's rulers.
            </p>
            
            <p>We make a few extracts from the description of the wine
               countries, "Lyonnais, Burgundy and Champagne; a vinous,
               joyous zone, fraught with poetry, eloquence, and elegant and
               ingenious literature."
            </p>
            
            <p>"There is none of the amenity of Burgundy in the dry and sombre
               districts of Autun and Morvan. To know the true Burgundy, the Burgundy of cheering smiles and of the grape, you must ascend the Saône
               by Châlons, then turn, through the Côte d'Or, to the plateau of Dijon,
               and follow the current towards Auxerre--a goodly land, where vineleaves adorn the arms of the cities, where all are brothers or cousins,
               a land of hearty livers and of merry Christmases.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Burgundy is a land of orators; of lofty and solemn eloquence.
               From the upper part of this province, from the district which gives
               rise to the Seme--from Dijon, and from Montbar--issued the voices
               which have most resounded through France, those of St, Bernard, of
               Bossuet, and of Buffon. But the sentimentality characteristic of Bur
               gundy, is observable in other quarters--more graceful in the north,
               more brilliant in the south. Not far from Semur were born the good
               Madame de Chantal, and her grand-daughter, Madame de Sévigné;
               at Macon, 
               <span class="person" id="adlamartine">Lamartine</span>, the poet of the religious and lonely-minded;
               and at Charolles, 
               <span class="person" id="equinet">Edgar Quinet</span>, the poet of history and of humanity.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Burgundy seems still to be allied to its wines; the spirit of Beaune and of Macon mounts to the head like that of Rhenish. Burgundinn eloquence trenches on the rhetorical; and the amplitude of ita
               literary style is not ill typified in the exuberant charms of the women of Vermanton and Auxerre. Flesh and blood reign here: inflation, as well, and vulgar sentimentality; in proof, I need only cite
               
               <span class="person" id="cpjdcrébillon">Crébillon</span>, 
               <span class="person" id="hbdlongepierre">Longepierre</span>, and 
               <span class="person" id="mjsedaine">Sedaine</span>. Something more sombre and severe is required to constitute the core of France.
            </p>
            
            <p>"'Tis a sad fall to step from Burgundy into Champagne, and to leave
               its smiling slopes for low and chalky plains. Not to speak of the desert of Champagne-Pouilleuse, (the lousy,) the country is almost universally flat, pale, and of a chillingly prosaic aspect. The cattle are
               sorry; the plants and minerals present no variety. Dull rivers drag
               their chalky streams between banks poorly shaded by young or stunted poplars The houses young too, and frail at their birth, endeavour
               to protect their fragile existence, by hooding themselves under as
               many slates as possible, or, at least, poor wooden slates: but beneath
               many slating and its paint, washed off by the rain, the chalk bebetrays itself, pile, dirty, and misery stricken.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Such houses cannot make fine cities. Châlons looks hardly more
               lively than the plains around it. Troyes is almost as ugly as it is industrious The striking width of the streets of Reims makes its low
               houses appear lower still, and creates a gloomy impression--Reims,
               formerly the city of citizens aud of priests, and twin sister of Tours,
               a sugarish city, with a tinge of devotion, manufacturing rosaries and
               gingerbread, excellent common cloth, an excellent small wine, and
               the seat both of fairs and of pilgrimages.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Champagne was the land of good stories, of droll anecdotes of the
               noble knight, the simple and unsuspicious husband, of Monsieur, the
               parson, and his servant lass. The genius for tale-telling, which prevails in Champagne and in Flanders, expanded into long poems and
               fine histories. 
               <span class="person" id="cdtroyes">Chrétien de Troyes</span>, and 
               <span class="person" id="gdprovins">Guyot de Provins</span>, begin the
               list of our romance poets. The great lords of the country wrote their
               own actious--witness 
               <span class="person" id="gdvillehardouin">Villehardouin</span>, 
               <span class="person" id="jdjoinville">Joinville</span>, and the cardinal 
               <span class="person" id="jfpdgondi">de
                  Retz
               </span>, who have themselves n rrated to us the history of the Crusades
               and of the Fronde. History and satire are the vocation of the Champenois. While 
               <span class="person" id="thibaud">Count Thibiaut</span> had his poems painted on the walls of
               his palace of Provins, surrounded by roses from the East, the grocers of 
               <span class="person" id="cdtroyes">Troyes</span> scrawled on their counters the allegorical and satirical
               histories of Renard aud Isengrin. The most pungent pamphlet in our
               language--the satire of Menippee--is mostly due to some lawyers of
               this city.
            </p>
            
            <p>"In this viny and literary zone, the mind of man has gone on increasing in distinctness and sobriety of thought. We have signalised
               three stages of this progress--the fire and intellectual intoxication of
               the south, the eloquence and rhetoric of Burgundy, and the grace and
               irony of Champagne. This is the last and most delicate fruit which
               France has borne. On these white plains and hungry slopes ripens
               the light wine of the north, full of caprice and sudden sallies. Scarcely does it owe anything to the soil; it is the child of labor and society.
               And here also grew that trifling thing (
               <span class="person" id="jdlafontaine">La Fontaine</span>), profound, nevertheless, and at once ironical and dreamy, that discovered and exhausted the domain of fable."
            </p>
            
            <p>"The jeering spirit of the north of France displays itself in the popular fetes. In Champagne and other parts we find the roi de l'aumone, (a citizen chosen to deliver two prisoners, &amp;c.); the roi de l'
               étouf--king of the ball (Dupin, Deux-Sevres); the rot dee Arbalétriere,
               with his knights; the roi dee guétife, king of the poor; the roi dee rosiers, king of the roses, or king ol the gardeners, still kept up in Normandy, Burgundy, Champagne, &amp;e. At Paris, the féte des sous diacres, or diacressouls, tipsy priests, who elected a bishop of unreason,
               offered him incense of burnt leather, sang obscene songs, and turned
               the altar into a table. At Evreux, on the first of May, St. Vital's day,
               was the féte dee cornards, cuckold's holiday, when they crowned each
               other with leaves; the priests wore their surplices the wrong side
               outward, and threw bran in each other's eyes; the bell-ringers pelted
               each other with casse-museaux--hard biscuits. At Beauvais, a girl
               and child were promenaded round the town, taken to mass, and the
               burden of the chorus was hi-han! At Reims, the canons promenaded
               in two files, each dragging a herring, and stepping on the herring
               dragged by the one before him. At Bouchain was the féte du prévot
               des étourdis, of the captain of the careless; at Chalons-sur-Saone, of
               the gaillardons, the brave boys; at Paris, of the enfans sans souci,
               sons of mirth; of the régiment de la calotte, the fool's-cap company;
               and of the confrérie de l'aloyau, the brotherhood of beef-eaters! At
               Dijon, the procession of the mére folle, mother madcap. At Harfleur,
               on Shrove Tuesday, the féte de la scie, the saw fete, (a saw figures in
               the arms of the president Cosse Brissac.) The magistrates kiss the
               teeth of the saw. Two monks carry the baton friseux (uprights of the
               saw). Then the baton friseux is taken to a husband, who beats his
               wife. The Chevalerie d'Honfleur has existed since the conquest of
               William."

            <p>We must defer to another time a full notice of the merits
               of this very excellent work. We are happy to learn that a
               second edition has been called for, because it shows a just
               appreciation in the public of a work of unpretending utility,
               and because it is a pretty good assurance that a certain number of persons have been benefitted by its use. It is a rare
               thing to find a good reader, yet no person who is not afflicted
               by a malformation of his organs, can have a good excuse for
               reading badly. The directions in Mr. Vanderhoff's book are
               so simple, so easy of comprehension, and may be so readily
               practised, that there should be no mercy shown, hereafter, to
               any slovenly or inelegant reader, who has the means to possess himself of a copy of this excellent system.

            </p>
            
            <p>This is an enlargement of Dr. 
               <span class="person" id="canthon">Anthon</span>'s previous grammar,
               and is chiefly a translation and abridgement from the various
               grammars of 
               <span class="person" id="rkühner">Kuhner</span>--presenting a compend of all that is
               essential for the student.
            </p>
            
            <p>The work has the novel feature of frequent reference to
               the Sanscrit and other cognate languages--without which
               reference no Greek grammar can be considered complete.
               This is decidedly, for American students, the best book of its
               class extant. It is published in the peculiarly neat and durable form which distinguishes all the classical works of its
               author.

            <p>This is a large and handsome octavo of some 700 pages.
               As yet we have not fully read the work, and are of course
               unable to speak of it with decision. Its subject is certainly
               an important one; and if the views of 
               <span class="person" id="ffgouraud">M. Gouraud</span>be carried out, they must lead to magnificent results. That his
               theory (we use the word in its widest sense) has been vigorously opposed, is by no means a proof of any defect in the
               theory itself--on the contrary it is a proof it is worthy at
               least very serious examination--although to be sure, it is
               merely a non distributio medii thence to infer that all vituperated books are meritorious. We confess, however, that
               in our rapid survey of 
               <span class="person" id="ffgouraud">M. Gouraud</span>'s system, we became impressed wiih a sense of his philosophical ability; and one
               thing is certain that his volume, if only for the amount of
               well-digested and various information it embodies, is worth
               double the sum demanded for it. We shall speak of it more
               fully hereafter.

               has been sustained by the universal opinion of the press. It
               is, unfortunately, quite a matter of course, to puff an illustrated edition of the scriptures, and many have by such unworthy means gained a wide circulation. But we shall never lend our columns for any such mercenary purpose, and
               when we pronounce Marlin's edition of the Bible the most
               beautiful, the most complete, and the cheapest, considering

               do but express our deliberate and sincere belief. There is
               delight in the mere contemplation of the beauty of (he typography, the generous margin which surrounds the text, and
               in the delicate, but firm texture of the paper. Taken altogether, even in these days of cheap publishing, it is a miracle of cheapness.

            <p>This is No. 49 of the "Library of Select Novels," and
               embraces 125 closely printed octavo pages, in minion, double
               columns,--yet is sold for a shilling--a thing difficult to understand. It can scarcely be expected that this state of affairs can last; and we advise all to secure a complete set of
               the "Library of Select Novels." We doubt if in the world
               there exists in the same compass, for anything like the same
               price, the same amount of excellent light reading as will be
               found in the 49 numbers of this series. The Improvisatore
               is a peculiar work, and affects the reader with a singular
               sense of the new in letters:--this feeling results from our
               want of acquaintance with the Danish turn of thought and
               expression.

         <p>The desire, common to all men who cannot originate, of
            looking into the inmost nature of men of genius, (the "seers
            and makers," as they were styled in the older tongue,)
            prevails in me, I confess, with full power. Hence it
            was that I found myself turning from 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>'s letters to
            
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span>, where the great man wears the graceful dishabille
            of social friendship, to the picture of the same mind in the
            half dress which it exhibits, in "Der Briefwechsel mit einem
            Kinde." Nothing can be in greater contrast than the same
            individual under the two different aspects. In his letters to
            
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span>, 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> is frank, cordial, and self-disclosing, fully
            conscious that he is an acknowledged dictator, and therefore
            laying aside all outward emblems of power, while he meets
            
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span> on the broad ground of community of feeling and
            opinion. He does not elevate 
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span> to an equality with
            himself, but descends one step from his canopied dais to meet
            him, and this he does so gracefully, that one scarcely notices
            the kingly condescension of the act. The fact was that
            
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span> won 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>'s respect by his manliness, his truth
            and his genius, while he secured his affection by the unconscious development of his tender and loving nature. Yet to
            gain such a regard from 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>, it was necessary first to
            command his respect, and this no woman ever succeeded in
            obtaining.
         </p>
         
         <p>From his earliest youth, 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> bad been as remarkable
            for his beauty of person as for his powers of mind. Of course
            he was eminently attractive to women. His wonderful mind
            captivated her who could only be approached through the
            intellect, his noble and commanding figure won the admiration of her who had an eye only for physical beauty, and
            his delicate and refined sentiment was irresistible to her who
            needed ideal ministry. From his boyhood, therefore, he had
            been a favorite with the sex, and we need scarcely add, that
            the very worship he received diminished his respect for the
            worshippers. A man may be made vain by the extravagant
            admiration of women, but it never inspires him with self-respect. He learns to doubt, if not its genuineness, at least its
            discrimination, and when he finds women governed, as they
            so usually are, in their likings and dislikings by whim, he
            begins to distrust the very possession of those qualities to
            which he is indebted for their approbation. 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> loved to
            be flattered, and courted, and idolized by women, but he
            cared little for their opinions, except as they might influence
            stronger minds. He looked to his own sex for appreciation.
            The column erected to his fame might be wreathed with
            flowers by gentle hands, but he expected it to be built by the
            strong arm of man.
         </p>
         
         <p>In his "Correspondence with a child," (a child, by the
            way, of twenty years,) which commenced a year or two after
            
            <span class="person" id="fschiller">Schiller</span>'s death, 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> shows himself as having thoroughly
            developed the selfism that in very early life had characterised his first love passage. When he first met 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina Von
               Arnim
            </span>, he had already passed his sixtieth year, his fame was
            established on a sure basis, and his mine of sentiment though
            not exhausted, yet had been so fully worked in real life, as
            well as for the purposes of poetry, that there were no new
            veins of ore to be discovered. 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span> possessed great talent,
            together with a temperament, which, if associated with genius would have produced grand results, but being connected
            with the perceptive instead of the inventive faculty, only sufficed to fill her with a restless enthusiasm and an uneasy sense
            of unappropriated power. Her love for 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>, about which
            so much outcry has been made, was a very harmless fantasy,
            growing out of a girlish admiration of the poet, and afterwards fostered by the vanity of both. That it was the true
            sentiment of love, is too absurd for belief, and that it was the
            effervescence of passion, is worse than absurd. It would
            require an exceedingly spiritualised imagination to exalt Bettina's girlishness into the utterance of that soul-born sympathy which links one with Heaven: and at the same time,
            none but a fancy nurtured on the loathly food of sensualism,
            could discover aught of evil in the exaggerated sentiments
            she expressed. Flattered by the privilege of familiar correspondence with the ruler of German literature, happy in
            his half constrained fondness towards her, proud of being the
            pet and plaything of the lion, 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span> appears to have given
            herself up to the pleasurable excitement without a single
            fear or a moment's calculation. She seems to have remained
            standing on the threshold of womanhood, unwilling to turn
            her back on the irresponsible enjoyments of childhood, yet
            occasionally glancing, half yearningly, towards the veiled
            shrine within the temple. If the hand of 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> sometimes
            lifted that veil, it was only to afford a momentary glimpse of
            the flame which was there burning, and the girl was more
            attracted to the flowers that grew around the porch than to
            the mystic worship of the inner shrine.
         </p>
         
         <p>In order to judge fairly of 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span>, we must take into view
            the peculiarities of the society in which she lived. In England, where conventionalism forms the strongest of all bonds,
            she would have been regarded as a mad woman. In our own
            country where so much freedom of inclination exists among
            her sex, she would probably have discovered much earlier,
            that she was no longer a child, and the affair would have had
            more earnestness and less unconsciousness. But in Germany,
            ever since the days of "Werther" and "Elective Affinities,"
            such things are part of the social system. Their philosophers,
            as well as their poets, have taught the people that impressions may be regarded as precepts, and consequently a want
            of enthusiasm or sensibility is considered by them almost as an
            immorality. We are content with a man if he possesses a
            strong moral sense, but the Germans demand also that he
            shall have an indwelling love for the good as for the beautiful a quick perception of its presence in outward things, and
            an instant recognition of its power, notwithstanding the oppression of circumstances. I, for one, am not disposed to
            blame them: but unfortunately, this extreme susceptibility of
            character makes them attach infinite importance to the
            slightest shades of sentiment, and, as proofs of the existence
            of a feeling, they feel bound to express its every gradation.
            The perfect development of a sentiment is not sufficient in
            their view: they must see the process by which the result
            has been obtained. They are never content with the "piled
            up agony,"--they want to see the agglomeration of each individual pang.
         </p>
         
         <p>This microscopic habit of looking into hearts is peculiarly
            German, and of course gives rise to a world of affectation.
            True feeling shrinks ever from the scalpel of analysis, and an
            emotion which will bear dissection has certainly lost vitality.
            Yet in a country where sensibility is regarded as eminently a
            virtue, it will be as certainly simulated as will be coldness
            and prudery among a people who claim to be moral in proportion as they are unfeeling. Not only this, but where it is
            not feigned and really exists, it will be heightened by fictitious means. If susceptibility be a virtue, then increased
            susceptibility is increased morality, and what would be elsewhere regarded as an indiscretion in Bettina, is only an evidence of her acute sensibility, and of course of her elevation
            of character. Almost all highly civilized communities regard the repression of sensibility as a moral duty, the Germans alone consider its constant exercise as the strongest test
            of true virtue; and there is as much evil in the code which
            enforces its suppression as in that which inculcates its exposition.
         </p>
         
         <p>We can make direct rules of conduct, based upon the immutable laws of duty to God and justice to man, but we can
            make no such regulation for the emotions. We have no
            right to make sensibility a duty. To some few it may be an
            unconditional privilege,--to many it is a penance, willingly
            endured for the sake of some concomitant blessing--to most of
            us it is a clinging curse. The dry, hard, unsympathising
            individual, who is virtuous from calculation, and treads his
            narrow path without ever looking down upon the flowers beneath his feet, or upward to the stars above his head, may
            often perform his duties in life better than the tender, susceptible being, who is ever stepping aside in kindness, or at least
            forgetting to keep a steady eye to the distant goal. If the
            world were made up of persons who think and feel, rather
            than act, (and such are persons of susceptibility,) how many
            more projects of good would be conceived, but how few
            would ever be accomplished! God be praised, that sensibility is not a duty. The curse would be too heavy for frail humanity if we had all been called to endure the burden of sensibility as well as the weight of labor. We are doomed to
            eat our bread in the sweat of our brow, not in the sweat of
            our hearts; and how comparatively merciful is the dispensation, those only know who have felt the double curse of a
            grief-worn spirit in a toil-worn frame.
         </p>
         
         <p>Yet while we regard 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span> as only very German in her
            girlishness, we have less respect for the sexagenarian coquetry of 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>. He evidently likes the passionate tone of
            her letters, he rather encourages her little petulant jealousies.
            Sometimes he checks her vehemence, but in such a manner
            that he approves, even while he seems to chide. Sometimes
            he praises her descriptive powers, sometimes sends her back
            her own sentiments embalmed in his verse, and sometimes
            calls forth all the vividness and warmth of devotion, by his
            eloquent appreciation. Had this affection grown up when
            
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>was twenty years younger, it would have been numbered among the many similar testimonies to his attractiveness which he was always proud to remember. But coming
            as it did, when he had already attained to old age, it had an
            importance iunhis eyes which called forth especial indulgence.
            The man whom Ninon honored with her favors after she had
            counted her eightieth year, would probably have been less
            fortunate had he been her lover forty years earlier.
         </p>
         
         <p>Compared with 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span>. 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span> was indeed a child, but
            the poet had not read the human heart in vain, and he well
            knew the probable result of such waste of devotion. The
            danger was not to virtue, not to good name,--it was the
            heart's unsullied purity that was risked. There was no
            outward wrong; no sacrifice was duty; but was it nothing
            to accept that first outpouring of tenderness? nothing to have
            awakened the first blush of the soul? Nothing to have stolen the dewy freshness of the heart's first fruits? How easy
            would it have been for 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> to have directed aright all the
            overflowing fullness of 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span>'s nature, to have guided her
            enthusiasm, repressed her passionateness, weeded out her
            jealousy, and, in short, to have raised her above the blind
            idolatry which made her to bow down before the priest, instead of worshipping the divinity at whose shrine he ministered! But the tact was, that in spite of all his greatness of
            mind, 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> was fully sensible of the pleasures of gratified
            vanity. He valued 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Benina</span>'s adoration, as any other man
            would have done, and perhaps, in expecting him to have re
            pelled the votary who brought such costly gifts, we ask more
            stoic virtue than falls to the lot of even the highest humanity.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nothing is more evident in this singular correspondence,
            than the difference between the hopeful fervor of youth and
            the back-looking yearning of age. It is the same difference
            as that which exists between the newly gathered blossom,
            and the spectral rose which the chemist's almost magical
            skill can bring out from the flower. 
            <span class="person" id="jwvgoethe">Goethe</span> could call up the
            faded and ghastly image from the crucible of memory, but
            the fresh garland which 
            <span class="person" id="bvarnim">Bettina</span> offered, must be consumed
            in the mystic process.

         <div class="biblPage">228</div>
         <div class="head">A RARE COLLECTION OF POLYGLOTT BIBLES.</div>
         
         <p>We had the pleasure of inspecting, a few days since, a rare
            collection of Polyglott Bibles, which has been made in Europe, at a great expense, by Bartlett and Welford, the wellknown booksellers of this city, for John Carter Brown, Esq.,
            of Providence, one of the most liberal patrons of literature
            and learning in the United States. His father, the late Hon.
            Nicholas Brown, the founder of Brown University, was one of
            the most munificent patrons of learning, as well as one of the
            greatest philanthropists, that our country has produced.
            There is hardly less credit due to the intelligent booksellers
            through whose agency this collection has been made, than to
            the liberal patron of literature for whose use they are intended.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most remarkable in this remarkable collection, as
            a literary and Biblical curiosity, is undoubtedly the splendid and truly celebrated work usually called the Complutensian Polyglott, from the place where it was printed. It occupies six folio volumes. The first four comprise the Old Testament, with the Hebrew, Latin, and
            Greek in distinct columns, the Chaldee paraphrase and
            Latin interpretation being at the bottom of the page. The
            fifth volume contains the Greek Testament, with the Vulgate
            Latin version and a Concordance. The sixth, a Hebrew and
            Chaldaic vocabulary, with other philological treatises. The
            accomplished author of the history of Ferdinand and Isabella,
            thus speaks of this great work:
         </p>
         
         <p>"In the midst of his pressing duties, Cordinal Ximenes found time
            for the execution of another work, which would alone have been sufficient to render his name immortal in the republic of letters. This was
            his famous Bible, the Complutensian Polyglott. It was on the plan,
            first conceived by Origen, of exhibiting in one view, the Scriptures in
            their various languages. It was a work of surpassing diffiulty, demanding an extensive and critical acquaintance with the most ancient, and
            consequently the rarest manuscripts. The character and station of the
            Cardinal afforded him, it is true, uncommon facilities. The precious
            edition of the Vatican was thrown open to him, especially under Leo
            X., whose munificent spirit delighted in the undertaking. He obtained
            copies, in like manner, of whatever was of value in the other libraries
            of Italy, and, indeed, of Rurope generally; and Spain supplied him
            with editions of the Old Testament of great antiquity, which has been
            treasured up by the banished Israelites."
         </p>
         
         <p>The conduct of the work was entrusted to nine scholars,
            well skilled in the ancient tongues. After the labors of the
            day, these learned sages were accustomed to meet, in order
            to settle the doubts and difficulties which had arisen in the
            course of their researches, and, in short, to compare the result of their observations. Ximenes was an excellent Biblical critic, frequently presided, and took a prominent part in
            these deliberations. "Lose no time, my friends," he would
            say, "in the prosecution of our glorious work, lest in the
            casualties of life, you should lose your patron, or I have to
            lament the loss of those whose services are of more price in
            ray eyes than wealth and worldly honors."
         </p>
         
         <p>The difficulties of the undertaking were sensibly increased
            by those of the printing. The art was then in its infancy,
            and there were no types in Spain, if indeed in any part of
            Europe, in the oriental character. Ximenes, however, careful to have the whole executed under his own eye, imported
            artists from Germany, and had types cast in the various languages required in his foundries at Alcala. The Cardinal
            declared to his friends when the work was completed,
            "that of all the acts which distinguished his administration,
            there was none, however arduous, better entitled to their
            congratulation than this."
         </p> 
         
         <p>This work was commenced in 1502, and completed in 1517.
            It cost Cardinal Ximenes 50,000 ducats, besides which
            4000 gold crowns were spent in procuring seven MSS.
            received too late for use. It is indeed a treasure to have
            in one's possession a work like this, published by the great
            Prime-Minister of Spain, under the especial patronage
            of its sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella, aided, too, by that
            patron of literature, Pope Leo the Tenth.
         </p>
         
         <p>Three copies of this Bible were printed on vellum. One is
            in the Royal Library at Madrid, another in the Royal Library at Turin; the third, supposed to have belonged to Cardinal Ximenes--passed through several hands, and was sold at
            auction in Paris in 1817 for £676 3s. 4d., about $3350.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second Polyglott in this collection is that known as
            the Antwerp Polyglott, in eight folio volumes. It is in four
            languages, viz: Hebrew, Chaldee, Greek and Latin, with a
            Chaldee paraphrase of part of the Old Testament, which
            Cardinal Ximenes suppressed in the Complutensian; also a
            Syriac version of the New Testament, and copious lexicons
            and grammers of each language. Five hundred copies only
            of this Bible were printed, the greater part of which were
            lost in a voyage to Spain. It was published at Amsterdam
            between 1569 and 1572.
         </p>
         
         <p>The third in order is the Paris Polyglott in seven languages, viz: Hebrew, Samaritan, Chaldee, Greek, Syriac,
            Latin and Arabic. It was commenced in 1628, and finished
            in 1645, and occupies ten very large folio volumes. The
            Samaritan Pentateuch was first printed in this Polyglott,
            from MSS. brought into Europe between 1610 and 1630 under the care of the learned Morinus.
         </p>
         
         <p>The fourth, is the Polyglott of Elias Hutter, published at
            Nuremberg in 1599, in three volumes. This is in six languages, Hebrew, Chaldee, Greek, Latin, the German version
            of Luther, and the Sclavonic version of Wittemberg. The
            Old Testament was never completed, and extends to the end
            of Ruth. It was a work of great value to the Biblical critic,
            and is as rare as either of the larger Polyglotts. Hutter also
            published the New Testament in twelve languages, viz:
            Syriac, Hebrew, Greek, Italian, Spanish, French, Latin, German, Bohemian, Danish, and Polish. All these several
            translations are presented to the eye at once on opposite
            pages.
         </p>
         
         <p>The last of the great Bibles in this collection is the National Polyglott of England, by Brian Walton, published in
            London in 1657. Nine languages are used in this edition;
            yet there is no one book in the whole Bible printed in so many. In the New Testament the four Evangelists are in six
            languages; the other books in five. Every sheet of this Bible
            exhibits at one view, 1st. The Hebrew text with the Latin
            version of Montanus. 2d. The same in the Vulgate Latin.
            3d. The Greek version of the Septuagint, with a Latin translation and the various readings of the Alexandrian MSS.
            4th. The Syriac version and Latin translation. 5th. The
            Targum and Chaldee paraphrase of Onkelos with a Latin
            translation. 6th. The Hebrew-Samaritan text and the Samaritan version, with a Latin translation. 7th. The Arabic
            version and Latin translation. The New Testament parts
            contain, besides others, the Perzic and Ethiopic versions.
         </p>
         
         <p>Bishop Walton was assisted in this great work by several
            scholars well verted in the Oriental languages. "It was
            published," says Dr. Horne, "under the patronage of Oliver
            Cromwell, who dying before it was finished, Bishop Walton
            cancelled two leaves of the preface, in which he had made
            honorable mention of his patron; and others were printed
            containing compliments to Charles II., and some pretty severe invectives against the republicans. Hence, has arisen
            the distinction between republican and loyal copies. Biblical
            critics all agree in opinion, that the London Polyglott of Walton is unquestionably the most valuable of either of the great
            Polyglotts of France, Holland or Spain. It has the advantage of being printed later than either, and contains the most
            important part of them all. Dr. 
            <span class="person" id="thhorne">Horne</span>, 
            <span class="person" id="tfdibdin">Dibdin</span> and other
            writers on Bibliography, give short accounts of these several
            Bibles, but fuller particulars may be found in Dr. 
            <span class="person" id="aclarke">Clarke</span>'s
            Bib. Dic., and the Memoirs of Bishop 
            <span class="person" id="bwalton">Walton</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p>An important work accompanies these Polyglotts, which
            was prepared and published to aid the student in a more critical study of the various languages in which they appear.
            This is 
            <span class="person" id="ecastell">Castell</span>'s Lexicon Heptaglotton, in 2 vols., folio, 1669,
            containing all the words in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac,
            Samaritan, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Persian found in the great
            polyglott Bibles. "This," says the learned Dr. 
            <span class="person" id="aclarke">Clarke</span>, "is
            probably the greatest and most perfect work of the kind ever
            performed by human industry and learning. Dr. 
            <span class="person" id="ecastell">Castell</span>expended both his fortune and his life in this immense undertaking. It is true, he had help from several learned men,
            among whom were Bishop Beveridge and Dr. Lightfoot.
            He labored at this work for seventeen years, during which
            time he maintained in his own house, at his own cost, seven
            Englishmen, and seven foreigners, as writers, all of whom
            died before the work was finished. The names of those respectable drudges, I have been unable to find." After spending 90,000 dollars on the work, he was obliged to solicit aid
            from Charles II. This produced a letter from the king in 1660,
            to all the archbishops, bishops, and nobility of the realm, recommending the work, and earnestly soliciting pecuniary
            assistance in behalf of its distinguished and embarrassed author. "Three years after, the archbishop of Canterbury
            directed a letter to the clergy on the subject, which was followed by others from twenty-nine English and Irish prelates,
            entreating the public not to permit this great man to sink
            under his labors and pecuniary embarrassments, brought on
            him by a work which he had undertaken for the honor of
            God, the promotion of religion and learning, and consequentthe good of mankind."
         </p>
         
         <p>In the collection of Mr. Brown are ten other polyglott Bibles, and versions of the Scriptures, of less note, though of
            considerable importance to the biblical student.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is also a copy of the celebrated Babylonian Talmud,
            in 12 volumes, folio, the whole in Hebrew text. This consists of the ancient Talmud, and the commentaries on the
            same by various Rabinical writers from the earliest period.
         </p>
         
         <p>It may be well to add that the whole of the books alluded
            to are sumptuously bound in Russia or Morocco, and in the
            most elegant and costly manner. The binding was executed
            by Mr. Walker and Mr. Daniel McLeod, and surpasses any
            thing of the kind we have seen in New York.

         <div class="biblPage">229</div>
         <div class="head">ANASTATIC PRINTING.</div>
         
         <p>It is admitted by every one that of late there has been a
            rather singular invention, called Anastatic Printing, and that
            this invention may possibly lead, in the course of time, to
            some rather remarkable results--among which the one chiefly
            insisted upon, is the abolition of the ordinary stereotyping
            process but this seems to be the amouut, in America at
            least, of distinct understanding on this subject.
         </p>
         
         <p>"There is no exquisite beauty," says 
            <span class="person" id="fbacon">Bacon</span>, "without
            some strangeness in the proportions." The philosopher had
            reference, here, to beauty in its common acceptation--but
            the remark is equally applicable to all the forms of beauty-that is to say, to every thing which arouses profound interest
            in the heart or intellect of man. In every such thing, strangeness--in other words novelty--will be found a principal element; and so universal is this law that it has no exception
            even in the case of this principal element itself. Nothing,
            unless it be novel--not even novelty itself--will be the source
            of very intense excitement among men. Thus the ennuyé
            who travels in the hope of dissipating his ennui by the perpetual succession of novelties, will invariably be disappointed
            in the end. He receives the impression of novelty so continuously that it is at length no novelty to receive it. And
            the man, in general, of the nineteenth century--more especially of our own particular epoch of it--is very much in the
            predicament of the traveller in question. We are so habituated to new inventions, that we no longer get from newness
            the vivid interest which should appertain to the new--and
            no example could be adduced more distinctly showing that
            the mere importance of a novelty will not suffice to gain for
            it universal attention, than we find in the invention of Anastatic Printing. It excites not one fiftieth part of the comment which was excited by the comparatively frivolous invention of Sennefelder;--but he lived in the good old days
            when a novelty was a novel. Nevertheless, while Lithography opened the way for a very agreeable pastime, it is
            the province of Anastatic Printing to revolutionize the world.
         </p>
         
         <p>By means of this discovery any thing written, drawn, or
            printed, can be made to stereotype itself, with absolute accuracy, in five minutes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Let us take, for example, a page of this Journal; supposing only one side of the leaf to have printing on it. We
            dampen the leaf with a certain acid diluted, and then place
            it between two leaves of blotting-paper to absorb superfluous
            moisture. We then place the printed side in contact with a
            zinc plate that lies on the table. The acid in the interspaces
            between the letters, immediately corrodes the zinc, but the
            acid on the letters themselves, has no such effect, having
            been neutralized by the ink. Removing the leaf at the end
            of five minutes, we find a reversed copy, in slight relief, of
            the printing on the page--in other words, we have a stereotype plate, from which we can print a vast number of absolute fac-similes of the original printed page--which latter
            has not been at all injured in the process--that is to say, we
            can still produce from it (or from any impression of the stereotype plate) new stereotype plates ad libitum. Any engraving, or any pen and ink drawing, or any MS. can be stereotyped in precisely the same manner.
         </p>
         
         <p>The facts of this invention are established. The process
            is in successful operation both in London and Paris. We
            have seen several specimens of printing done from the plates
            described, and have now lying before us a leaf (from the
            London Art-Union) covered with drawing, MS., letter-press,
            and impressions from wood-cuts--the whole printed from the
            Anastatic stereotypes, and warranted by the Art-Union to be
            absolute facsimiles of the originals.
         </p>
         
         <p>The process can scarcely be regarded as a new invention-and appears to be rather the modification and successful application of two or three previously ascertained principles--
            those of etching, electography, lithography, etc. It follows
            from this that there will be much difficulty in establishing or
            maintaining a right of patent, and the probability is that the
            benefits of the process will soon be thrown open to the world.
            As to the secret--it can only be a secret in name.
         </p>
         
         <p>That the discovery (if we may so call it) has been made,
            can excite no surprise in any thinking person--the only matter for surprise is, that it has not been made many years ago.
            The obviousness of the process, however, in no degree lessens its importance. Indeed its inevitable results enkindle
            the imagination, and embarrass the understanding.
         </p>
         
         <p>Every one will perceive, at once, that the ordinary process of stereotyping will be abolished. Through this ordinary
            process, a publisher, to be sure, is enabled to keep on hand
            the means of producing edition after edition of any work the
            certainty of whose sale will justify the cost of stereotyping-which is trifling in comparison with that of re-setting the
            matter. But still, positively, this cost (of stereotyping) is
            great. Moreover, there cannot always be certainty about
            sales. Publishers frequently are forced to re-set works which
            they have neglected to stereotype, thinking them unworthy
            the expense; and many excellent works are not published at
            all, because small editions do not pay, and the anticipated
            sales will not warrant the cost of stereotype. Some of these
            difficulties will be at once remedied by the Anastatic Printing, and all will be remedied in a brief time. A publisher
            has only to print as many copies as are immediately demanded. He need print no more than a dozen, indeed, unless he
            feels perfectly confident of success. Preserving one copy, he
            can from this, at no other cost than that of the zinc, produce
            with any desiarble rapidity, as many impressions as he may
            think proper. Some idea of the advantages thus accruing
            may be gleaned from the fact that in several of the London
            publishing warehouses there is deposited in stereotype plates
            alone, properly to the amount of a million sterling.
         </p>
         
         <p>The next view of the case, in point of obviousness, is, that
            if necessary, a hundred thousand impressions per hour, or
            even infinitely more, can be taken of any newspaper, or similar publication. As many presses can be put in operation as
            the occasion may require:--indeed there can be no limit to the
            number of copies producible, provided we have no limit to
            the number of presses.
         </p>
         
         <p>The tendency of all this to cheapen information, to diffuse
            knowledge and amusement, and to bring before the public
            the very class of works which are most valuable, but least
            in circulation on account of unsaleability--is what need
            scarcely be suggested to any one. But benefits such as these
            are merely the immediate and most obvious--by no means
            the most important.
         </p>
         
         <p>For some years, perhaps, the strong spirit of conventionality--of conservatism--will induce authors in general to have
            recourse, as usual, to the setting of type. A printed book,
            now, is more sightly, and more legible than any MS. and for
            some years the idea will not be overthrown that this state of
            things is one of necessity. But by degrees it will be remembered that, while MS. was a necessity, men wrote after such
            fashion that no books printed in modern times have surpassed their MSS. either in accuracy or in beauty. This consideration will lead to the cultivation of a neat and distinct style
            of handwriting--for authors will perceive the immense advantage of giving their own MSS. directly to the public
            without the expensive interference of the type-setter, and the
            often ruinous intervention of the publisher. All that a man
            of letters need do, will be to pay some attention to legibility
            of MS. arrange his pages to suit himself, and stereotype them
            instantaneously, as arranged. He may intersperse them with
            his own drawings, or with anything to please his own fancy,
            in the certainty of being fairly brought before his readers,
            with all the freshness of his original conception about him.
         </p>
         
         <p>And at this point we are arrested by a consideration of infinite moment, although of a seemingly shadowy character.
            The cultivation of accuracy in MS., thus enforced, will tend
            with an irresistible impetus to every species of improvement
            in style--more especially in the points of concision and distinctness--and this again, in a degree even more noticeable,
            to precision of thought, and luminous arrangement of matter.
            There is a very peculiar and easily intelligible reciprocal influence between the thing written and the manner of writing
            --but the latter has the predominant influence of the two.
            The more remote effect on philosophy at large, which will
            inevitably result from improvement of style and thought in
            the points of concision, distinctness, and accuracy, need only
            be suggested to be conceived.
         </p>
         
         <p>As a consequence of attention being directed to neatness
            and beauty of MS. the antique profession of the scribe
            will be revived, affording abundant employment to women-their delicacy of organization fitting them peculiarly for such
            tasks. The female amanuensis, indeed, will occupy very
            nearly the position of the present male type-setter, whose industry will be diverted perforce into other channels.
         </p>
         
         <p>These considerations are of vital importance--but there is
            yet one beyond them all. The value of every book is a compound of its literary value and its physical or mechanical
            value as the product of physical labor applied to the physical
            material. But at present the latter value immensely predominates, even in the works of the most esteemed authors.
            It will be seen, however, that the new condition of things
            will at once give the ascendancy to the literary value, and
            thus by their literary values will books come to be estimated
            among men. The wealthy gentleman of elegant leisure will
            lose the vantage ground now afforded him, and will be forced
            to tilt on terms of equality with the poor devil author. At
            present the literary world is a species of anomalous Congress,
            in which the majority of the members are constrained to listen in silence while all the eloquence proceeds from a privileged few. In the new regime, the humblest will speak as
            often and as freely as the most exalted, and will be sure of
            receiving just that amount of attention which the intrinsic
            merit of their speeches may deserve.
         </p>
         
         <p>From what we have said it will be evident that the discovery of Anastatic Printing will not only not obviate the
            necessity of copy-right laws, and of an International Law in
            especial, but will render this necessity more imperative and
            more apparent. It has been shown that in depressing the
            value of the physique of a book, the invention will proportionally elevate the value of its morale, and since it is the latter
            value alone which the copy-right laws are needed to protect,
            the necessity of the protection will be only the more urgent
            and more obvious than ever.

         </div>
         
         
         <p>I will confess myself, at the threshold of my narrative,
            an American author, but not a member of the "American
            Authors' Union," which is not an e pluribus unum. My obligations of secresy to the members will not allow me to make
            a revelation of my own or of their names, even though other
            motives did not compel me to observe a strict incognito. It
            will be enough for my readers to know that "publishers are
            fattening on the heart's blood" of such as I and my associates,
            to see the propriety of withholding names. The note addressed to O K, which stands for all concerned, was taken
            from the Sun office by one of "several authors," in a mask.
            As the courageous member of the union who had undertaken
            the perilous task of fetching the note of Areanus, turned the
            corner of Fulton street, with the mysterious missive in his
            hand, he narrowly escaped the fangs of an emissary from
            Cliff street, and near Ann street, as he ran panting through
            the crowd, came near falling into the merciless clutches of a
            pale looking gentleman with greedy black eyes, who had
            scented him from Broadway. But his mask, his haste, the
            crowd in the streets, a pea-nut waggon on the side-walk,
            a new caricature with its crowd of admirers, an apple-stall,
            a stream of water from a hydrant, a heap of mud on the
            crossing, and a little bare-footed girl begging for a penny, all
            helped to favor the escape of the "one of many authors,"
            who in his fright burst into a dining-saloon, not with any
            intent of dining, for he had already eaten his daily three
            dough-nuts, and drank his eleemosynary glass of water at a
            cheap bakery in Gold street, but because he knew that no
            publisher would dream of hunting for an author in a diningsaloon. As he threw himself upon a bench, and tore the mask
            from his face, his heart beat terribly, his face was paler than
            death, but a sudden flush overspread his wan cheeks and
            his lofty brow, as he exultingly exclaimed, (to himself be it
            observed for he had the organ of caution too largely developed to betray himself by exclaiming aloud,) "no rapacious
            publisher shall fatten on this heart's blood!"
         </p>
         
         <p>Driven to the verge of despair by the exciting odor of a
            sirloin steak which was inhumanly placed on a table near
            him, with dreadful apprehensions of some rapacious publisher
            watching for him in the street, grasping his cloak firmly in
            his hand, and assuming a look of fierce contempt for all
            around him, he again sallied into the perilous highway. He
            looked cautiously into Ann street He threaded the suspicious crowds of Nassau street, until he reached----; here
            he stopped at the door of a wild and fantastic looking building,
            numbered --, and casting a hurried glance around him, he
            suddenly disappeared. I had watched him narrowly, and
            followed close upon his heels without being perceived by
            him, and darting through the door which he had entered, at
            the head of a high flight of stairs, another door opened, and
            I suddenly found myself in the presence of Several Authors.
         </p>
         
         <p>As he entered they all exclaimed "Areanus!".</p>
         
         <p>Depositing his hat and cloak solemnly upon a bench he drew
            the letter from his pocket, and read as follows.--But before I
            give the contents of the letter, it will be better to record a
            debate which occurred among the authors present.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Dennis Deccus, a young American author, of a very
            common genius, one whom every body had heard of, but
            nobody had read, had spoken indignantly against publishers,
            and had made effective use of the thrilling fact that they
            were fattening on the heart's blood of authors.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I do not speak on my own account, gentlemen; nobody
            who knows me will accuse me of harboring in my breast the
            shadow of a selfish feeling, but the cause of American literature calls out to me in trumpet-tones that cannot be withstood; I am not selfish, gentlemen, I am not vain, I am not
            proud, I am not presumptuous, nor am I desirous of notoriety; but I am anxious to sell a large edition of my collected
            works for the benefit of my country. 
            <span class="person" id="wscott">Walter Scott</span> sold
            large editions of his works from mere selfishness, so has
            
            <span class="person" id="cdickens">Dickens</span>, and so have others; yet I, gentlemen, who am
            only desirous of elevating the better life of my country, cannot sell one paltry edition of my works, owing to the rapacity of publishers who are fattening on the heart's blood of
            American authors."
         </p>
         
         <p>Here another of the union jumped up very hastily, and said
            he disagreed with the gentleman in every thing that he had
            stated. "I will bet you my life," he exclaimed, passionately,
            "that I will demonstrate to the entire and perfect satisfaction of the gentleman himself that he is an ass and a fool.
            Not but that I have the highest opinion of the gentleman's
            talents, abilities, acquirements and genius; but I conceive
            that the interests of American literature are superior to so
            small a matter as the courtesies of life and my own regard
            for that gentleman, who, as a gentleman, a scholar, a poet,
            a man of the world, and an author in general, and above all
            an American author, and above and beyond all other considerations, one of several authors, I esteem highly and reverence deeply. But to be extremely short and concise, plain
            and curt, I must insist, I do insist, and I shall continue to insist, for the honor of American literature, that Mr. Dennis
            Deccus, is a fool, and, as I said before, do say now, and mean
            to say hereafter, an ass. In the very first sentence of the
            gentleman's speech, he made use of one false emphasis; two
            false pronunciations; three mixed metaphors; four low expressions, and five false facts, besides one gross mistake,
            which was neither one of these, but an error which partakes
            of the whole, namely a--------"
         </p>
         
         <p>"I would make one observation, gentlemen," said Mr.
            Janson Mintstick, rising with a quiet grace, "I have belonged
            to a great many societies in my time, indeed, I may say several societies, but I must confess, and I do it with a good
            deal of hesitation and reluctance, that I have never before
            heard a more ungentlemanly and unprovoked attack than
            that which one of these gentlemen has made on the other."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Do you mean me?" said Mr. Deccus with an angry scowl.</p>
         
         <p>"I do not sir."</p>
         
         <p>"Do you mean me?" demanded the other gentleman.</p>
         
         <p>"I do not sir. Are you satisfied gentlemen?"</p>
         
         <p>"Perfectly."</p>
         
         <p>"Perfectly."</p>
         
         <p>"I did not mean either of you, personally, but as an
            American author of the Author's Union. I trust that I have
            given no offence to any gentleman present, and I have no intention of making any insinuations against any author, but it
            appears to me very remarkable that in a discussion on American literature, and American authors, my name should
            not be mentioned, as every one must know that I have laid
            the corner stone of a national literature."
         </p>
         
         <p>A pale author now stood up, a remarkable contrast to the
            last speaker, who was short, fat, smiling, and glossy in his
            whole appearance.
         </p>
         
         <p>Every one seemed to experience a chilly feeling, as the pale
            author spoke, and I perceived before he sat down that he held
            an icicle in his hand which a person near me said was his
            stylus. "His verses," whispered the same person, "are as
            smooth, as clear, as glittering, but as cold as ice."
         </p>
         
         <p>The pale author looked very coldly at every body, but said
            not a word.
         </p>
         
         <p>"What is the meaning of his strange conduct," I asked,
            surely he does not belong to the genus irritabile?"
         </p>
         
         <p>"He surely does," replied my friend, "but with all the
            petulance of the tribe, and with the jealousy of a Turk, he
            lacks the passion necessary for abuse; so he makes use of the
            destructive powers which nature has given him, and freezes
            those whom he cannot strike. But he does sometimes strike,
            though always with the icicle which he carries in his
            hand."
         </p>
         
         <p>"I would sooner be stung by a hornet," said I, "than to
            be stabbed with an icicle."
         </p>
         
         <p>The icy poet having taken his seat with his face towards
            the north pole, another member rose with a joyous spring
            upon his feet, and looking round upon the audience with a
            countenance as warm and cheering as the sun, immediately
            put every body in a laughing humor, so that even the author
            with the frozen stylus smiled grimly without perceiving
            what he did.
         </p>
         
         <p>"For myself, I make no complaint," said the cheerful author who was a poet, "but I claim the privilege which I
            hope will not be denied me, of complaining in behalf of a
            much injured and suffering race; if my heart's blood has sufficient nutriment to fatten any human being, I will gladly part
            with it, even though it be to a publisher, for a publisher is a
            human being, and--"
         </p>
         
         <p>"That I deny," exclaimed a dozen voices together, among
            which the voice of Mr. Deccus was heard above all.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I grant you the liberty to deny it," continued the poet in
            the same pleasant tone, "but I deny your denial."
         </p>
         
         <p>"Observe sir," said another author whom I had not noticed
            before, "observe sir, my view of the case is peculiar. Without intending any discourtesy to any gentleman present, I will
            merely say, you observe I say it myself, that I differ from
            the whole of you. My friend Drivel, the American 
            <span class="person" id="jhogg">Hogg</span>,
            and my friend Deccus, the American 
            <span class="person" id="cdickens">Boz</span>, and my friend-whose name I forget at this moment, the American 
            <span class="person" id="hmackenzie">MacKenzie</span>, you observe, are well aware that the one great, leading, pervading, absorbing idea with us at the South is, that
            the race to which the gentleman alluded is"--
         </p>
         
         <p>"Perhaps the gentleman will wait until I say what race I
            meant," said the poet. "I will save him any further
            alarm by stating plainly that I meant the race of authors."
         </p>
         
         <p>"That is another matter," replied the author in a subdued
            tone, "observe I am an author myself, an American author,
            one of many authors, and as you will observe, I make it a
            point to fatten myself on the heart's blood of publishers, instead of allowing them to fatten on mine. It is a principle
            with me to compel publishers to pay me something, though
            it be but a shilling, for whatever I may do for them. You
            will observe that--"
         </p>
         
         <p>Here the door was opened by an alarmed author with a
            bundle of papers under his arm, whose entrance created a
            visible panic among the authors assembled.
         </p>
         
         <p>"I do not wish to frighten you, gentlemen," he said, "but
            I met a publisher as I came along, and I have a suspicion
            that he is watching for some of you. Look out for your
            heart's blood. At this intelligence, every body turned pale,
            excepting the pale poet, who was already as pale and as
            cold as he could be.
         </p>
         
         <p>The author who last entered, seemed less apprehensive
            for himself than for an author present, his friend, Mr. Deccus,
            whom he clasped in his arms and vowed to protect while
            there was life in his body. The "several authors" were beginning to rush out, when the friend of Mr. Deccus begged
            them to stay a moment longer, and hear him read a review
            of his friend's works which he had prepared for the Hong
            Kong Gazette, there being a great curiosity in China to know
            something about Deccus. It being the chief business of "several authors" to review each other, they all stopped without
            further urging, for the heart's blood is only another name for
            a review. The review was read, which we shall give hereafter, with the letter of Areanus, and the Union having resolved itself into a branch of the famous society for promoting mutual admiration, they stealthily withdrew to preserve
            their heart's blood from rapacious publishers.

            <br></br>By thy blighting gaze belied?
            
            <br></br>For thy words of praise are mocking,

            <br></br>When a flush of silent anger
            
            <br></br>Reveals thy jests have told.

            <p>The American Review for April announces that a body of
               the whig senators, including Messrs. Webster, Berrien, Mangum, Evans, Morehead, Crittenden, Archer, John M. Clayton, and several others, "have voluntarily consulted respecting its establishment, and pledged themselves to support it
               by monthly contributions--each engaging his attention for a
               month assigned." With assistance of such character Mr.
               
               <span class="person" id="ghcolton">Colton</span> cannot fail in securing a very eminent position for the
               Review, which, we are happy to know, is in other respects
               securely established.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first paper (in the number for April) we sincerely regret to see--nor can we see its necessity in any respect. Its
               subject is "The Last Chief Executive."
            </p>
            
            <p>The paper on Thiers' Revolution is somewhat too long for
               a Magazine article of so solid a character, but neither its discrimination nor its vigor can be doubted. "About Birds"
               and "Waltoniana" are both very amusing, and "How shall
               life be made the most of?" is full of admirable suggestion.
               "The Commercial Intercourse with Eastern Asia" is one of
               the most valuable (if not the most valuable) of all. With
               the exception of "Some Words with a Mummy" which had
               the misfortune to be written by "one of us," there is only
               one really bad article in the number--but that one is ineffable, and how the good taste of Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="ghcolton">Colton</span>could have admitted it, is a mystery. It is entitled "Sir Oracle," and seems
               to have been composed in a fit of spleen, amounting almost
               to mania, by some microscopical littérateur whose last effusion has been maltreated by the critics. We might, in fact,
               ascertain the author by finding out who, of late, has written
               the stupidest book. The gentleman thinks that all critics are
               "asses," and declares that "Greek shall meet Greek," ending with something about the Kilkenny cats. But it is impossible, without an extract, to convey any idea of the pitiable drivel of this essay. Here is a specimen. The author
               (who calls himself Nosmetipsi) is ridiculing the critical pretensions of some body whom he met at Washington. A conversation occupying three or four pages of "The American
               Review!" is detailed at length as follows--the writer pledging his word that he is "strictly faithful" in the account:
            </p>
            
            <p>N. "Well, don't you think Crittenden, Rives, Preston, and Buchanan are strong men?" C. "I guess they are! Ain't it fun to hear
               them great speakers?" N. "Oh, capital! There's Colonel Benton,
               too, a gentleman, and a great egotist." C. "Yes, sir; he's great any
               how." N. "He's the great author of the 'Gold Humbug.'" C. "So
               he is--a great author, very great, indeed." N. "But there's another
               Colonel, who has run for Lieutenant-General in the Loco army, but
               who is willing to serve as kettle-drum Major, or even to march in the
               'rank and file.' He is a great man; and, like a true soldier, has shown
               a deep attachment to the colors."  C. "Yes, he likes the colors, I tell
               ye, and he'll die by 'em." N. "But don't you think Wright, and
               Van Buren, and Tyler, and Polk are great men!" C. "Yes, sir, all
               of 'em; very great men." N. "The first, is the great Magician; the
               second,the Little Magician: the fourth, the Great Unknown." C.
               "Jest what I've often said, sir." N. "It seems to me, that we have
               more great men than we need. Isn't it a pity some three or four of
               them--for instance, Calhoun, Benton, and Van Buren--had not been
               born in other countries, to diffuse the blessings of 'progressive democracy?'" C. "I think it is now, a very great pity, very great, indeed. We could supply the world with Presidents, not to mention
               Vice-Presidents and Governors." N. "Yes, indeed. What a pity,
               too, that here and there one of our great men indulges too freely in
               unnatural excitements, instead of remaining strictly 'aquæ potator!
               You understand me?" "Oh, yes," said he, with great gravity, but
               eyeing us very closely. "Oh, certingly. Though I can't say I like
               to see men such very 'queer potatoes.' The greatest men, though,
               are always a leetle queer. But, queer or not, the men we've named
               ain't small potatoes, are they?" N. "No, sir, I consider them all to
               be large ones." C. "That they are, the thumpin'est kind of big ones,
               or else I don't know nothing about it." After a pause of about a minute, with a violent, but invisible and noiseless inward cachination, we
               said, "From your very remarkable taste and knowledge, I should hope
               you are a Loco--that is--a Democrat." C. "I ain't nothin' else, I
               guess." "That shows your judgment. All great men are Locos,
               'except six.'" C. "So I think. I s'pose you're a Loco, of course?"
               N. "I'm almost afraid to say, for fear you'd tell on me, if we should
               be beaten." C. "Indeed, I wouldn't, friend. I'm dark as a wolf's
               mouth." N. "Well, now, don't mention it. I'm a Whig, sir--a Whig
               now and always, here and everywhere." C. "The d--l, you are!
               Now, who'd have thought it? Wall, 'many men of many minds.'
               I'm not a very strong Democrat, myself. Henry Clay's a great man.
               very great, very great, indeed." N. "Yes, sir, too great for us to criticise, or for his country to appreciate. Good day, sir." C. "Why
               now, you ain't a-going a'ready? Take another cigar." N. "I thank
               you, sir. I have had sufficient enjoyment in 'smoking' the biped."
               And thus we parted,--he apparently pondering over the occult meaning of our last remark; and we thoroughly diverted at the ex cathedrá
               decisions of the fellow, who found his bliss not in his real ignorance,
               but in the dubious conceit that he was wise.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now this is seriously intended as satire on criticism in general. The whole article will put the reader in mind of the
               scratching, biting, kicking and squalling of a very fat little
               booby while getting flogged. For our own part, had we
               been editor of even the "Paul Pry," we should have rejected
               "Sir Oracle" as too undignified, and immensely too stupid for
               its columns. Such things seriously injure in degrading a
               Magazine.

            <div class="biblPage">235</div>
            <p>The Southern Literary Messenger, for April, has
               its usual array of good papers, and among them we notice in
               especial--"A brief Vindication of the Government and People of the United States from the Accusations brought against
               them by the Author of 'Letters and Notes on the Manners,
               Customs and Conditions of the North American Indians.
               Written during eight years' travel among the wildest tribes
               of Indians in North America. By 
               <span class="person" id="gcatlin">George Catlin</span>.'" Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="gcatlin">Catlin</span>'s book was published in 1841. The Vindication, etc. is,
               we think, from the pen of one of the ablest men in Virginia,
               and we have only to regret its terminating sentence.
            </p>
            
            <p>The review of Miss 
               <span class="person" id="ebbrowning">Barrett</span> will be well received by the
               unpoetical alone. The critic merely shows that her poetry
               is no poetry to him. She is unquestionably, in spite of her
               numerous faults, the most glorious woman of her age--
               the queen of all female poets.
            </p>
            
            <p>"The Carolinas During the Revolution," is the title
               of another very valuable article, the paternity of which we
               are quite at a loss to designate. There is also an original
               letter from Baron Von Washington, containing some interesting particulars respecting the Washington family.
            </p>
            
            <p>The poetry of the Messenger is not at all times equal to
               its prose--but in the present number we observe some very
               effective stanzas (The Child's Grave) by Mrs. 
               <span class="person" id="jtworthington">Jane Tayloe
                  Worthington
               </span>--also a sweet poem by Miss 
               <span class="person" id="mgwells">Mary G. Wells</span>.
               The Critical Notices are brief, and to the point--although in
               many particulars we disagree radically with the opinions of
               the critic. We should be inclined, for example, to think far
               more highly than he, of the "Vestiges of Creation." If not
               written by Dr. 
               <span class="person" id="jpnichol">Nichol</span>, this work is at least worthy that
               great man.

            <p>The Democratic Review has a characteristic article by
               
               <span class="person" id="nhawthorne">Hawthorne</span>,--a semi-critical essay in which he has prolonged

               sent all the living writers to the tomb, giving the imaginary
               obituaries which their decease would have elicited. There
               are several other good papers in the magazine, the best of
               which are an admirable disquisition on plagiarism, an essay

            <div class="biblPage">236</div>
            <p>Hunt's Merchant's Magazine contains the full amount
               of valuable statistical matter which we have been accustomed to find in its pages, but it contains one article, the spirit of
               which should, in some form, always be found in a work intended, like this, for the eye of the merchant. It is a review
               of 
               <span class="person" id="jdymond">Dymond</span>'s essays, but is called "Morals for Merchants,"
               which would be a startling term to those who did not know
               that the laws of the State, by interposing their authority between individuals in the adjustment of private claims, have
               created a mercantile immorality, and given rise to what are
               called debts of honor, which are generally the most dishonorable of all obligations, but which, being placed beyond the
               cognizance of statute law, are taken in charge by the law of
               honor. It is a subject of great astonishment that men will
               not learn from this anomalous class of debts, that if all debts
               were made debts of honor, there would be fewer debts unpaid
               than there are now. The present number of the Merchants'
               Magazine, contains an announcement, as a rare occurrence,
               that two merchants who had been legally released from their
               business obligations, had recently paid their debts with interest. What more need be said for the morals of a profession, when one of its members is publicly applauded for a
               simple act of honesty which the lowest gambler feels himself
               bound to perform. It is but a year or two since men who
               could not pay their debts, were shut up in prison, and now
               that we have left that barbarous practice behind us, so
               strange and unnatural does it seem, that we can hardly believe that the stuccoed temple in the Park has contained
               within its walls thousands of human beings, who were shut
               up in killing confinement, for no other cause than an inability
               to pay their debts.

         <div class="biblPage">236</div>
         <div class="head">THE ANTIGONE AT PALMO'S.</div>
         
         <p>Our readers are aware that the "Antigone" of Sophocles
            has been lately brought out at Berlin, at Paris, and at London. In the two former cities the success might be called
            decided, in the usual theatrical acceptation of the term--that
            is to say, the house was sufficiently full every night, and the
            nights of representation were sufficiently numerous to remunerate the management. At London there was less enthusiasm (whether true or false) and the announcement that the
            tragedy was there "performed with extraordinary success"
            must be swallowed cum grano salis:--the phrase, indeed, is
            by far too strong for either the Berlin or Parisian attempt.
         </p>
         
         <p>A thing of this kind is always a mere "attempt," and must
            necessarily so be--on account of its anomaly. We shall not
            pretend to enter into a discussion of the merits of "Antigone"
            as "Antigone" was written by 
            <span class="person" id="sophocles">Sophocles</span> and performed at
            Athens--we shall not do this for the simple reason that that
            "Antigone" is a matter about which we moderns happen to
            know nothing--the proof being, that no two of the scholiasts
            agree in any one point respecting it. Of the "Antigone" as
            we have it, there is really very little to say--although of that
            little the Germans, as usual-- Augustus William Schlegel  in
            particular--have contrived to make a very great deal of elocution. The tragedy, in all the elements of tragedy (as we,
            the moderns, comprehend it) is vastly inferior to any one of
            the dramas of Æschylus--and, perhaps, any play of Euripi
            des would have been more acceptable to a modern audience. But, apart from all this, there is about the "Antigone," as well as about all the ancient plays, an insufferable
            baldness, or platitude, the inevitable result of inexperience in
            Art--but a baldness, nevertheless, which pedantry would
            force us to believe the result of a studied and supremely artistic simplicity alone. Simplicity is, indeed, a very lofty
            and very effective feature in all true Art--but not the simplicity which we see in the Greek drama. The simplicity of
            the Greek sculpture is every thing that can be desired, because here the art in itself is simplicity in itself, and in its elements. The Greek sculptor chiselled his forms from what he
            saw before him every day, in a beauty far nearer to perfection than any work of any Cleomenes in the world. But in
            the drama, the direct--the straight forward, un-German Greek
            had no Nature so directly presented, from which to copy
            his conceptions. He did what he could--but that was exceedingly little worth. The profound sense of one or two
            tragic, or rather melo-dramatic elements (such as the idea of
            inexorable Destiny)--this sense, gleaming at intervals from
            out the darkness of the ancient stage, serves, in the imperfection of its development, to show not the dramatic ability,
            but the dramatic inability of the ancients. In a word, the
            simple arts spring into perfection, at their origin. The complex as inevitably demand the long and painfully progressive
            experience of ages.
         </p>
         
         <p>To the Greeks, beyond doubt, their drama seemed perfection--and this fact is absurdly urged as proof of their drama's
            perfection in itself. It need only be said, in reply, that their
            art and their sense of art must have been necessarily on a
            level.
         </p>
         
         <p>The idea of reproducing a Greek play before a modern audience, is the idea of a pedant and nothing beyond--that is to
            say, if the producer dreams of creating in the modern audience any real interest in the play. Of adventitious interest
            there will be of course, some little. Many persons will be
            curious to understand the mode in which the Greeks wrote
            dramas and performed them--but, alas! no person should go
            to  Palmo 's for such understanding. Others again will like it
            to be imagined that they have a scholastic taste, and could
            discourse learnedly on certain classical themes, if there
            were occasion. Others enjoy a good joke--and to all such
            we recommend the "Antigone" at Dinneford's theatre,
            which we take it for granted is fifty or sixty feet in diameter
            --none of the Greek theatres being more than six or seven
            hundred.
         </p>
         
         <p>We overheard Mr. Mitchell on the first night of the representation, plotting direful schemes in the way of burlesque-but we would suggest to him that such trouble is altogether
            superfluous. We are serious in saying that if, before the
            performance hud taken place at  Palmo 's, he had brought
            out the very "Autigone" brought out at  Palmo 's, with the
            understanding that it was meant for a burlesque on the play
            as produced at London or Berlin, it would have been received
            (as all his capital parodies are received) with shouts of rapturous laughter. The only modification he need have
            made, would have been the substitution of Holland for Vandenhoff, and De Bar for Miss  Clarendon . The latter, with
            Mr. V., (who is beyond doubt, a capital elocutionist) did all
            that could be done for the play--but what, in the name of
            common sense, was there to be done?
         </p>
         
         <p>We are really ashamed of having wasted so much space in
            commenting on this piece of folly. Had the "Antigone"
            been produced with all classical appliances--a monstrous
            folly still it would have been--but of the numerous schoolboys who were present on the opening night, there was not
            one who could have failed to laugh in his sleeve, at the medley of anachronisms--solecisms--sotlicisms--which rendered
            the whole affair an unintentional burlesque. On the first
            night, there was a very respectable attendance--on the
            second (very naturally) there were not a hundred paying spectators in the house.
         </p>
         
         <p>The most singular feature in the performance is, undoubtedly, the accompanying music.  Mendelssohn  must have
            been inspired when he conceived the plan; it was a bold and
            lofty flight, and one not to be carried out by an ordinary mind.
            He had many difficulties to contend with; his own natural
            style must be abandoned, and the cramped and unmelodious
            system of the Greek unisonious singing adopted. To preserve that distinctive character, and still render the music
            acceptable to modem ears, must have taxed the utmost ingenuity of the composer. But he has succeeded to a marvel-the music is Greek thought adapted into German. The chorusses are sung by male voices only; they are in a great
            measure sung in unison, but where they are harmonised, the
            harmonies seem to be the natural result of the inflections of
            the voice. The subject of every chorus is simple, unadorned
            and majestic; partaking of the varied character of the words;
            serious and reflective, grave and prophetic, spirited and triumphant, religious sentiment mingled with the overpowering awe which ever accompanies benighted superstition.
         </p>
         
         <p>We purpose speaking of this music in a separate paper,
            and shall therefore only make at present a few remarks
            upon its performance.
         </p>
         
         <p>The only excuse that can be offered for the miserable way
            in which the chorusses were executed, is the want of sufficient time to study them. But this excuse is, after all, no
            excuse to the public; they did not urge the manager to
            produce the tragedy in an imperfect state; on the contrary,
            they expected to witness a representation as near perfection
            as the means employed would admit; but instead of this,
            a large number of men are paraded upon the stage, scarcely
            one third of them singing correctly, while the other two
            thirds either do not sing at all, or vamp the words and music.
            The semi-chorus Oh Eros! one of the most beautiful compositions in the tragedy, was entirely ruined by the wretched
            manner in which it was executed. Indeed, the whole of
            the musical arrangements reflect but little credit upon Mr.
             Loder 's reputation as an energetic and skillful conductor. He
            certainly did all that a man could do, under the circumstances; but these circumstances had no right to exist. He should
            either have demanded sufficient time, or have refused to lend
            the guarantee of his well known fame to a performance
            which must disappoint the public expectation.

         <div class="head">ITALIAN OPERA.</div>
         
         <p>A word or two about Sig.  de Begnis ' plan for an Italian Opera next
            fall. First and foremost, we see by the daily papers be intends to engage a reinforcement of several first rate singers from Italy, to unite
            with the Pico and others already in this city--this is good, and we wish
            him success, of which there is little doubt, as the commissariat department is to be entirely reformed, without which, Italian Opera in this
            country must necessarily be short-lived. The sinews of war will be
            properly applied, and this, more than any thing else, will produce harmony, which is, after all, the heart and soul of music, and without
            which a healthy circulation of good feeling among the corps Operatique cannot exist.
         </p>
         
         <p>We hear that  Madame Pico  and Sanquirico, are warm coadjutors in
            the  Signor 's reformed system; but that Valtellina talks of leaving this
            country--well, then, if the  Signor  carries out his design of producing
            the  Don Giovanni  and Marriage de Figaso, of  Mozart , we must needs
            hare another Baritone or  Basso ; indeed, if Valtellina were to remain
            among us, we doubt whether he would perform in any but  Donizetti 's
            Operas, and would not give to any modern composer, good, bad or indifferent, the preference to Mozart . For our own parts we would fore
            go the Basso Serio, rather than the Don Giovanni and Marriage de Figaro, which last, requires a stronger cast than any Opera hitherto produced here. The plan altogether is entitled to the patronage of the
            cognoscenti, who maybe sure that if any one can produce the above
            chefs d'ceuvres, it is De Begnis , for he has done the same in London, Ed inburgh, Liverpool, Dublin, and many other cities. "I Capuleti e
            Montechi," one of  Bellini 's best Operas (and well suited for Madame
            Pico,) and " Don Pasquale ," are among the Operas in contemplation.

            <div class="biblPage">237</div>
            <p>First Lessons for the Piano-forte--being a selection of beautiful and easy airs by Rossini , Auber , Herold , Labarre and Bellini . Arranged and fingered by  J. B. Duvernay . In Four Books. The first Book
               contains two beautiful and spirited Melodies in C, by  Auber , from
                Gustavus , we believe. They are carefully and copiously fingered,
               which renders them acceptable to young players. Book two, contains
               also two Airs; one by  Auber , the other from the Prè Aux Clerc, by
               the lamented  Herold , which cannot fail to prove highly attractive.--
               They are carefully fingered. Book three. The two Airs in this book
               are by  Rossini  and  Auber ; the one we think from Guilliame Tell, and
               the other the Cachuchs. The latter is so easily arranged, that the
               merest child could play it with pleasure to itself. It is also copiously
               fingered. Book four, contains themes by  Labarre  and  Bellini ; the
               one is a very chaste and flowing Air, and the other is the famous Suoni
               la Trombe from  I. Puritani . This book will certainly be a favorite
               with our young friends.
            </p>
            
            <p>We can recommend these books to our readers, as admirably calculated to please and improve the beginner in music. One of the most
               distinctive points in a good teacher is the art he displays in amusing
               the student, while dragging him through the elementary portion of the
               study. These little pieces will prove of considerable value both to
               the teacher and the pupil, and will meet with a steady and extensive
               sale.
            </p>
            
            <p>African Quadrilles, selected from the most admired Negro Melodies, and arranged for the Piano-forte by  J. C Scherpf , Professor of
               the piano and guitar. Mr.  Scherpf  has rendered the popular airs  Lucy
               Neal ,  Lucy Long , De Ole Gray Goose,  Cynthia Sue , and Ole Aunt  Sally ,
               into very dancible tunes. As quadrilles they are really very pleasing,
               and the arrangement is quite easy of execution. There are certain crudities which we forbear to notice upon the present occasion.
            </p>
            
            <p>Bohemian Waltzes--arranged for the Piano-forte, from favorite airs
               of  Balfe 's celebrated Opera of the Bohemian Girl, and dedicated to
               Mrs.  S. A. P. Bull , by  J. C. Scherpf .
            </p>
            
            <p>We must protest against the absurdity of turning operatic themes
               into waltzes; it is an outrage upon the composer, who sees his ideas
               destroyed by change of time, accent and sentiment. However, as the
               public wills that composers shall be hashed up to satisfy its morbid
               appetite, we have to submit, and in the present instance, we must
               compliment Mr.  Scherpf , who acts as chef de cuisine, for the clever
               way in which he has disguised the form and preserved the flavor.
            </p>
            
            <p>We met and we parted for ever,--a ballad, arranged and dedicated to
               his friend Mr.  A. B. Rich , by  E. Howe . Jr. This ballad is simple and
               unpretending in its character; it may be called pretty, but it is so
               trifling as to offer no point for criticism, the more so as it is said to be
               arranged and not composed. The words are extremely sweet and pathetic. We do not know who is the author, but we met with them
               many years since in an English Magazine.

            <div class="ab">STODART &amp;  DUNHAM 'S PIANO FORTE MANUFACTORY</div>
            
            <p>In noticing this establishment, we are only carrying out a design
               which we have contemplated several years. We have commenced our
               series of notices at the factory of Stodart &amp; Dunham, for the simple
               reason that it is not only one of the largest, but also one of the best
               conducted establishments in the city, and that every opportunity was
               afforded us of observation in every department, to enable us to become
               perfectly familiar with the subject of which we were about to treat.
               Every Piano Forte Manufactory must, of course, possess in a larger
               or smaller degree, all the departments which we have already mentioned besides those which we have yet to mention, but, as we had to
               begin somewhere, we selected, without any party intention, or feeling
               of undue preference, that one which afforded us the largest facilities of
               observation. Our other friends will please, therefore, to patiently
               "bide their time," in full assurance that even-handed justice will be
               done to them.
            </p>
            
            <p>But to proceed with our description. The next room we enter after
               passing from the Veneer room is the
            </p>
            
            <p>Sounding Board Room, or as it is technically called the Belly-man's
               Room. Here the interior of the instrument is inserted. The sounding
               board is fitted, the scale is fixed, the pins inserted, ready for stringing,
               and when strung, the action is put in and the instrument is ready to
               pass into the hands of the finisher. We do not exaggerate when we
               state, that to render even comparative justice to our subject, a whole
               number of our journal would scarcely afford a sufficient space. There
               are so many points of interest, minute in themselves, and still so beautiful in their mechanical fitness, that it is with great difficulty that we
               refrain from describing them.
            </p>
            
            <p>The key-board is also made in this room, and its manufacture is exceedingly interesting, being made of many pieces of wood firmly
               glued together, forming one solid block. It will doubtless have been
               observed by all those who have examined the action of the piano, that
               the keys are not all straight; some having a slight, while others have
               a considerable inclination from the straight line. The mathematical
               exactness with which these curvatures are obtained, is secured by a
               correct diagram, from which the solid key-board is marked out. The
               ivories, after having been duly cut to the exact size, are then glued
               firmly on, and when perfectly dry and secure, each key is separately
               sawed off from the solid board. Then comes the process of boring and
               poising the weight, to ensure the just balance and necessary lever.
               This is a very important portion of the manufacture, as may well be
               imagined, for the slightest error in the calculation would be fatal to
               the action of the individual key in relation to the whole.
            </p>
            
            <p>The number of instruments completed and in the course of completion, is truly surprising; we will not hazard a guess, but every room
               exhibits a large number in every stage, and the aggregate amount
               must be of immense value.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Action Room, which opens into the one of which we have been
               treating, exhibits, probably, the most interesting process of the whole
               establishment. Here the hammers, hammer-butts, flanges, levers,
               and dampers are made. These we shall not attempt to describe,
               for they are composed of so many small pieces, distinguished by such
               hard technical names, and dependent each upon the other for complete and simultaneous action, that we being somewhat mystified our.
               selves, can scarcely hope to be able to place a lucid explanation before our readers. The construction of the hammers is very beautiful
               as a piece of mechanism, and is highly interesting when explained as
               clearly as it was to us, by our friend  Adam Stodart , whose intimate
               knowledge of the minutest portion of the instrument must be the result of many, many years' practical experience. The improvements in
               the mechanical action of this portion of the instrument within our
               memory, is very marked. We shall not attempt to describe the ancient plan, as the explanation must be purely technical, but we can
               say truly, that it was clumsy, ill-contrived and inadequate to the purpose; while the modern improvements are perfectly adapted, and
               have worked an entire change in the interior arrangements, not only
               as regards the action, but also in the touch and tone.
            </p>
            
            <p>We have now gone through the whole of the prominent department
               in the manufacture of Piano-fortes, with the exception of the finishing,
               flyfinishing, and regulating rooms. There are many minor departments, which are equally interesting. These we shall notice in a future number.
            </p>
            
            <p>Our description of the manufacture of Piano-fortes, must be taken
               generally, for, although there are few establishments in the country
               as extensive as this, the principles are, of course, universal in the business. Each maker has his peculiar method, resulting from experience, of arriving at the desired end, but the end of all is the same,
               whatever means may be taken to insure it.
            </p>
            
            <p>When we have placed our Piano complete before the public, we
               shall proceed to discuss the excellences which Messrs.  Stodart  and
                Dunham  have succeeded in imparting to the instruments which bear
               their name; and shall also notice other dealers, whose instruments
               we can conscientiously recommend to out readers.

            <p>Cole has two very beautiful landscapes at the rooms of the Art-Union
               in Broadway, which are considered equal to any that he has produced.
               They are called the Old World and the New. The New World is the
               best of the two, as it could not fail to be; it represents a river scene in
               Autumn; the sun has just gone down behind a range of purple hills in
               the distance, and the sky glows with peculiar brilliancy. The clouds
               which lie above the horizon like bars of gold, are, perhaps, a little
               heavy, but there is atmosphere enough for them to float in, notwithstanding, which is more than can be said of all his pictures. Indeed,
               the atmospheric efforts in the landscape are superior to any of his paintings that we have seen. The other picture, "the old world," has a
               ruined tower, and a vast reach of silent, treeless hills, over which the
               eye wanders until the sight is lost in the distance. The perspective
               of this picture is especially good; and it is pervaded with a good sentiment of decay, which harmonises well with the name. It is probably a view in the Island of Sicily, which appears to have taken a deep
               hold upon the mind of the painter, whose reminiscences of that classical
               soil have been very numerous the past three years.

         <p>The late 
            <span class="person" id="lblanchard">Laman Blanchard</span>.--This popular English essayist is so well known on our side the Atlantic, by his satirical sketches, which have formed one of the chief features
            of our light republishing magazines for the past ten years,
            that a sketch of him must be an acceptable bit of biography for magazine readers. We give the following condensed
            account of his life and labors from the last number of the
            New Monthly Magazine:--
         </p>
         
         <p>"
            <span class="person" id="lblanchard">Samuel Laman Blanchard</span>was born at Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk, on the 15th of May, 1803, the only boy of seven children. His
            father was in respectable circumstances, and removed to London
            when his sou was about live years old; here he received his education
            at St. Olave's school, Southwark, and became distinguished when a
            youth for an exquisite appreciation of the English poets.
         </p>
         
         <p>"Mr. 
            <span class="person" id="lblanchard">Blanchard</span> married in 1824, Miss  Anne Gates , a young lady of
            considerable personal attractions and good family. His first literary
            undertaking was a small volume of poems, published in the year 1828,
            called 'Lyric Offerings,' a collection that exhibited unquestionable
            evidence of high poetical talent. Indeed, as a poet, 
            <span class="person" id="lblanchard">Laman Blanchard</span>
            deserves to be placed in a front rank; for some of the lyrical pieces he
            has since produced possess the highest merit. This work made him
            favorably known. He began to write for one or two periodicals, and
            as at this time he had been appointed Secretary to the Zoological Society, he had sufficient employment for his leisure in cultivating his
            literary talents. The secretaryship was given up in 1831, and almost
            immediately afterwards he was engaged in editing both the Monthly
            Magazine and La Belle Assemblée. This employment brought him
            in connexion with literary men of different parties, among whom
            his sociality exercised an irresistible influence. He rose rapidly
            in the estimation of his more influential friends, and was selected to
            assist in establishing a new evening paper called The True Sun, in
            which he wrote for nearly two years with remarkable liveliness and
            spirit, and from which he withdrew a little before it ceased to exist.
            He was soon engaged upon other papers. The Constitutional and The
            Shipping Gazette, he tried in vain to establish, but there was no hope
            in a struggle with such competitors as already possessed the field.
            He was also editor of The Courier--this was when the Whigs were
            in office, and he fought their battles with great energy and talent.
         </p>
         
         <p>"We next find him editor of the Court Journal. Here he was rather out of his element. Fashionable Literature was of much too light
            a texture for him to manufacture successfully; nevertheless, he endeavoured to to meet the wants of such a journal, and for a long time
            continued to write graceful trifles in a style that charmed his elegant
            readers, and made them believe that a second 
            <span class="person" id="jaddison">Addison</span>had been created for their entertainment. After a year or two, he left the Court
            Journal for more congenial employment.--He became a constant contributor to the New Monthly Magazine, edited  George Cruikshank 's
            Omnibus, was engaged on the Examiner, and furnished occasional papers for several other publications both political and literary. He was
            always occupied, and in such a variety of ways as must have been destructive to the hopes his friends entertained of a true developement
            of his genius.--Now engaged upon a leader for a newspaper--now upon a paper for a magazine--a poem for an annual, or a review for one
            of the principal journals. The only volume which was completely
            his own was his first; but there were two works to which he contributed materials; these were 'The Literary Remains of L. E. L.' in two
            volumes, to which he contributed the 'Life;' and Dr. 
            <span class="person" id="wmaginn">Maginn</span>'s posthumous work, 'John Manesty, the Liverpool Merchant,' in three volumes, of which he wrote occasional chapters."
         </p>
         
         <p>The United States Hotel.--This very fine establishment
            has been leased by Mr.  Johnson , who is already well known
            to the travelling public. The lessee has reduced the prices,
            a very important feature in a first class hotel.
         </p>
         
         <p>A Prolific Authoress.--The late Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="bhofland">Hofland</span>, author of
            "The Son of a Genius," wrote seventy different works, besides contributions to magazines and periodicals, the gross sale of which, estimated from the returns of the publishers, has been about 300,000 copies,
            not including the translations into German and French, nor those sold
            in America where her works have been as popular as at home. Mrs.
            
            <span class="person" id="bhofland">Hofland</span> visited Paris in the summer of 1843, and soon after published
            her last work, "Emily's Record of a Trip to Paris." She died at
            Richmond on the 9th of November last, of inflammation in the brain,
            brought on by a fall about a fortnight before.
         </p>
         
         <p>A remarkable partiality for mud.--"The Hon.  James
            Harper " in declining an invitation of the Native Americans of Philadelphia to pay them a visit recently, informed them that he had not
            spent two days out of the city since his election to the Mayoralty.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Columbus (Mississippi) Democrat publishes some very
            beautiful lines written by Mrs. 
            <span class="person" id="sbdanbridge">Sarah B. Danbridge</span>, a grand-daughter
            of Patrick Henry. Their subject is "Buonaparte's Retreat across the
            Rhine." The Democrat also announces that "she has left many fugitive pieces among her acquaintances, the most of which have been
            carefully collected by one of her relations, who is now preparing them
            (with a biographical notice) for publication."

         <p>Notices to Correspondents.--Many thanks to  R. S. N. , of Cin.--
            also to  H. H. W. --we shall attend to his request, for our own sake, as
            well as for the sake of auld lang syne. The communication of X we are
            obliged to decline, not for its lack of merit, for we enjoyed the reading of
            it exceedingly, but because it has already appeared in another paper.
         </p>
         
         <p>An eastern paper thinks we have broken our neutrality, because we incidentally mentioned a fact to illustrate a principle; but we have made no
            declaration of neutrality. On the contrary, we hold ourselves free to
            discuss any measure of public interest without regard to political predilections.
         </p>
         
         <p>R. C. has strangely misinterpreted our whole course, as well as made two
            or three very gross misstatements, which, we must believe, were unintentional--although we cannot conceive how a person, even of his lively imagination, should have built up such a solid looking superstructure of falsehoods upon such an exceedingly slender foundation. He
            spells us backwards and cross-wise, every way but straight forward,
            and imputes to us motives and designs which we never dreamed of or uttered R. C. like many other innocent people who have but one idea, is
            quite harmless as an enemy, but very dangerous as a friend; a blind
            man still never shoot anybody at a distance, though when you come near
            him he may knock you down with his fist. The next time that he intends to do us a service, we should be glad to have timely notice of his designs, that we may guard against his favors. We shall reply in another place, to the paper in which he has made his misrepresentation.

            <div class="head"> BERTINI 'S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.</div>
            
            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
               work yet published in this country. Where pupils lure used this method
               the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
               given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
               carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which
               otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
               has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account
               and it is only by the study of such methods as 
               <span class="person" id="hjbertini">Bertini</span>'s that pupils will be en
               abted to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.
            </p>
            
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the rudments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
               is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from professional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of

            <p>It affords me much pleasure to add my testimony to the value, importance,
               and advantage of Mr. 
               <span class="person" id="gvandenhoff">George Vandenhoff</span>'s Work on Elocution. He has
               aptly styled it "a plain System such it truly is to those who will pursue
               the instruction given, step by step; and cannot fail of producing a beneficial
               and much wished for result in one of the departments of education so sadly
               neglected--correct reading--devoid of vulgarities, and errors in articulation
               and pronunciation. I hope the book will have a wide circulation, in order
               that the good which it is capable of effecting may be thus more extensively
               diffused, and a better system of instruction be afforded to the rising generation, in that which constitutes a most agreeable accomplishment In every
               gentleman's education, namely, "Logical and Musical Declamation."

            <p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
               say much to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of
               any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
               it marked by a dignity, candor, and forbearance not often found in works of
               a party character.
            </p>
            
            <p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig,  Tory ,
               and Radical. " Blackwood " and the "London Quarterly" are Tory; the
               "Edinburgh Review" Whig; and the "Westminster" Radical. The "Foreign Quarterly" is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
               foreign Continental Works.
