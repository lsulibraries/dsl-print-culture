            <div class="ab"> With suggestions for its improvement. A discourse (with
            <br/>additions) delivered on the 30th December, 1844, at the Repository
            <br/>of the American Institute. By John H. Griscom, M. D., Fellow

            <div class="ab">(Second Notice.) </div>
            <p>Although Dr. Griscom’s labors are mainly in behalf of
            <br/>the poor, yet he very clearly proves to the rich that their
            <br/>own welfare is closely connected with that of the lower
            <br/>orders.</p>
            <p>"At all seasons of the year, there is an amount of sickness and death,
            <br/>in this, as in all large cities, far beyond those of less densely peopled,
            <br/>more airy and open places, such as country residences. Even in vil-
            <br/>lages of small size, there is an observable difference over the isolated
            <br/>country dwelling, in the proportionate amount of disease prevailing ;
            <br/>proving conclusively that the congregation of animal and vegetable
            <br/>matters, with their constant effluvia, which has less chance of escape
            <br/>from the premises, in proportion to the absence of free circulation of
            <br/>air, is detrimental to the health of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>" These circumstances have never yet been investigated in this city,
            <br/>ns they should be. Our people, especially the more destitute, have
            <br/>been allowed to live out their brief lives in tainted and unwholesome
            <br/>atmospheres, and be subject to the silent and invisible encroachments
            <br/>of destructive agencies from every direction, without one warning voice
            <br/>being raised to point to them their danger, and without an effort to
            <br/>rescue them from their impending fate. Fathers are taken from their
            <br/>children, husbands from their wives, "ere they have lived out half
            <br/>their days,"—the widows and orphans are thrown upon public or pri-
            <br/>vate charity for support, and the money which is expended to save
            <br/>them from starvation, to educate them in the public schools, or, per-
            <br/>chance, to maintain them in the work house or the prison, if judi-
            <br/>ciously spent in improving the sanitary arrangements of the city, and
            <br/>instilling into the population a knowledge of the means by which their
            <br/>health might be protected, and their lives prolonged and made happy,
            <br/>would have been not only saved, but returned to the treasury in the
            <br/>increased health of the population, a much better state of public mor-
            <br/>als, and, by consequence, a more easily governed and respectable com-
            <br/>munity."</p>
            <p>The amount of suffering in our city, as detailed in this
            <br/>pamphlet, from causes within the power of our municipal
            <br/>government to remove, is much greater than we had suppos-
            <br/>ed could exist. One great cause of disease, as shown by
            <br/>Dr. Griscom, is the practice of sub-tenantage, which pre-
            <br/>vails to a very great extent among the very poor, and which
            <br/>is, perhaps, wholly beyond the power of the Corporation to
            <br/>remedy; but the greatest evils grow out of filthy streets,
            <br/>and these the Corporation have entirely under their own
            <br/>control; but the people have suffered so long from this
            <br/>grievance, that they now seem hardly conscious of its exis-
            <br/>tence, and sit down contentedly in their Glenburneyism,
            <br/>without making an effort for its removal. Yet we believe
            <br/>that any party which will give us clean streets for six
            <br/>months, will be kept in power forever by the people, out of
            <br/>gratitude for their good works. As Dr. Griscom truly ob-
            <br/>served, New York is more favorably situated than any other
            <br/>city in the world for the preservation of health; yet with
            <br/>all the advantages that nature has so bountifully bestowed
            <br/>upon us for the increase of happiness, we continue by the
            <br/>most violent departures from obvious rules of health to cul-
            <br/>tivate as great an amount of disease and suffering as any
            <br/>other city on the Continent.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <p>Dr. Griscom devotes a good part of his pamphlet to the
            <br/>subject of ventilation, on which our people need enlighten-
            <br/>ing to a fearful extent. The wealthy classes are generally
            <br/>as deficient of knowledge on this important subject as the
            <br/>laboring poor, and not unfrequently suffer acutely for lack of
            <br/>fresh air, of which they ignorantly deprive themselves. In
            <br/>remarking on the necessity of making physiology as applied
            <br/>to the laws of life, and the preventive of diseases, a study in
            <br/>all our private, public and common schools, the author says;</p>
            <p>"It is needless to say to an ignorant adult apparently free from
            <br/>sickness, that he lives, works and sleeps, in too confined an atmos-
            <br/>phere—he will answer that he is well enough, and a change would be
            <br/>irksome, and cost money, and he will not believe what you say, for
            <br/>he cannot be easily made to understand the importance, or even the
            <br/>right use, of air. But bring up his child in a knowledge of the value
            <br/>and necessity of pure fresh air, by teaching him the relations which it
            <br/>bears to the blood, the digestion and other functions—teach him nev-
            <br/>er to fear it, that it is his immediate and incessant source of life and
            <br/>health, give him a knowledge of the diseases and dangers to which its
            <br/>absence will subject him, and think you he would not avoid its impu-
            <br/>rities, as he would poison or the pestilence? In his school-room, his
            <br/>sitting-room, his chamber or his work-shop, he would seek for a pure
            <br/>clear atmosphere, as when thirsty he would seek the cool water, as
            <br/>the weary "hart panteth after the water brook." "Ventilate, Venti-
            <br/>late," would be his natural demand, in tones of earnestness propor-
            <br/>tioned to the necessity which his expansive lungs, and ever freshened
            <br/>feelings, would readily discover. The humble tenement of the laborer,
            <br/>would then, though but a single room, be no longer shut night and
            <br/>day, unvisited by the refreshing air of heaven; the work-shop would
            <br/>then be no longer a receptacle of foul effluvia of human and outer ori-
            <br/>gin, and our churches, public rooms, and lecture halls, be no longer
            <br/>unventilated. (En passant, what a strange inconsistency is it, in the
            <br/>refined and polished, to object to sip a mouthful of water from the
            <br/>same glass as another, in which there can be no possible contamina-
            <br/>tion, and yet swallow over and over again, the breath of others shut
            <br/>up in the same apartment, and which has passed through hundreds
            <br/>of lungs, perhaps diseased, and over teeth in every stage of decay.")</p>
            <p>The appropriation of the Common Council the present year
            <br/>for the Alms House, amounts to $197,000. Probably one
            <br/>quarter of that sum expended in keeping the residences of
            <br/>the poor in a healthy condition, would save another quarter
            <br/>at least, as may be seen from the extracts which follow.</p>
            <p>" As upon the condition of health of an individual are based his
            <br/>physical and mental strength, his ability for self-maintenance, his
            <br/>personal happiness, and that of others dependent on him, and also his
            <br/>usefulness to his family, to the community and his country; and as
            <br/>the community depends for its prosperity upon the performances of
            <br/>its members, individually and collectively, in the measure of influence
            <br/>committed to them respectively, so does the health of the people af-
            <br/>fect the capacity and interests of the state.</p>
            <p>" As upon the individual, when sick, falls an increased pecuniary
            <br/>burden, with (in general) a suspension of income, so upon the state
            <br/>or city, must rest, not only the expenses of removing an unsound
            <br/>condition of public health, but also, from the attendant loss of charac-
            <br/>ter, a diminution of its resources.</p>
            <p>" When individuals of the pauper class are ill, their entire support,
            <br/>and perchance, that of the whole family, falls upon the community.
            <br/>From a low state of general health, whether in an individual or in
            <br/>numbers, proceed diminished energy of body and of mind, and a
            <br/>vitiated moral perception, the frequent precursor of habits and deeds,
            <br/>which give employment to the officers of police, and the ministers of
            <br/>justice."</p>

            <div class="head">Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella.</div>
            <p>The Harpers have lately issued the tenth edition of Mr.
            <br/>Prescott’s invaluable " History of the Reign of Ferdinand and
            <br/>Isabella, the Catholic." It is not our intention of course, at
            <br/>this late day, to say anything critically of a work whose
            <br/>preeminent merit is as definitely settled, and as generally
            <br/>admitted as that of any history in existence. It would be
            <br/>difficult indeed, to urge anything, with a show of reason,
            <br/>against the book, considered with reference to Mr. Prescott’s
            <br/>intention in undertaking it—and it seems a matter of nearly
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page130"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>equal difficulty to add, in the way of approbation, a syllable
            <br/>to what has already been said. We are guilty of a sheer true-
            <br/>ism in maintaining that "Ferdinand and Isabella" is a
            <br/>thorough, elaborate, well arranged, well-toned, and original
            <br/>record of an epoch replete with events of importance to man-
            <br/>kind and of especial importance to Americans. If there lies
            <br/>upon this record a shadow of blame it is on the score of a
            <br/>very pardonable partiality for the principal personages intro-
            <br/>duced.</p>
            <p>Our purpose in penning this notice, now, is simply to call
            <br/>attention to the issue of a new edition, and to say a word or
            <br/>two of the book as a book merely, and as a very desirable
            <br/>acquisition to any library which shall happen to be with-
            <br/>out it.</p>
            <p>It is the sole work giving a particular account of the epoch
            <br/>it discusses—the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella—although
            <br/>there are particular narratives, in an unbroken series, from
            <br/>Charles the First to Charles the Third. Yet it was in the
            <br/>reign of Ferdinand and Isabella that the several provinces
            <br/>into which Spain had been so long parcelled off, were re-
            <br/>duced into one dominion—that the kingdom of Naples was
            <br/>conquered—that the Spanish Arabian empire was overthrown
            <br/>—that the Jews were banished—that the Inquisition was es-
            <br/>tablished—and, finally, that America was re-discovered by
            <br/>Columbus. This reign, too, (which should have been the
            <br/>historical basis of all the others) was rendered notable not
            <br/>only through Columbus, but through the illustrious states-
            <br/>man Ximenes, the " Great Captain" Gonsalvo de Cordova,
            <br/>and several other remarkable individuals, to say nothing of
            <br/>Isabella herself, in the illustration of whose character alone
            <br/>a bulky volume might be profitably written.</p>
            <p>The only continental histories of the period are "L'His-
            <br/>toire des Rois Catholiques Ferdinand et Isabelle par L'Abbe
            <br/>Mignot"—and the "Geschichte der Regierung Ferdinand
            <br/>des Katholischen, von Rupert Becker." These works, how-
            <br/>ever, are very brief and compendious ; neither of them equal-
            <br/>ling in bulk one of our ordinary novel volumes. Their au-
            <br/>thors refer only to the most accessible materials, and make
            <br/>no claim to research.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that previous to the period at which Mr. Pres-
            <br/>cott commenced his task (which was, we believe, in 1826 or
            <br/>1827), there were comparatively no facilities for its accom-
            <br/>plishment. The researches of Spanish literati have lately
            <br/>thrown much light, at random, on various points of the
            <br/>theme. Llorente, for example, the noted Secretary of the
            <br/>Inquisition, has issued his pregnant history of that memora-
            <br/>ble institution ; Conde has given a literal version of the Span-
            <br/>ish Arab chronicles; Sempere, Marina, and Capmany have
            <br/>written diffusely on the political aspect of Spain ; Navarrette
            <br/>has made an extensive collection of original documents con-
            <br/>cerning Columbus; and Clemencin has completed the sixth
            <br/>volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Spanish
            <br/>History. To these sources Mr. Prescott is. of course, very
            <br/>very greatly indebted, and he is the first to avail himself of
            <br/>the vast advantages they afford. Mr. Irving’s "History of
            <br/>Columbus" and "Chronicle of Granada" were very partial
            <br/>and very unexpected, although unquestionably very beauti-
            <br/>ful anticipations of small portions of Mr. Prescott’s great de-
            <br/>sign.</p>
            <p>The edition now issued by the Messrs. Harpers, is care-
            <br/>fully prepared from the third English edition, which em-
            <br/>braces many important matters not embodied in the original
            <br/>work. While the second edition was passing through the
            <br/>press, Mr. Prescott ireceived copies of two valuable Span-
            <br/>ish works having reference to his theme, but which from the
            <br/>recency of their issue, had not previously come to his know-
            <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>ledge. He was also enabled to avail himself of the "Ma-
            <br/>hommedan Dynasties of Spain," a book of great merit just
            <br/>then published by Don Pascual de Gayangos, and which
            <br/>throws much light upon the Arabian portion of the Peninsu-
            <br/>lar Annals.</p>
            <p>The mechanical execution of the "Ferdinand and Isabella"
            <br/>is every thing that can be desired. It is issued in three roy-
            <br/>al octavo volumes of about 400 pages each, printed on fine
            <br/>thick paper, with bold type, and illustrated with portraits of
            <br/>Isabella, Ferdinand, Columbus, Ximenes, and Gonsalvo of
            <br/>Cordova. It furnishes also numerous autographs of these
            <br/>and other celebrated personages of the time discussed. The
            <br/>binding is very neat and durable.</p>

            <p>It will be a happy time for the world, but especially hap-
            <br/>py for the reading part of it, when people shall be content to
            <br/>accomplish, in the shortest time possible, whatever they may
            <br/>feel themselves called to do. Time flies, should be inscri-
            <br/>bed on the door-posts of every author’s dwelling. An em-
            <br/>blematic figure, like that in the Hall of our National Legis-
            <br/>lature, does not appear to be sufficiently striking, though it
            <br/>tells the hours as they fly. The author who writes to amuse,
            <br/>may write as long as he can amuse, even though he should
            <br/>write tales longer than the Grand Cyrus, or Sir Charles
            <br/>Grandison ; but the author who writes to instruct, cannot
            <br/>write too briefly, for we have much to learn, and but little
            <br/>time to learn in ; one third must be given to sleep, another
            <br/>third, at least, to labor, and the rest to study, to amusements,
            <br/>to writing, and talking, and sight-seeing. The time that the
            <br/>best of us can devote to reading, is but short, and therefore,
            <br/>we cannot afford to read books which lack method, or which
            <br/>contain more words than are necessary to convey the author’s
            <br/>meaning, provided he have any. That Miss Fuller is justly
            <br/>chargeable with wasting the time of her readers, her most de-
            <br/>vout admirer cannot deny. Her book consists of two hun-
            <br/>dred pages, but all that it contains of her own suggesting,
            <br/>might be fairly compressed into a third of the space. The
            <br/>title is a misnomer to begin with; the one under which
            <br/>the essay was once published, " The great Law-suit, Man
            <br/>vs. Men: Woman vs. Women," was much better, because,
            <br/>having no particular meaning, it created no improper expec-
            <br/>tations. Miss Fuller informs us that she changed it because
            <br/>it was not understood ; she will have to change the present
            <br/>one, for an opposite reason. We keep looking for woman of
            <br/>the nineteenth century, but we only find a roster of female
            <br/>names from Panthea to Amelia Norman. The propriety of the
            <br/>title is the more doubtful from the following passage in her
            <br/>preface.</p>
            <p>"By man, I mean both man and woman. I lay no especial stress on
            <br/>the welfare of either. I believe the welfare of the one cannot be ef-
            <br/>fected without that of the other. My highest wish is that this truth
            <br/>should be distinctly and rationally apprehended ; and the conditions
            <br/>of life and freedom recognised as the same for the daughters and the
            <br/>sons of time."</p>
            <p>The style is somewhat stilted, but the thought is just and
            <br/>philosophical, and proves Miss Fuller to be a thinking,
            <br/>right-judging person. Why could she not, then, since she
            <br/>thinks so correctly, call her book, Man, or Society in the
            <br/>Nineteenth century, and so plead in a straight forward man-
            <br/>ner in behalf of man, without any specialities about woman’s
            <br/>rights or woman’s wrongs, as though she had either rights
            <br/>or wrongs, which are not also the rights and wrongs of men.
            <br/>We certainly did not expect from a woman of Miss Fuller’s
            <br/>natural and acquired powers, the wretched cant which we
            <br/>hear so often from men, who, having no claim upon man,
            <br/>seek for the sympathies of women, and from women, who,
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page131"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>having as little claim upon the sympathies of men, try for it
            <br/>by speaking in the name of their sex, about woman’s mission,
            <br/>woman’s influence, and woman’s rights; and we have not
            <br/>been disappointed ; she seems to entertain a wholesome hor-
            <br/>ror of the whole tribe of shallow canters. But then, if we do
            <br/>not misapprehend her, which we are not sure of, she has
            <br/>errors of her own which are more dangerous, because not so
            <br/>shallow as the others. She forgets, or rather seems to forget,
            <br/>that God created man male and female, notwithstanding the
            <br/>declaration in her preface, which we suspect, contains, like
            <br/>the postscript of a woman’s letter, the fact which she intend-
            <br/>ed to put into the body Of her work. She is dissatisfied that
            <br/>women are not men, and takes offence at the term "women
            <br/>and children"; words which to us sound sweeter for being
            <br/>spoken together. She is offended that women should esteem
            <br/>it a compliment to be called masculine, while men consider
            <br/>it a reproach to be called feminine. "Early I perceived,"
            <br/>she says, "that men, in no extremity of distress, ever wished
            <br/>themselves women." Of course not. It is the law that wo-
            <br/>man shall reverence her husband, and that he shall be her
            <br/>head. We may love those whom we protect, but we can
            <br/>never wish ourselves in their place, although we naturally
            <br/>wish to be like those from whom we receive protection. The
            <br/>wish of Desdemona that Heaven had made her like Othello,
            <br/>is the sweetest touch of nature in Shakspeare. Some have
            <br/>doubted what she meant, but they have only to read her wish
            <br/>by the light of revelation, and her meaning is clear. Miss
            <br/>Fuller says:</p>
            <p>"I have urged on woman, independence of man, not that I do not
            <br/>think the sexes mutually needed by one another, but because in woman,
            <br/>this fact has led to an excessive devotion, which has cooled love, de-
            <br/>graded marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should be
            <br/>to itself or the other. * * * That her hand may be given with
            <br/>dignity, she must be able to stand alone."</p>
            <p>This, we conceive to be the radical error of Miss Fuller’s
            <br/>reasoning, and directly opposed to the law of nature, of expe-
            <br/>rience and revelation. She says,</p>
            <p>"A profound thinker has said, that no married woman can represent
            <br/>the female world, for she belongs to her husband. The idea of woman
            <br/>must be represented by a virgin."</p>
            <p>He was a very shallow thinker, or a joker. It would be as
            <br/>reasonable to say that none but a deaf man could give a true
            <br/>idea of music. Woman is nothing but as a wife. How, then,
            <br/>can she truly represent the female character who has never
            <br/>filled it? No woman can be a true woman, who has not
            <br/>been a wife and a mother. These are not accidental charac-
            <br/>ters like those of mistress and servant, which may be tho-
            <br/>roughly understood without being acted ; but they are the
            <br/>natural destiny of woman, and if she is kept from them, her
            <br/>nature is distorted and unnatural; and she sees things
            <br/>through a false medium. Her report, therefore, of a char-
            <br/>acter which she never filled, must be received with distrust.</p>
            <p>It is not easy to discover from Miss Fuller’s essay what her
            <br/>precise ideas of the true relation of man and woman are;
            <br/>although on some points she is sufficiently distinct. Mrs.
            <br/>Jamieson, with true womanly feeling, said that she would pre-
            <br/>fer being Mary of Scotland to Elizabeth of England; but
            <br/>Miss Fuller would prefer being the termagant Queen and
            <br/>swearing by "God’s teeth." Colonel Emily Plater and
            <br/>Madame George Sand souod pleasantly in her ears. "If you
            <br/>ask me what offices women may fill," says Miss Fuller, "I
            <br/>reply any; let them be sea captains if you will." Very good,
            <br/>let them. We have a queen of England, and England claims
            <br/>to be mistress of the seas; let us have a woman Admiral.
            <br/>But we take sides with Spinoza, and answer that woman
            <br/>cannot command. She lacks the chief qualities of a com-
            <br/>mander. She cannot invent. She is an apt imitator, but she
            <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>cannot originate; and therefore we have no fears that we
            <br/>shall ever see woman in our halls of legislature, or in com-
            <br/>mand of our ships or armies. "A party of travellers lately
            <br/>visited a lonely hut on a mountain. There they found an old
            <br/>woman that told them she and her husband had lived there
            <br/>forty years; why, they said, did you chose so barren a spot?
            <br/>She did not know, it was the man’s notion. And during forty
            <br/>years she had been content to act, without knowing why, up-
            <br/>on the man’s notion. I would not have it so"; says Miss
            <br/>Fuller. In the name of all that is monstrous, what would
            <br/>she have? Would she have the woman to leave her hus-
            <br/>band, or would she have the husband abandon what he be-
            <br/>lieved to be for his interest to do, to satisfy a whim of his
            <br/>wife? She is not bound to provide for him, but he is bound
            <br/>to provide for her, and therefore he must be allowed the pri-
            <br/>vilege of following his own business in his own way, unless
            <br/>she can advise him better; but he must be the judge of the
            <br/>advice. The old woman was a true woman and a good wife,
            <br/>who had no thought but to please her husband. Women
            <br/>who have any other thoughts have no business with a hus-
            <br/>band. If there is anything clear in revealed and natural
            <br/>law, it is that man is the head of the woman. All the beau-
            <br/>ty, all the harmony, all the happiness of life is centred in this
            <br/>truth. The most perfect woman that the world has ever
            <br/>known, one who was tried as no other woman was ever tried,
            <br/>who was endowed by nature as few women have ever been
            <br/>endowed, the sweetest, purest being that ever bore the name
            <br/>of woman, counted herself nothing but the wife of her hus-
            <br/>band, would know no law but his will, no happiness but his
            <br/>love; and when his love grew cold, and he became dead to
            <br/>her, though living, she still remained true to him. The
            <br/>world has abounded in Ephesian widows, but there has been
            <br/>only one Eloisa. Yet Eloisa is the true type of perfect wo-
            <br/>man. But Eloisa is not the type of Miss Fuller’s ideal wife:
            <br/>she is better pleased with such a wife as Madame Roland,
            <br/>whose equality with her husband, and congeniality of tastes
            <br/>and employments, made her his companion and friend. She
            <br/>was, in truth, no wife at all, at least, to him, and she fully
            <br/>exemplified the truth which Miss Fuller denies, that love is
            <br/>a necessity with woman.</p>
            <p>"This is one of the best instances (the marriage of Ma-
            <br/>dame Roland) of a marriage of friendship. It was only friend-
            <br/>ship, whose basis was esteem; probably neither party knew
            <br/>love, except by name;" says Miss Fuller. But Thiers says ;
            <br/>"Elle respectait et chérissait son époux comme un père: elle
            <br/>éprouvait pour l’un des Girondins proscrits une passion pro-
            <br/>fonde, qu’ elle avait toujours contenue."</p>

        <div class="head">THE ART OF THE USE OF COLOR IN IMITATION IN PAINTING.
          <br/>NO. III.</div>
        <div class="byline">BY <span class="person">WILLIAM PAGE</span>.</div>
        <p>We all know that our picture, when it is done, should an-
          <br/>swer to a catechism like this, "If you tickle us, shall we not
          <br/>laugh? if you prick us, shall we not bleed? and if you
          <br/>wrong us, shall we not revenge?</p>
        <p>Now let us suppose that we have a white canvas on which
          <br/>we are to paint a head. White is not only the best re-
          <br/>ceiver of color, but indeed the only equal receiver of all co-
          <br/>lors, as well as that on which we can get the greatest
          <br/>transparency and permanence, and is least likely to swallow
          <br/>up eventually the colors put upon it, as is the case in dark
          <br/>grounds.</p>
        <p>On this white ground then we draw very carefully the outline, in red ink, so that it
          cannot be washed off by the
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page132"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>paint when passed over it, and so that it will Dot need cor-
          <br/>rection or removal, because whenever this has to be done, it
          <br/>must make a patch, which no skill can wholly hide; and
          <br/>then let us begin with the simplest colors we can get of
          <br/>known permanence.</p>
        <p>Take on the pallette Venetian Red, Vermillion and Prus-
          <br/>sian Blue—and only these, the first being really not a perfect
          <br/>red, but rather an orange color, that is, one in which yellow
          <br/>is mingled with the red. So indeed are almost all known
          <br/>pigments more or less mixed, and we have not the colors
          <br/>wherewith to represent perfectly the red, yellow, and blue,
          <br/>of nature, any more than those to represent light and dark-
          <br/>ness.</p>
        <p>Let us then take in a brush, some Venetian red, together
          <br/>with drying-oil, the only vehicle fit for oil painting, and
          <br/>brush over the place of the flesh with this red, so that we
          <br/>half obscure the white ground, covering every part of it, un-
          <br/>til it is perhaps half as dark as this color would make it if
          <br/>laid on to a solid body, which must not however be done
          <br/>anywhere, because this would make it opaque at the last, and
          <br/>the light ground should appear somewhat through, even to
          <br/>the end. After heightening the reds in the lips, cheeks. &amp;c.,
          <br/>where the carnations are to be more purplish, when com-
          <br/>pleted, with Vermillion; proceed to make out the shadows
          <br/>with the Venetian red, stronger as they deepen, until the
          <br/>forms are faintly indicated, and a tolerable idea of the rotun-
          <br/>dity of the head is given.</p>
        <p>But if the complexion of the subject is very clear, with
          <br/>uncommonly brilliant color; before laying on the Venetian
          <br/>red, paint in those bright parts with Vermillion on the white
          <br/>ground, and paint around them with the other reds. Then,
          <br/>whilst it is still wet, take a soft brush with Prussian blue,
          <br/>rather thin, and well diffused through the brush, sweep
          <br/>gently over those parts that either retire from the light, or
          <br/>the eye, neutralising with this, the red color more or less, as
          <br/>it is more or less indefinite in the head before you, until you
          <br/>have made out a complete general resemblance to the origi-
          <br/>nal. Be careful not to destroy the unity by entirely oblite-
          <br/>rating the red or the white ground anywhere, except, per-
          <br/>haps, in the deepest points of dark, as in the pupils of the
          <br/>eyes, for they are to be passed over with the rest, the nos-
          <br/>trils, and the darkest parts of the mouth. The hair may be
          <br/>treated in like manner, unless it be very peculiar in color, as
          <br/>a good preparation for after painting.</p>
        <p>When this painting is perfectly dry, if it should be found
          <br/>weak in effect, the same process may be repeated, until the
          <br/>full force of Chinese Vermillion be given in the cheeks, &amp;c.,
          <br/>that is, as much power of color as this pigment can be
          <br/>made to exhibit, for it will be brightest before it is per-
          <br/>fectly solid, or before it entirely obliterates the white ground.</p>
        <p>This stage, which in its progress will resemble as much
          <br/>as may be the mode used by miniature painters, on paper
          <br/>or ivory, must continue until all the force of color the pig-
          <br/>ments are capable of is produced, and the effect of the whole
          <br/>is as harmonious as possible.</p>
        <p>By this time it will be brought to that tone which I have
          <br/>attempted to describe, and in which alone it can attain its
          <br/>full force. As the color is yet only on the surface, it may
          <br/>perhaps be leathery, not however a discouraging circum-
          <br/>stance, unless the complexion to be imitated is remarkably
          <br/>clear, in case of which the blue must continue to be used
          <br/>over in the first painting, until something of a pearly or cool
          <br/>effect is produced, by the red being almost neutralised. If
          <br/>there be any while near the flesh, it should be treated in
          <br/>this way ; Venetian red passed over the white ground, until
          <br/>reduced to as low a tone as need be, and then, whilst it
          <br/>is wet, blue used over it, until all the red disappears.</p>
        <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
        <p>For what Sir Isaac Newton calls while, and produced by
          <br/>rapidly turning the seven prismatic colors on a wheel so as
          <br/>to mix them all together—was not white, which is positive,
          <br/>but the negation of color. This may also be done by so
          <br/>mixing the three primitive colors together, that neither is
          <br/>seen to predominate, and this, in its proper relation, will
          <br/>appear white; though in reality it will come into that me-
          <br/>dium degree of light which I have before named, and am
          <br/>obliged so often to refer to. So that what is called Venetian
          <br/>red being, as before stated, orange, and having added to it
          <br/>blue until the red and yellow of the orange disappear, or are
          <br/>neutralized, becomes, in this stage of the picture, the repre-
          <br/>sentative of white.</p>
        <p>It will then be seen that such a white you may heighten
          <br/>at pleasure, or represent shining objects upon, as could not
          <br/>be done, if you had already exhausted your power by the
          <br/>use of positive white. The picture in this state will of
          <br/>course have the look of glazing; this will be the look
          <br/>of wetness also, which all glazing has. Though this will
          <br/>not be so entirely wet as if the colors used had been what
          <br/>are known as transparent, and all known pigments except
          <br/>metals, have some degree of this transparent quality ; that
          <br/>is, they will all, with one exception, show through them
          <br/>something of the color on which they are laid, if they be not
          <br/>too thickly impasted thereon, (I speak of colors in oil.) And
          <br/>these more opaque pigments, Venetian red and Vermillion,
          <br/>are recommended, because the more transparent want that
          <br/>look of body, necessary to give the full force and solidity of
          <br/>flesh.</p>
        <p>Should the picture be capable of receiving additional
          <br/>strength from glazing reds or yellows, this is the state in
          <br/>which to use them to their fullest extent; though if it is
          <br/>as low as it should be in tone, it will appear to the un-
          <br/>initiated lower than nature, and cause one who lacks ex-
          <br/>perience in this mode, to fear that he has his flesh below
          <br/>that of Titian’s; but if it be really carried to a complete uni-
          <br/>ty in this stage, as it should be, the after process will, if well
          <br/>applied, cause your eyes to sparkle with the result which
          <br/>nature only need surpass.</p>
        <p>Let us suppose, then, that all the parts are complete, in
          <br/>their proper relations, no blackness in the shadows, and yet
          <br/>all the lights so far removed from white, that as seen by twi-
          <br/>light, the whole picture seems to sink to a fiat tone, and
          <br/>when it is sufficiently dark to hide the colors, shows as a
          <br/>blank canvas, of a low middle-tint, yet in the light of day,
          <br/>has all the power of the pallette in color.</p>
        <p>When this former painting is completely dry, take Na-
          <br/>ples yellow, which is the most opaque of all the colors in
          <br/>common use, and carries more light than anything but
          <br/>white itself, and mix with it a small portion of Ultramarine,
          <br/>enough to make the Naples yellow, which is, when best, a
          <br/>delicate orange color, perfectly neutral, so that it shows as
          <br/>much blue as either red or yellow. This is to be, in the
          <br/>next stage, your representative of light, which it is well cal-
          <br/>culated to do from its opacity, because light itself is opaque,
          <br/>particularly when seen concentrated or focussed on any glos-
          <br/>sy substance, glass for instance, where through the highest
          <br/>light no color can be seen, however brilliant.</p>
        <p>Now the picture being perfectly dry, and this light tint
          <br/>mixed for the purpose, let it be carefully spread over the
          <br/>flesh, light, dark, middle-tint and all; carefully I say, of
          <br/>course with the original before yon, using more or less, as
          <br/>the skin more or less obscures the blood beneath, but every-
          <br/>where some, though the less of this light that is required to
          <br/>produce the desired effect the better, as it weakens the
          <br/>colors beneath, which need to be kept as pure as possible,
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page133"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>oftentimes mere skin-deep, but as the skin is everywhere
          <br/>over the flesh, the surface everywhere lighter than beneath
          <br/>that surface, even in the deepest shadows, this will so repre-
          <br/>sent it, that through all the shadows, the skin will appear to
          <br/>pass, showing everywhere the blood beneath, and ten thou-
          <br/>sand silvery tones will be produced, surpassing the most
          <br/>skilful mixing of colors that can be attained without passing
          <br/>light over dark.</p>
        <p>Though everywhere this light must be passed over, yet no
          <br/>where must it be so thickened as wholly to obscure the
          <br/>color beneath, or the flesh where it occurs will be opaque—
          <br/>and only in the extremest locus of the lights is this the case
          <br/>in nature, the light every where else falling into the flesh,
          <br/>and the vision following it, and so will light and vision fall
          <br/>into the picture.</p>
        <p>Now, though the picture before this last process was ap-
          <br/>parently very low in tone, this has made it seem to be filled
          <br/>with light, and indeed it is so, for you see through it all, as
          <br/>well as into it, and the light penetrates to the ground and is
          <br/>reflected back again, bringing color with it. This use of the
          <br/>white ground is the only compensation we have to make
          <br/>amends in painting, for the great depth to which the light
          <br/>passes into real flesh, owing to the greater transparency
          <br/>of its substance, and that of the blood; but in the picture
          <br/>we get the surface comparatively opaque, colorless, and
          <br/>light, to represent the skin, and the red beneath comparative-
          <br/>ly transparent, and dark, for the blood.</p>
        <p>The flesh will now appear as light as need be, but you
          <br/>will remember that if you had used all the light of the mix-
          <br/>ture, which would be far too much, it would still be a very
          <br/>great way removed from white.</p>
        <p>Let us now take the same color which we used over the
          <br/>flesh for light, and with it make out, as economically as
          <br/>possible, the white spoken of above, taking care not to
          <br/>make it very light any where, that is, allowing the darker
          <br/>preparation to show through, unless the stuff to be imitated
          <br/>be many thicknesses of linen, for linen too shows the dark-
          <br/>ness through it, and must in a picture, or Titian himself
          <br/>could not make it more than tolerable, and certainly not low
          <br/>in tone.</p>
        <p>When this is again dry, take pure white and breathe it
          <br/>here and there on the high lights very thinly, bringing it to a
          <br/>small focus on the eyes, and where it shines the brightest,
          <br/>but always with the same strict economy that I have incul-
          <br/>cated, never using more light than the least that will serve,
          <br/>and if you have done well what is here advised, your pic-
          <br/>ture will possess what few modern pictures can boast, and
          <br/>yet what are the universal qualities of flesh in nature; the
          <br/>full force ol color, together with unity, and a skin over its
          <br/>surface, with ten thousand minuter beauties, nameless from
          <br/>their multitude, which yet the dullest eye can see when com-
          <br/>pared with the productions of the usual modes adopted in
          <br/>the painting of pictures. For all true general laws act per-
          <br/>fectly in the smallest particulars; witness the laws of the
          <br/>Creator.</p>
        <p>Wrong modes of color have often been so ingeniously
          <br/>used, and with so much feeling and perception of beauty,
          <br/>as to make a feeble means founded on false principles ap-
          <br/>pear to those who wanted experience and thought in the
          <br/>Matter, the true way. But in this that I have attempted
          <br/>thus far to present, though even so slightly sketched, may
          <br/>be found the broad principles of imitation and rational
          <br/>thought, and the only way I am well assured that can make
          <br/>Art worthy to be the study of such men as could adorn any
          <br/>liberal pursuit, and might revive a hope, in these days, of
          <br/>producing anything worthy admiration, or fit to be handed
          <br/>down to coming time.</p>
        <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
        <p>I neglected above to mention particularly the reason, as I
          <br/>promised to do, why the rich browns are found in the old
          <br/>masters in place of the greys of the moderns—though any
          <br/>one who understands well what I have written, can scarcely
          <br/>have failed to see ere this the cause. It is, that the " Old
          <br/>Colorists’" painting, as I said before, on the low key, with the
          <br/>full power of the primitives, could not fail, when these were
          <br/>united in full tone, to produce browns of great depth and
          <br/>richness; but now, painters introducing more light into their
          <br/>color, and of course weakening it thereby, when they mix
          <br/>them together produce greys instead of browns.</p>

      <div>
        <div class="head">GAMBLING.</div>
        <p>Of the evils of gambling it is needless to say a word.
          <br/>All the world are agreed that it is one of the most disastrous
          <br/>of vices—surpassed, perhaps, in the deplorable character of
          <br/>its results, by drunkenness alone. The crusade waged against
          <br/>the latter, found its most effective weapon, not in disserta-
          <br/>tion on the iniquity, but in exposition of the physical ill.
          <br/>Men who listened to sermons on intemperance as to matters
          <br/>that might or might not be worth thinking about at some
          <br/>future indefinite day, were startled at once into good resolves
          <br/>by a simple inspection of the coats of a drunkard’s stomach.
          <br/>The books and lectures of Mr. J. H. Green, the reformed
          <br/>gambler, are, upon the same principle, the most effective
          <br/>remedies for the vice he is endeavoring to overthrow. It is
          <br/>all very well to say in our pulpits " do not gamble, for it is a
          <br/>heinous sin but it is far better to demonstrate to the pub-
          <br/>lic satisfaction, that the man who gambles, without being
          <br/>himself a sharper, is at the absolute mercy of those who are.
          <br/>Let it be once clearly shown that there is really no chance in
          <br/>the matter, and that all is an absolute certainty in favor of
          <br/>the swindler by profession, and we put an end to gambling
          <br/>in general, by removing the inducement to gamble.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Green proves all this in a manner which must
          <br/>satisfy the most incredulous. In his books, he gives a full
          <br/>exposition of the various rogueries practised by the gambling
          <br/>fraternity ; and the man who reads these books and gambles
          <br/>in any shape again, is little better than an idiot. But more
          <br/>than this;—Mr. Green will have no objection to convince
          <br/>any one who may feel interested—to convince him by ocular
          <br/>demonstration of the absolute mastery held by the gambler
          <br/>over his victim. He will show that he (Mr. Green) can tell
          <br/>any card by the ordinary marks on its back—that it is in his
          <br/>power in dealing, to give himself a hand to suit his own pur.
          <br/>poses—in short that, in all games at cards, what his oppo-
          <br/>nent shall win or lose is entirely at the option of himself
          <br/>(Mr. Green). He will show, also, the deceptive mechanism
          <br/>of the faro-boxes, and roulette-tables, and explain in the
          <br/>clearest and most irrefutable manner, that the usual system
          <br/>of lottery-drawing is only a more comprehensive method of
          <br/>picking the public pocket.</p>
        <p>Now we maintain that the press has the victory over this
          <br/>vice within its own hands. If Mr. Green fail, the press only
          <br/>is responsible. He has done his part with a courage—with
          <br/>an unflinching resolution, to be estimated by those alone who
          <br/>have opportunities of knowing the desperate animosity of the
          <br/>class whose profession is thus to be overthrown. If the
          <br/>press now come to his aid—if it give publicity to his efforts
          <br/>—gambling will be more thoroughly suppressed than ever
          <br/>has been intemperance through the exertions of its opponents.
          <br/>It may be said Mr. Green’s object is merely to make money.
          <br/>And what then ? we have nothing to do with his private
          <br/>object; nor will the public object be one iota the less attain-
          <br/>ed because, in attaining it, the public puts money in the
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page134"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>pocket of Mr. Green. He has been at much trouble, and
          <br/>encountered great danger, in effecting a purpose which can-
          <br/>not fail of being highly advantageous to mankind. He has
          <br/>labored and is worthy of his hire; this altogether indepen-
          <br/>dently of his immediate motives, which nevertheless we be-
          <br/>lieve to be commendable. He seems actuated by a sincere
          <br/>desire to render the public a service, and by a very profound,
          <br/>and certainly a very natural disgust to the fraternity he has
          <br/>abandoned.</p>
        <p>We call therefore upon our brethren of the press to aid Mr. Green in his efforts. </p>
        <p>His books are "Gambling Unmasked," "The Arts and
          <br/>Miseries of Gambling," and "The Gambler’s Mirror"—the
          <br/>latter a serial work of which only the first number is as yet
          <br/>issued. They are to be obtained of all booksellers.</p>
        <p>Independently of their value as affording not only very
          <br/>full, but the sole existing expositions of all the arts of the
          <br/>blackleg, these publications have the merit of presenting nu-
          <br/>merous vivid pictures of the wretchedness wrought by the
          <br/>vice in question. These pictures are clearly from nature—
          <br/>from life. They bear with them distinct internal evidence
          <br/>of their truth. The volumes have often, too, a less painful
          <br/>interest, and are sometimes exceedingly amusing. We quote
          <br/>from the "Arts and Miseries" a specimen of highly ingeni-
          <br/>ous trickery:</p>
        <p>"To show still further the industry of this class of persons in in-
          <br/>venting means to deceive and win money, I will relate a trick played
          <br/>upon a merchant in Shrevesport. A gambler, who was there, bad a
          <br/>very fine dog, which he shut up two days without feeding him. The
          <br/>gambler told his secret partner to go and get into conversation with
          <br/>the merchant, and he would soon come by with his dog, which the
          <br/>partner would call into the store, and tell the merchant to weigh him;
          <br/>and he (the owner) would pass on and make no stop. The partner
          <br/>was also to suggest to the merchant the great probability of winning
          <br/>some champagne on the weight of the dog, as he, after weighing him,
          <br/>would know his weight better than the owner. The plan pleased the
          <br/>merchant, as he knew the owner to be a man always ready to bet.
          <br/>He weighed the dog, and turned him loose. The dog went home to
          <br/>his owner, who gave him some two or three pounds of meat to eat,
          <br/>and then walked back by the store with his dog, and made a stop to
          <br/>converse a while with some of his acquaintances. The merchant pro-
          <br/>posed to make a trifling bet that he could tell the dog’s weight as near
          <br/>as the owner ; and finally a very large bet was made. The merchant
          <br/>guessed first, and the owner guessed about two pounds more, and
          <br/>won ; for the meat he had just given his dog made about that differ-
          <br/>ence. The merchant could not, for a long time, account for his being
          <br/>deceived, as but a few minutes had elapsed since he had first weigh-
          <br/>ed the dog. But he had, unwisely, suffered himself to be drawn into
          <br/>a bet with a man who had made betting his whole business, and who
          <br/>never calculated to be beaten.</p>
        <p>But there is a gambling principle which lies deeper than the
          <br/>plummet of Mr. Green’s experience has sounded, and which
          <br/>requires exposure by some stronger hand. There are other
          <br/>gamblers than those who shuffle cards and rattle dice. Nine
          <br/>tenths of our leading politicians are gamblers, who make a
          <br/>business of calculating the chances of success in nominating
          <br/>men for office, and then bet and speculate accordingly,—not
          <br/>always for the lore of money, the love of power, or of office,
          <br/>but from the love of excitement: never, however, from the
          <br/>love of good principles. A very great part of our politicians
          <br/>gamble in more ways than in politics. Wall street opera-
          <br/>tors are nearly all gamblers. The subject is too notorious
          <br/>to require more than a hint; but if any one would like to
          <br/>see the gambling principle in full play, he may find as per-
          <br/>fect a development of it among the outside brokers of Wall
          <br/>street, who cluster about the doors of the Exchange just af-
          <br/>ter the adjournment of the "Board," as can be witnessed at
          <br/>any of the Hells in London or Paris. Merchants are gene-
          <br/>rally strongly imbued with gambling propensities; there are
          <br/>but few mercantile adventures which are not undertaken in
          <br/>a gambling spirit. One of the chief causes which influenced
          <br/>the Legislature in abolishing lotteries, was the frequent de-
          <br/>velopment of frauds committed by fiduciary agents to cover
          <br/>their losses in lottery gambling. But such frauds were not
          <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>diminished in the slightest degree by the abolition of lotte-
          <br/>ries. Gambling was never carried to such an extent as in
          <br/>1836, when the whole nation, from the priest in the pulpit
          <br/>to the President in Washington, gambled in land. There
          <br/>are many innocent people in New York, who read with great
          <br/>horror accounts of gambling in Paris, New Orleans and Lon-
          <br/>don, and are quite familiar with Crockford’s and other hou-
          <br/>ses in St. James’s, who never dream that they daily walk
          <br/>in the shadow of Hells quite as brilliant and quite as black
          <br/>as any in those cities. Young gentlemen are enticed to such
          <br/>places at first by a gratuitous supper, when all the elegances
          <br/>of the table are spread in lavish profusion, and afterwards
          <br/>they are drawn into the alluring maelstrom by a hope of
          <br/>gain, a love of excitement, or some other similar motive.</p>
        <p>Excitement of some kind all men, excepting only a few
          <br/>human sloths, require, and they will seek it as they will
          <br/>food—without any thought of consequences. The chief aim
          <br/>of the reform must be, to give this love of excitement a pro-
          <br/>per direction. Mr. Green is himself, doubtless, as favorable
          <br/>an illustration of our principle as could be afforded. If his
          <br/>motive could be strictly analysed, we have not a doubt that
          <br/>it would be found that his former gambling and his present
          <br/>exposures of the acts of the gambler, result from one cause.
          <br/>It is for this reason that the greatest sinners always make
          <br/>the greatest saints—as St. Paul and others.</p>

        <div class="head">THE NEW YORK GALLERY OF FINE ARTS.</div>
        <p>Good and bad pictures should never be exhibited together,
          <br/>for a poor work of art which might attract attention by it-
          <br/>self, will appear disgusting when hung by the side of a
          <br/>work of real merit; for this reason, if for no other, the di-
          <br/>rectors of this excellent institution have acted very unwisely
          <br/>in placing in the exhibition several pictures which do not
          <br/>deserve to be exhibited even by themselves. In the begin-
          <br/>ning of an institution which is to continue forever, and to
          <br/>influence people who will hardly know the names of its
          <br/>founders, it is of the greatest importance that right prin-
          <br/>ciples of action should be adopted; otherwise errors innu-
          <br/>merable must be the consequence. We do not find in the
          <br/>Constitution of the " New York Gallery of the Fine Arts,"
          <br/>or in the remarks appended to the Catalogue of pictures,
          <br/>any hint of the principles by which the trustees will be
          <br/>guided in their selections cl works of art, to be added to
          <br/>the gallery. We regard this as a very great oversight, as
          <br/>it leaves a wide door open to admit anything and every-
          <br/>thing which the whims or incapacity of any future trustees
          <br/>may choose to purchase, or accept as a donation; and ac-
          <br/>cording to the Constitution no work can ever be alienated
          <br/>from the Institution after it has become its property either
          <br/>by gift or purchase.</p>
        <p>In founding this Gallery, an opportunity was offered to
          <br/>render it unique and an honor to the country, by forming it
          <br/>exclusively of the best works of American Artists alone.
          <br/>It was a matter of trifling consequence whether it num-
          <br/>bered ten or a hundred pictures, if they were all of a
          <br/>high order of merit. A rigid impartiality in excluding se-
          <br/>cond-rate performances would have gained for it in the
          <br/>outset a high character, which would have attracted more
          <br/>visitors than a thousand works of ordinary merit could ever
          <br/>do. Above all things, copies of every kind should have been
          <br/>excluded.</p>
        <p>And it should have been one of the chief aims of the In-
          <br/>stitution to have at least one picture from every American
          <br/>Artist of any pretensions. But we find eleven paintings in
          <br/>the collection by G. W. Flagg, and not one by Inman or
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page135"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>Page. Of Mr. Flagg’s eleven pictures, not more than one de-
          <br/>serves a place in the gallery; but they are all fastened there
          <br/>for eternity, and unless a fire should snap them up some of
          <br/>these wintry nights, they will hang upon the walls until
          <br/>they drop from their frames, Falstaff and Lady Jane Grey
          <br/>and all. There are several other pictures which belong to
          <br/>the Gallery, and must, therefore, remain in its collection
          <br/>forever, which should be hung in a dark corner where
          <br/>they could never be seen: for instance, a Magdalen after
          <br/>Corregio; an Allegory—Italian school; View from Roster
          <br/>Hill, Richardson; Landscape—Dutch school; Boy fallen
          <br/>asleep over his dinner—Philip; Interior—Dutch school; Pan
          <br/>and Midas—Goltzius ; Assumption of the Virgin—Annibale
          <br/>Caracci; and the Old Fiddler after Teniers.</p>
        <p>Cole and Ingham have each presented a valuable picture
          <br/>to the gallery, and other artists have promised to do so.
          <br/>Mr. Ingham’s gift is an original portrait of Lafayette, paint-
          <br/>ed by himself, and Cole’s is a view in Sicily, one of his finest
          <br/>landscapes.</p>
        <p>Among the works loaned for exhibition are two of Mr.
          <br/>Edmonds’ most pleasing compositions, the boy stealing milk
          <br/>and the " bashful cousin;" an admirable copy from Titian,
          <br/>by Durand, and the Day Dream, by Ingham, probably the
          <br/>best female head he has ever painted. In addition to the
          <br/>paintings, there is a fine collection of rare engravings, which
          <br/>should be attentively studied by the public as an antidote to
          <br/>the magazine plates with which we are flooded every month.</p>
        <p>Taken altogether, the Gallery presents a very fine collec-
          <br/>tion of paintings, which are well worth visiting; but if it
          <br/>contained only the pictures by Cole and Mount, it might
          <br/>well be regarded with pride by a New Yorker.</p>
        <p>The public, no less than a re-public, is apt to be guilty of
          <br/>the sin of ingratitude, and like a pampered child, never
          <br/>troubles itself about the source whence its enjoyments are
          <br/>derived. We trust that the multitude who will gain pleasure
          <br/>and instruction from visiting this collection of works of Art,
          <br/>will bear in mind that it is not a spontaneous production, and
          <br/>that they are indebted to somebody for its existence. We be-
          <br/>lieve that the gentleman who was mainly instrumental in the
          <br/>formation of the " New York Gallery of the Fine Arts," is
          <br/>Jonathan Sturges, the former mercantile partner of Mr. Reed,
          <br/>to whose liberality we are indebted for the collection. Other
          <br/>gentlemen, of course, have lent their aid, among whom, we
          <br/>believe, Janies Brown, Shepard Knapp, F. W. Edmonds, and
          <br/>Charles M. Leupp, took an active part. Most of the grocers
          <br/>too, in Front street, out of respect to the memory of Mr. Reed,
          <br/>who held an eminent position among them, have subscribed
          <br/>liberally.</p>
        <p>We were a little premature in announcing that the Com-
          <br/>mon Council had unanimously resolved to allow the use of the
          <br/>Rotunda, to the Gallery, at a merely nominal rent, in spite
          <br/>of the Mayor’s veto of their former resolution ; it was only
          <br/>the Board of Aldermen that passed the unanimous resolutions ;
          <br/>the Board of Assistants, whose assistance, in this case, has
          <br/>not been of any particular help, referred the matter to a spe-
          <br/>cial committee, who will, it is apprehended, report adverse
          <br/>to it.</p>

            I.
            <br/>At the window stands the mother,
            <br/>In bed her son doth lie,
            <br/>" Wilt thou rise and look out, William?
            <br/>The procession goeth by."
            <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>" I am so sick, my mother,
            <br/>I can see and hear no more;
            <br/>I think of my dead Margaret,
            <br/>That makes my heart so sore."
            <br/>" Rise, we will go to Kevlaar,
            <br/>Book and rosary we will bear.
            <br/>And the dear mother of our Lord
            <br/>Will heal thy sick heart’s care."
            <br/>The chaunters they are chaunting,
            <br/>Swell the church's banners fine,
            <br/>And the long procession goeth
            <br/>To Cologne upon the Rhine.
            <br/>The crowd the mother follows,
            <br/>Her sick son carries she,
            <br/>While both do sing in chorus,
            <br/>" Oh, Mary, praise to thee!"
            II.
            <br/>The Virgin unto Kevlaar
            <br/>In gayest clothes they bear;
            <br/>To-day she has much work to do,
            <br/>For many sick come there;
            <br/>And the sick people carry,
            <br/>As offering good and meet,
            <br/>Full many waxen members,
            <br/>And waxen heads and feet.
            <br/>Whoso a waxen hand offers,
            <br/>Heals on his own the wound;
            <br/>Whoso a waxen foot offers,
            <br/>His own is thenceforth sound.
            <br/>Some who went there on crutches,
            <br/>Could dance on ropes that day;
            <br/>Some who had scarce a finger
            <br/>On the violin could play.
            <br/>The mother took a wax light,
            <br/>And moulded thence a heart,—
            <br/>" Bear that unto our mother,
            <br/>So shall she heal thy smart."
            <br/>Sighing he takes the wax heart,
            <br/>Sighing to Mary goes,
            <br/>Tears from his eyes are flowing,
            <br/>Prayer from his full heart flows.
            <br/>" Oh, thou most holy mother,
            <br/>Thou Virgin good and pure,
            <br/>Thou Queen of all the Heavens,
            <br/>Thou can’st my sorrow cure !"
            <br/>" I dwell with my dear mother
            <br/>In the city of Cologne,
            <br/>That may hundred chapels
            <br/>And churches high doth own.
            <br/>" And near to us dwelt Margaret,
            <br/>Who is dead for evermore.
            <br/>Mary, I bring thee a wax-heart,
            <br/>Heal thou my heart so sore.
            <br/>" If my sick heart thou healest,
            <br/>Early and late from me
            <br/>Shall ever rise the song and prayer,
            <br/>Oh, Mary, praise to thee !"
            III.
            <br/>The sick son and his mother
            <br/>In the little chamber lie,
            <br/>The Holy Virgin cometh
            <br/>And softly draweth nigh.
            <br/>She bends above the sick one,
            <br/>And then her hand doth lay
            <br/>On his poor heart so gently,
            <br/>And smiling fades away.
            <br/>All in dreams the mother seeth,
            <br/>And more had seen in sleep,
            <br/>But she wakened from her slumbers—
            <br/>The dog he howled so deep.
            <br/>There lay stretched out before her,
            <br/>Her son—and he was dead !
            <br/>On his pale cheek was playing
            <br/>The tender morning red.
            <br/>His hands the mother folded,
            <br/>She knew him dead to be,
            <br/>Then sang devout and softly,
            <br/>" Oh, Mary, praise to thee !"

        <div class="head">THE GREAT TOWER OF TARUDANT.</div>
        <div class="byline">BY <span class="person">ROBERT OLIVER</span>.</div>
        <div class="ab">(Continued from page 119.)</div>
        <p>Swiftly his noble steed bore him on, all that day and during
          <br/>the succeeding night. Much they suffered from hunger and
          <br/>thirst, but they were stouthearted and patient, and they quail-
          <br/>ed not nor flagged until mom came, the fresh and fragrant
          <br/>mom, when the king found himself at no great distance from
          <br/>a well, around which were growing palm trees and green
          <br/>and tender herbage. Joyfully he led his good horse to the
          <br/>water, and taking off his trappings turned him loose to feed
          <br/>and bask amid the delicious grass. He then slaked his own
          <br/>thirst, plucked and ate some of the dates that hung above
          <br/>his head, and sat down to rest and contemplated the scene
          <br/>before him.</p>
        <p>The well was full of beautiful clear water, but of such
          <br/>depth that the king could by no means perceive the bottom,
          <br/>but only far down a darkness deepening to intense obscurity.
          <br/>It was covered by a light and elegant dome of simple archi-
          <br/>tecture, whose cieling was adorned with silver stars, and in
          <br/>the midst an image of the moon, which were constantly re-
          <br/>flected in the still, transparent fluid beneath. The dome was
          <br/>supported by sixteen octagonal pillars of white marble where-
          <br/>on were engraved in letters of gold the holy words of the
          <br/>Koran. The tall and thickly tufted palms so completely
          <br/>sheltered the building, that even at noonday, when the sur-
          <br/>rounding desert glowed like a furnace, it was cool and plea-
          <br/>sant beneath that graceful roof.</p>
        <p>In this sweet place the king remained three days; each
          <br/>day drinking of the refreshing water and eating of the nou-
          <br/>rishing dates. In the cool of the morning he rode about on
          <br/>the sand to exercise his horse, and the rest of the day em-
          <br/>ployed in reading the words engraven on the pillars and in
          <br/>meditating on their meaning. At night he prayed and slept
          <br/>beneath the dome.</p>
        <p>On the morning of the fourth day feeling much invigorated
          <br/>and full of hope, he resolved to depart, though loth to quit
          <br/>so delightful a dwelling-place. His heart was cheered and
          <br/>his mind strengthened by the words he had read on the pil-
          <br/>lars, and the future gave him no anxiety. Having saddled
          <br/>his horse he approached the well and knelt down to return
          <br/>thanks to Allah and drink a parting draught. During each
          <br/>hour of his sojourn the water of the well had been growing
          <br/>clearer and clearer, and he now saw to an immense depth,
          <br/>though no glimpse of the bottom could yet be obtained. As
          <br/>he gazed downwards farther than ever before, he was startled
          <br/>to perceive the water troubled, and presently with amaze-
          <br/>ment, but also with delight, he beheld emerge from the well
          <br/>a female figure, habited in a beautiful blue garment, spangled
          <br/>with silver stars. About her neck was a string of pearls,
          <br/>and on her head a silver crescent like the rising moon. In
          <br/>her right hand was a wand, also of silver. Her form was
          <br/>commanding, though elegant, and her countenance lovely in
          <br/>feature, but cold and pale, no trace of color being visible.</p>
        <p>She looked upon Abdallah for a moment, and then said:—
          <br/>" You have been long expected, king of Tarudant, and are
          <br/>now well prepared. I am ready to be your guide."</p>
        <p>" Who and what art thou ?" inquired the monarch, as soon as his astonishment would suffer
          him to speak. </p>
        <p>" I am a fairy who for ages have dwelt at the bottom of
          <br/>this well, which never before was visited by mortal to whom
          <br/>I could reveal myself. Notwithstanding my seclusion, I
          <br/>know your history and your present condition. Trust to my
          <br/>guidance and you will be restored to your kingdom, and the
          <br/>false magician cast down from his bad eminence."</p>
        <p>There was something in the appearance of the fairy that
          <br/>commanded the king’s confidence, though he could not divest
          <br/>himself of a feeling of awe at her presence, and though she
          <br/>addressed him with a grave coldness, that bordered on auste-
          <br/>rity. Joy flowed into his heart with her words, and he
          <br/>warmly expressed his willingness to submit to her control.
          <br/>She continued:</p>
        <p>" Upon a mountain in the east, in the mighty Atlas chain,
          <br/>dwells a twin sister of mine, without whose assistance I can
          <br/>do little, with it, almost everything. First of all, we must
          <br/>seek her abode, which is distant and difficult of access. The
          <br/>way is toilsome and beset with dangers—are you ready to
          <br/>pursue it?"</p>
        <p>" I will go with you to the ends of the earth, O beautiful
          <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>and benign fairy! Cheered by the light of your presence, I
          <br/>can endure all toils and defy all dangers." </p>
        <p>" Come, then. Light indeed will be the toils I spoke of,
          <br/>and harmless the dangers, if you steadfastly abide with me,
          <br/>and yield willing obedience to my counsels ; but turn aside
          <br/>or falter in your faith and you are lost forever."</p>
        <p>She then gave him a silver bottle filled with water from
          <br/>the well, and a sack in which to put dates for himself and
          <br/>grass for his horse. They left the dome together and com-
          <br/>menced their journey over the desert, the fairy gliding light-
          <br/>ly along beside him. Said the king, glancing at the sur-
          <br/>rounding barrenness—"Why do you not, O wise and power-
          <br/>ful fairy, make use of the water of your well to fertilize this
          <br/>desert, to clothe it with beautiful vegetation, and people it
          <br/>with happy inhabitants ?"</p>
        <p>"I care nothing for the things you speak of," coldly re-
          <br/>plied the fairy, " I leave them to the sister we are seeking,
          <br/>whose whole delight is in such like works. My pleasure is
          <br/>to sit still at the bottom of my well in the clear, cool water,
          <br/>and contemplate the moon and stars and graven words above."</p>
        <p>This answer seemed strange to the king, " for why," said
          <br/>he to himself, " if she delights not in deeds of benevolence,
          <br/>has she taken me under her protection and engaged to guide
          <br/>me on a long and perilous journey, having for its end the re-
          <br/>covery of my kingdom ?" But a certain awe restrained him
          <br/>from speaking his thought, though he more than suspected
          <br/>that silence could not conceal it from the fairy.</p>
        <p>On they went for many days and nights, and Abdallah
          <br/>soon found to his great astonishment that he need take no
          <br/>thought for what he should eat, or what he should drink,
          <br/>nor for the sustenance of the good steed whereon he rode.
          <br/>The bottle of water and the sack of dates and grass which
          <br/>the fairy had given him, proved to be endowed with the most
          <br/>marvellous qualities; use did not diminish their contents, nor
          <br/>did time and heat despoil them of their freshness. This
          <br/>miracle inspired him with confidence in his wondrous guide,
          <br/>so strong that he felt nothing could ever shake it. Hence-
          <br/>forth he proceeded with a heart still lighter, and a mind still
          <br/>more assured.</p>
        <p>On the morning of the fourth day, soon after sunrise, as
          <br/>they were passing through a valley bounded by low hills of
          <br/>sand, a loud roaring was heard upon their left, so sudden and
          <br/>so frightful that the king’s hair stood straight upon his head,
          <br/>and his horse sprung aside with a start that nearly unseated
          <br/>the rider. In an instant after, six monstrous leopards came
          <br/>leaping over the hillock and fell upon Abdallah, whose first
          <br/>impulse was to draw his sabre and defend himself; but im-
          <br/>mediately remembering his guide and protectress, whom the
          <br/>leopards did not seem to see, he turned to her with a look
          <br/>of confident appeal. She smiled, and waved her silver wand.
          <br/>The beasts, one of whom had already fastened his claws up-
          <br/>on the horse, were struck with furious madness; quitting
          <br/>their expected prey, they rushed down the valley, tearing
          <br/>each other as they went and filling the air with howls of
          <br/>rage and pain, till they were lost to view in the desert.</p>
        <p>"Had you trusted alone to your own arm," said the fairy,
          <br/>when the king’s look returned from following the leopards to
          <br/>fall with gratitude upon her face, " they would have torn
          <br/>you limb from limb; earth breeds no fiercer beasts than they,
          <br/>and your weapon would have been but as a straw against
          <br/>their strength."</p>
        <p>"Words cannot express my thankfulness, O blessed fairy,
          <br/>for this deliverance; but see, my poor horse is dreadfully
          <br/>wounded—what can I do to relieve him ?"</p>
        <p>"Wash the wound with water from the silver bottle."
          <br/>The king did so, and when the blood was cleared away, the
          <br/>fairy passed her hand over the place and instantly the horse
          <br/>was healed, as sound and strong as ever.</p>
        <p>They proceeded on their way, and Abdallah, rendered vig-
          <br/>ilant by this encounter, kept wary watch on all sides, but
          <br/>perceived nothing alarming until just at high noon his glance
          <br/>fell upon a strangely shaped shadow flitting over the sand.
          <br/>Surprised at this, for the sky of the desert had been hitherto
          <br/>cloudless, he looked up to ascertain the cause, and beheld
          <br/>one of the monstrous green birds that he had last seen flying
          <br/>to and fro in the smoke of the tower, coming down directly
          <br/>over his head, with a large tortoise clutched in its talons.
          <br/>When the monster saw that it was seen, it screamed with
          <br/>baffled rage and let fall the tortoise, which would have
          <br/>crushed the king to earth had he not spurred his horse aside
          <br/>just in time to avoid the missile. It struck where he had
          <br/>stood with such force as to sink deep into the sand.</p>
        <div class="pagebreak" id="#page138"/>
        <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
        <p>The king looked around for the fairy, but she was nowhere
          <br/>to be seen. He had no lime to be amazed at her disappear-
          <br/>ance, for the bird had descended almost as quickly as the
          <br/>tortoise, and was rushing at him with its seven heads
          <br/>stretched greedily forwards, and its mighty wings beating
          <br/>the air with such force that the sand flew up as if raised by
          <br/>a whirlwind. Retreat was impossible. Nerving himself
          <br/>with a brief prayer to Allah, the king drew his sabre and
          <br/>awaited the onset. He scarcely hoped that his horse would
          <br/>endure the sight of so terrible a creature ; but the good steed
          <br/>bravely faced the monster, which in an instant was upon them
          <br/>and seized the king’s left arm with one of its beaks, while
          <br/>with the others it strove to pluck out his eyes and those of
          <br/>the horse. At a blow Abdallah struck off the head that grip-
          <br/>ed his arm. The blood spouted forth like a fountain, and
          <br/>the screams of the bird rang far and wide through the desert,
          <br/>startling the wild beasts in their lairs, and arousing a thou-
          <br/>sand answering roars. Mad with pain and fury, the monster
          <br/>grasped with all its remaining beaks the arm that had inflict-
          <br/>ed the wound, and would have torn it off, but just then a
          <br/>dove appeared, flying downwards, and alighted upon the
          <br/>head of the king’s horse—a small white dove with coral-
          <br/>colored feet and eyes of ruby hue.</p>

        <div class="head">INDIAN NAMES OF THE ISLANDS AND BAY OF NEW YORK.</div>
        <div class="byline">BY <span class="person">H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT</span>.</div>
        <p>The first name, which occurs, is that of the Hudson river.
          <br/>It does not appear that the discoverer thought of giving it
          <br/>his own name. In the narrative of his voyage, it is called
          <br/>the Great River of the Mountains, or simply the Great river.
          <br/>This term was simply translated by his employers, the ser-
          <br/>vants of the Dutch West India Company, who, on the
          <br/>early maps of Nova Belgica, called it Groote Riviere. It
          <br/>was afterwards called Nassau, after the reigning House, but
          <br/>this name was not persevered in. After a subsequent time,
          <br/>they gave it the name of Mauritius, after Prince Maurice, but
          <br/>this name, if it was ever much in vogue, either did not pre-
          <br/>vail against, or was early exchanged for the popular term of
          <br/>North River—a name which it emphatically bore to distin-
          <br/>guish it from the Lenapihittuck or Delaware, which they
          <br/>called South river. [Zuydt Rivier.] That the name of
          <br/>Mauritius was but partially introduced, is indicated by the
          <br/>reply made by the New England authorities to a letter res-
          <br/>pecting boundaries of Gov. Kieft, in 1646, in which they
          <br/>declare, in answer to his complaint of encroachments on its
          <br/>settlements, their entire ignorance of any river bearing this
          <br/>name.</p>
        <p>Neither of the Indian names by which it was called, ap-
          <br/>pear to have found much favor. The Mohegans called it
          <br/>Shatemuc. Shaita, in the cognate dialect of the Odjibwa,
          <br/>means a pelican. It cannot be affirmed, to denote the same
          <br/>object in this dialect, nor is it known that the pelican has ev-
          <br/>er been seen on this river. Uc is the ordinary inflection for
          <br/>locality. The Mincees, occupying the west banks, called it
          <br/>Mohegan-ittuck. The syllable itt, before uck, is one of the
          <br/>most transitive forms, by which the action of the nominative
          <br/>is engrafted upon the objective, without communicating any
          <br/>new meaning. The signification of the term is, Mohegan
          <br/>river. The Iroquois, (as given bv the interpreter John
          <br/>Bleecker, and communicated by the late Dr. Samnel L.
          <br/>Mitchell in a letter to Dr. Miller in 1811,) called Ca ho ha
          <br/>ta tè a,—that is to say, if we have apprehended the word,
          <br/>the "real river having mountains beyond the Cahoh or Cahoes
          <br/>Falls.</p>
        <p>The three prominent Indian names for the Hudson
          <br/>are therefore the MOHEGAN, the CHATEMUC, and the CAHOTATEA.</p>
        <p>The river appears also to have been also called, by other
          <br/>tribes of the Iroquois confederacy, Sanataty. The word
          <br/>ataty, here, is the same written atatea, above, and is des-
          <br/>criptive of various scenes according to its prefix. The En-
          <br/>glish first named the river, the Hudson, after the surrender
          <br/>of the colony in 1664. It does not appear, under this name,
          <br/>in any Dutch work or record, which has been examined. It
          <br/>may be observed, that the term has not exclusively prevailed
          <br/>to the present day, among New Yorkers in the river counties,
          <br/>where the name of North River is still popular. It will be
          <br/>recollected, as a proof of the prevailing custom, that Fulton
          <br/>called bis first boat, to test the triumph of steam, "The
          <br/>North River."</p>
        <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
        <p>If the river failed to bear to future times, either of its
          <br/>original names, the island, as the nominative of the city,
          <br/>was equally unfortunate, the more so it is conceived, as the
          <br/>name of the city became the name of the state. Regret has
          <br/>been expressed, that some one of the sonorous anil appro-
          <br/>priate Indian names of the west, had not been chosen to des-
          <br/>ignate the state. The colonists were but little regardful of
          <br/>questions of this kind. Both the Dutch in 1609 and the En-
          <br/>glish in 1665, came with precisely the same force of national
          <br/>prepossession—the first in favor of Amsterdam, and the sec-
          <br/>ond in favor of New York—both connected with the belit-
          <br/>tling adjective "New." It is characteristic of the English,
          <br/>that they have sought to perpetuate the remembrance of
          <br/>their victories, conquests and discoveries, by these geograph-
          <br/>ical names. And the word New York, if it redound less to
          <br/>their military or naval glory, than Blenheim, Trafalgar and
          <br/>Waterloo may be cited to show, that there was an early de-
          <br/>veloped trait of character of the English, abroad as
          <br/>well as at home. It would be well, indeed, if their de-
          <br/>scendants in America had been a little more alive to the in-
          <br/>fluence of this trait. Those who love the land, and cherish
          <br/>its nationalities, would at least have been spared, in witness-
          <br/>ing the growth and development of this great city, the con-
          <br/>tinued repetition of foreign, petty or vulgar names, for our
          <br/>streets and squares and public resorts, while such names as
          <br/>Saratoga and Ticonderoga, Niagara and Ontario, Iosco and
          <br/>Owasco, are never thought of.</p>
        <p>The Indians called the Island MON-A-TON—dropping the
          <br/>locol inflection uk. The word is variously written by early
          <br/>writers. The sound as pronounced to me in 1827 by Metox-
          <br/>on, a Mohegan chief, is Mon ah tan uk, a phrase which is
          <br/>descriptive of the whirlpool of Hellgate. Mon or man, as
          <br/>here written, is the radix of the adjective bad, carrying as it
          <br/>does, in its multiplied forms, the various meanings of violent,
          <br/>dangerous, &amp;c., when applied in compounds. Ah tun, is a
          <br/>generic term for a channel, or stream of running water. Uk,
          <br/>denotes locality, and also plurality. When the tribe has thus
          <br/>denoted this passage, which is confessedly the most striking
          <br/>and characteristic geographical feature of the region, they
          <br/>called the island near it, to imply the Anglicised term,
          <br/>Man-hat-tan, and themselves Mon-a-tuns, that is to say,
          <br/>" People of the Whirlpool." It is well known that the In-
          <br/>dian tribes, have, generally, taken their distinctive names
          <br/>from geographical features. The Narragansetts, as we are
          <br/>told by Roger Williams, took that name, from a small island
          <br/>off the coast. Massachusetts, according to the same author-
          <br/>ity, signifies the Blue Hills, and is derived from the appear-
          <br/>ance of lands at sea. Mississaga, signifies they live at the
          <br/>mouth of a large river, and by an inflection, the people who
          <br/>live at the mouth of the large river or waters. Onondaga,
          <br/>means the people who live on the hill. Oneida, the peo-
          <br/>ple who sprang from a rock, &amp;c. These names afford no
          <br/>clue to nationality, they preserve no ethnological chain.</p>
        <p>The tradition that this island derives its name from the
          <br/>accidental circumstance of the intoxication of the Indians on
          <br/>Hudson’s first visit, in 1609, is a sheer inference, unsupport-
          <br/>ed by philology. That the tradition of such an event was
          <br/>preserved and related to the early missionaries by the Mohe-
          <br/>gan Indians, admits of no doubt, nor is there more, that the
          <br/>island was referred to as the place where their ancestors first
          <br/>obtained the taste of ardent spirits. That the island had no
          <br/>name prior to 1609, or if well known by a characteristic
          <br/>name, that this elder name was then dropped and a new
          <br/>name bestowed, in allusion to this circumstance of the intox-
          <br/>ication, is not only improbable, on known principles, but is
          <br/>wholly unsustained, as will have been perceived by the above
          <br/>etymology. The word for intoxication, or dizziness from
          <br/>drink, in the Algonquin, and with little change in all the
          <br/>cognate dialects, is Ke wush kwä bee. The verb to drink in
          <br/>the same dialects is Min e kwä, in the Mohegan "Minahn"
          <br/>—words having none of the necessary elements of this com-
          <br/>pound. Very great care is, indeed, required in recording In-
          <br/>dian words, to be certain that the word given, is actually ex-
          <br/>pressive of the object of inquiry. Some curious and amusing
          <br/>examples of mistakes of this kind might be given, did it com-
          <br/>port with the limits of this report.</p>
        <p>There were several Indian villages, or places of resort, on
          <br/>the island of Mon-à-tun, for which the original names have
          <br/>survived. The extreme point of land, between the junction
          <br/>of the East and North rivers, of which the Battery is now a
          <br/>part, was called Kapsee—and within the memory of persons
          <br/>still living was known as "the Copsie point"—a term which
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page139"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>appears to denote a safe place of landing, formed by eddy
          <br/>waters. There was a village called Sapokanican, on the
          <br/>shores of the Hudson, at the present site of Greenwich.
          <br/>Corlear’s Hook was called Naghtogok. The particle took,
          <br/>here, denotes sand. A tract of meadow land on the north
          <br/>end of the island, near Kingsbridge, was called Muscoota,
          <br/>that is, meadow or grass land. Warpoes was a term be-
          <br/>stowed on a piece of elevated ground, situated above and
          <br/>beyond the small lake or pond called the Kolck. This
          <br/>term is, apparently, a derivative from Wawbose, a hare.</p>
        <p>The islands around the city had their appropriate names.
          <br/>Long Island was called Metòac, after the name of the Me-
          <br/>tòacks, the principal tribe located on it. It is thus called by
          <br/>Van Der Donck in 1656, and in all the subsequent maps of
          <br/>authority, dowa to Evans’, in 1775. Smith calls it Meit-
          <br/>owacks. In Gov. Clinton’s discourse, it is printed Meilo-
          <br/>wacks, but this is evidently a typographical error.</p>
        <p>Staten Island, we are informed by De Vries, was occupied
          <br/>by the Mon-a-tans, who called it MONOCKNONG with a verbal
          <br/>prefix. The termination is ong, denotes locality. Manon is
          <br/>the ironwood tree, ack denotes a tree, or trunk, and admits
          <br/>a prefix from " manadud," bad. By inquiry it does not ap-
          <br/>pear that the Ironwood, although present, ever existed in
          <br/>sufficient abundance to render the name from that character-
          <br/>istic. The other, it is too late to investigate. It is believed
          <br/>the expression had an implied meaning, and denoted the
          <br/>Haunted Woods.</p>
        <p>Thus far the colonial maps and records, so far as they have
          <br/>fallen under the committee’s notice. The vocabulary of the
          <br/>Mohegans affords, however, a few other terms, the applica-
          <br/>tion of which may be well assumed from their etymology.
          <br/>Of this kind is the term NAOSH, for Sandy Hook, meaning a
          <br/>point surpassing others. MINNISAIS, or the lesser island, for
          <br/>Bedlow’s island ; and KIOSHK, or Gull island, for Ellis’s island.
          <br/>The heights of Brooklyn are graphically described in the
          <br/>term Ihpetonga; that is, high sandy banks.</p>
        <p>The geological structure of the island was such as to bring
          <br/>it to a much narrower point, than it now occupies. By the
          <br/>recent excavations for the foundations of Trinity Church, and
          <br/>the commercial buildings on the site of the Old Presbyterian
          <br/>Church in Wall-street, the principal stratum is seen to be of
          <br/>coarse grey sea sand, capped with a similar soil, mixed with
          <br/>vegetable mould and feruginous oxide. From the make of
          <br/>the land, the Indian path, on the Trinity plateau, forked at
          <br/>the foot of the Park, and proceeded east of the small lake
          <br/>called the Kolck [Agieҫon] to the rise of ground at Chatham
          <br/>square. Here, or not far from it, was the eminence called
          <br/>WARPOES, probably the site of a village, and so named from
          <br/>its chief. The stream and marsh existing where Canal street
          <br/>now runs, gave this eastern tendency to the main path. At
          <br/>or beyond Warpoes, another fork in the path became neces-
          <br/>sary to reach the banks of the Hudson at the Indian village
          <br/>of LAPINIKAN, now Greenwich. In this route laid the emi-
          <br/>nence ISHPATENA, late Richmond Hill, at the corner of Charl-
          <br/>ton and Varick streets. The path leading from the inter-
          <br/>junction at Warpoes, or Chatham square, to NAHTONK, or
          <br/>Corlear’s Hook, had no intermediate village, of which the
          <br/>name has survived. This portion of the island was covered
          <br/>with a fine forest of nut wood, oaks, and other hard-wood
          <br/>species, interspersed with grassy glades, about the sites of the
          <br/>Indian villages. The upper part of the island was densely
          <br/>wooded. Above Fortieth street it was unfavorable for any
          <br/>purpose but hunting, and much of the middle part of it, as
          <br/>between Fifth and Eighth Avenues, was either shoe-deep
          <br/>under water or naturally swampy. This arose, as is seen at
          <br/>this day, from a clayey stratum, which retains the moisture,
          <br/>whereas the whole island below this location, particularly
          <br/>below the brow of the sycnitic formation of Thirty-seventh
          <br/>street, &amp;c., consisted of gravel and sand, which absorbed the
          <br/>moisture and rendered it the most favorable site for building
          <br/>and occupation. On the margin of the Hudson, the water
          <br/>reached, tradition tells us, to Greenwich street. There is a
          <br/>yellow painted wooden house still standing at the northeast
          <br/>corner of Courtland and Greenwich streets, which had the
          <br/>waternear toil. Similar tradition assures us that Broadstreet
          <br/>was the site of a marsh, and small creek. The same may
          <br/>be said of the foot of Maiden lane, once Fly Market, and of
          <br/>the outlet of the Muskeeg or Swamp, now Ferry street.
          <br/>Pearl street marked the winding margin of the East river.
          <br/>Foundations dug here reach the ancient banks of oyster
          <br/>shells. Ashibic denotes the probable narrow ridge or ancient
          <br/>cliff north of Beekman street, which bounded the marsh
          <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>below. OCITOC is a term for the heighth of land in
          <br/>Broadway, at Niblo’s ; ABIC, a rock rising up in the Battery ;
          <br/>PENABIC, Mt. Washington, or the Comb mountain. These
          <br/>notices, drawn from philology, and, in part, the earlier geo-
          <br/>graphical accounts of New Belgium, might be extended to a
          <br/>few other points, which are clearly denoted ; but are deemed
          <br/>sufficient to sustain the conclusions, which we have arrived
          <br/>at, that the main configuration of the leading thoroughfares
          <br/>of the city, from the ancient canoe-place at Copsie or the
          <br/>Battery, extending north to the Park, and thence to Chatham
          <br/>square and the Bowery, and west to Tivoli Garden, &amp;c.,
          <br/>were ancient roads, in the early times of Holland supremacy,
          <br/>which followed the psimary Indian foot-paths.</p>
        <p>Governor’s island bore the name of Nut island, during the
          <br/>Holland supremacy, in Dutch Nutten ; but whether, as is
          <br/>suspected, this was a translation of the Indian Pecanuc, or
          <br/>"nut-trees," is not certain. As a general remark, it may be
          <br/>said that the names of the Mon-à-tons, or Manhattanese,
          <br/>were not euphonous, certainly less so than those of the Dela-
          <br/>wares or Iroquois.</p>

        <div class="head">GRAHAM'S MAGAZINE,</div>
        <p>Whatever may be the merits or demerits, generally, of
          <br/>the Magazine literature of America, there can be no ques-
          <br/>tion as to its extent or its influence. The topic—Magazine
          <br/>literature—is therefore, an important one. In a few years its
          <br/>importance will be found to have increased in geometrical
          <br/>ratio. The whole tendency of the age is Magazine-ward.
          <br/>The quarterly reviews have never been popular. Not only
          <br/>are they too stilted (by way of keeping up a due dignity ), but
          <br/>they make a point, for the same reason, of discussing only
          <br/>topics which are caviare to the many, and which, for the
          <br/>most part, have only a conventional interest, even with the
          <br/>few. Their issues, also, are at too long intervals: their
          <br/>subjects get cold before being served up. In a word, their
          <br/>ponderosity is quite out of keeping with the movement--with
          <br/>the rush of the age. We now demand the light artillery of
          <br/>the intellect: we need the curt, the condensed, the pointed
          <br/>the readily diffused—in place of the verbose, the detailed,'
          <br/>the voluminous, the inaccessible. On the other hand, the
          <br/>lightness of the artillery must not degenerate into pop-gun-
          <br/>nery—by which character we may designate the character
          <br/>of the greater portion of the newspaper press; whose sole
          <br/>legitimate object is the discussion of ephemeral matters in an
          <br/>ephemeral manner. Whatever talent may be brought to bear
          <br/>upon our daily journals, (and in many cases this talent is very
          <br/>great) still the imperative necessity of catching, currente
          <br/>calamo, every topic as it flits before the eye of the public
          <br/>must, of course, materially narrow the limits of their power.
          <br/>The bulk, and the period of issue of the Monthly Magazine
          <br/>seem to be precisely adapted, if not to all the literary wants
          <br/>of the day, at least to the largest and most imperative as
          <br/>well as the most consequential portion of them.</p>
        <p>With these views, we shall, of course, regard attentively
          <br/>all that concerns our Magazines. It is our design to treat
          <br/>this class of journals with a consideration to which hitherto
          <br/>they have been unaccustomed. We propose neither to be
          <br/>laud nor to abuse them ; but in regarding them as the most
          <br/>important arenas for our literary men, we shall be pardoned
          <br/>for sweeping them clean of all that is adventitious.</p>
        <p>Keeping these intentions in mind, as points to be accom-
          <br/>plished in the future, we shall content ourselves, this Week
          <br/>with a few observations, at random, on the March number of
          <br/>Graham’s Magazine—reserving its general character, as well
          <br/>as the general character of its class, for more deliberate in-
          <br/>vestigation hereafter. </p>
        <p>The two first plates are capitally designed and engraved;
          <br/>the "Dacota Woman and Assiniboin Girl," in especial is
          <br/>worthy of all commendation. No annual has been issued in
          <div class="pagebreak" id="#page140"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>America which might not have been proud of these illustra-
          <br/>tions. The third plate, called the " Love-Letter," is dis-
          <br/>graceful in every respect. The flesh of the woman is sheep’s
          <br/>wool, and the hand holding the love-missive, has the air of
          <br/>having been carved by a very small child, with a dull knife,
          <br/>from a raw potato. The essay on Egotism is well written
          <br/>and pointed. Miss Sedgwick’s " Incidents at Rome" is only
          <br/>mediocre; it has little either of force or novelty. Mr.
          <br/>Simms’ " Boatman's Revenge" is a spirited tale, by one of our
          <br/>best narrators of similar things—a man whose literary inter-
          <br/>ests have suffered by too pertinacious a residence in the
          <br/>South. Mr. Simms is full of fault, but he has a true vigor
          <br/>which more than redeems it. The division of his present
          <br/>story into chapters is without meaning, and has a stiffness
          <br/>which is objectionable. " Serenading" is only so-so. " Lucy
          <br/>Dutton," by Fanny Forrester, is gracefully told. "Foreign
          <br/>Mysteries," by Grund, and " Carry Carlisle" by Mrs. Osgood,
          <br/>are the best contributed prose articles in the number; the
          <br/>latter piece embodying also some of the best poetry. The
          <br/>editorial criticisms of " Graham" are in general vigorous and
          <br/>pungent—but the notice of " Lowell’s Conversations" in the
          <br/>present number, by no means does justice, we think, to the
          <br/>very great and peculiar abilities of the author reviewed.</p>

        <a href=""/>
         <div class="note" id="">We find the following, remarkable story in the New York
          <br/>Evangelist of last week, without any indication of the source
          <br/>whence it was derived. But it has all the appearance of
          <br/>truth, and all the strangeness of fiction; it is a novel incident
          <br/>in American life, which somebody or other will doubtlesss
          <br/>make the foundation of a tale.</div>
        <p>In 1835, Mr. Ammi Filley, of Windsor, Ct., removed with his family
          <br/>to the town of Jackson, in the State of Michigan. In this town,
          <br/>then a wilderness, he located himself, and by his industry and econo-
          <br/>my he soon found himself in the possession of a productive and profit-
          <br/>able farm; and by the accession of settlers, the town became populous
          <br/>and flourishing. Although in the vicinity of various tribes of savages,
          <br/>and often visited by wandering families of the natives, all was peace
          <br/>and quietness, and every thing conspired to render their abode
          <br/>pleasant and happy.</p>
        <p>On the 3d of August, 1837, his little son, then a child of four years
          <br/>old went out to a swamp in the vicinity of their dwelling, with a
          <br/>hired girl, to gather whortleberries. The swamp was in the direction
          <br/>from Mr. Filley’s to the dwelling of Mr. Mount, the father of the girl,
          <br/>whither they expected to go to spend the night—and the scene of
          <br/>their toil was about a mile from the house of the former, and some
          <br/>twenty or thirty rods from the dwelling of the latter. Having satisfied
          <br/>himself with picking berries, the child displayed a desire to return,
          <br/>whereupon the girl conducted him to the road, and placed him in the
          <br/>direction to the house of Mr. Mount—not doubting, as the house was
          <br/>in plain sight, and only a few rods distant, but the little fellow would
          <br/>reach it in perfect safety. </p>
        <p>The girl returned to the swamp, and after completing her supply of
          <br/>berries, went home to the house offer father, and found to her aston-
          <br/>ishment, as well as that of the family, that William had not arrived.
          <br/>Notice was immediately given to the parents, an alarm given through
          <br/>the settlement, and the whole population rushed at once to the assist-
          <br/>ance and relief of the almost distracted parents. Day and night, for
          <br/>more than a week, the whole country, in every direction, to an extent
          <br/>of more than twenty miles, was searched with untiring vigilance.
          <br/>Every pond and stream of water was examined and dragged—and
          <br/>every rod of ground scrutinized, for many successive days, but no trace
          <br/>could be discovered of the absent child.</p>
        <p>As suspicions were entertained that foul play had been practised by
          <br/>the Indians, inquiries were made of the different tribes and families
          <br/>in the vicinity, and pecuniary offers tendered to their chiefs and influ-
          <br/>ential men, and Mr. Filley himself traversed for months the wilds of
          <br/>Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, but his efforts proved vain. No dis-
          <br/>covery could be made, and no tidings had, and he returned to his
          <br/>broken-hearted family, with the sad reflection that his William was
          <br/>lost!</p>
        <p>For seven long years this stricken family endured the agony of an
          <br/>affliction which seldom falls to the lot of human nature to submit to—
          <br/>" months of vanity and wearisome nights were appointed to them."</p>
        <p>Since the decease of his wife. Mr. Filley has visited Connecticut, the
          <br/>place of his nativity, and while here, by a mysterious course of events
          <br/>beyond the comprehension of human wisdom to fathom, his long lost
          <br/>child has appeared and been restored to his embraces.</p>
        <p>It seems that the lad, before reaching the house of Mr. Mount, was
          <br/>overtaken and kidnapped by a band of Indians, who in their wander-
          <br/>ings happened to pass that way. In this family he lived, and travelled
          <br/>with them in all their movements, from the time he was captured until
          <br/>the autumn of 1843.</p>
        <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
        <p>About this time his family visited Albany, N. Y., and while there
          <br/>this white child was discovered among them. The municipal authori-
          <br/>ties of the city becoming acquainted with the circumstance, at once
          <br/>caused their arrest, and took measures to compel them to disclose the
          <br/>means by which they became possessed of the child. They were al-
          <br/>ternately flattered and threatened, but no disclosure could be obtained,
          <br/>as they seemed resolved to submit to any punishment rather than
          <br/>make any communication by which the paternity of the child could
          <br/>be ascertained. They were therefore discharged, and the child very
          <br/>humanely placed in the Orphan Asylum.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, in the spring of 1844, Mr. Cowles, of Tolland, Mass.,
          <br/>being in want of a boy in his family, was recommended to this place,
          <br/>and furnished with this lad, whom he brought home with him to his
          <br/>residence in Tolland.</p>
        <p>In the month of December last, a most marvellous concurrence of
          <br/>circumstances, the facts in relation to this boy, so far as it concerned
          <br/>the transactions at Albany, came to the knowledge of the Rev. Dr.
          <br/>Cooley of Granville. The Dr. having frequently heard the circum-
          <br/>stances under which the child was lost, immediately communicated
          <br/>the intelligence he had obtained to Mr. Marvin, the grandfather of the
          <br/>child, and he without loss of time, made known the tidings to Mr.
          <br/>Filley, who was then with his friends in Connecticut. From the know-
          <br/>ledge thus obtained, Mr. Filley visited Mr. Cowles in Tolland, with
          <br/>whom the lad then resided.</p>
        <p>Although time and exposure had somewhat obliterated the fair fea-
          <br/>tures of his youth, his personal appearance was the counterpart of the
          <br/>other members of his family. His size, his age, the complexion of his
          <br/>eyes and hair, and all his prominent characteristics indicated those of
          <br/>his child; arid upon appealing to a known scar upon his hand, and ex-
          <br/>amining an indubitable mark in the hair of his head, his identity was
          <br/>fully recognized; and in the joy of his heart he pressed to his bosom
          <br/>his long lost son.</p>
        <p>From the story of the boy it appears that he has constantly resided
          <br/>in the same family, which consisted of four Indians—Paul Pye, Phebe
          <br/>Anne Pye, his wife, Martha Anne Pye, their daughter, and Thomas
          <br/>Williams, an inmate of the family. They adopted him as their son,
          <br/>and he was taught and believed that Paul and Phebe Aon were his
          <br/>parents, and Martha his sister. He supposed himself an Indian boy,
          <br/>and was nor aware of any difference of complexion, or distinction of
          <br/>nature, until his deliverance at Albany. He has an indistinct recollec-
          <br/>tion of attending school, but when or where he knows not.</p>
        <p>This seems to be the only remaining fact in his memory that he can
          <br/>recognize as having transpired prior to his capture, and he does not
          <br/>seem to associate this with any other fact indicative of his home, ex-
          <br/>cept that he did not go to school with the Indians.</p>
        <p>He recollects living near Detroit, Utica, Brothertown, Catskill and
          <br/>Hudson, and several months at Hillsdale, N. Y. In all their wander-
          <br/>ings in summer and winter he travelled barefoot, suffering in winter
          <br/>from cold, and at all times from hunger and fatigue ; but his Indian
          <br/>sister, like a second Pocahontas, took unwearied pains to mitigate his
          <br/>sufferings and make his captivity endurable.</p>
        <p>Although he cannot recognize his new friends, yet he rejoices that
          <br/>he has found a permanent home in a land of civilization, and all parties
          <br/>feel it their duty to render their grateful thanks to the author of all
          <br/>good for this marvellous dispensation of Providence.</p>

        <div class="head">THE CONCERT ROOM.</div>
        <div>
            <div class="head">MR. GEORGE LODER'S CONCERT.</div>
            <p>This much talked-of and long expected Concert was given at the
            <br/>Apollo Saloon on Saturday evening last. The appearance of the wea-
            <br/>ther had for several days indicated rain, but the promise was not fill-
            <br/>filled until about an hour, or so, before the Concert commenced, when
            <br/>it fell heavily. It was very unfortunate, and almost destructive to Mr.
            <br/>Loder’s hopes and just expectations. However, despite the storm,
            <br/>some five or six hundred persons assembled, and among them many of
            <br/>onr first citizens, and most accomplished amateurs.</p>
            <p>The performance commenced with Mendelssohn’s Lobegesang,
            <br/>performed by about one hundred and twenty instruments and voices:
            <br/>most of them were picked artists, chosen for their professional capa-
            <br/>bility.</p>
            <p>The Lobegesang is a Sinfonia-Cantata, consisting of three move-
            <br/>ments for the instruments—an Allegro, an Allegretto Agitato, and an
            <br/>Adagio, which are followed by choruses, duetts, and solos. The first
            <br/>movement is in B flat, in which the work also ends, and commences
            <br/>with two bars for the Trombone, in which is developed the leading
            <br/>idea,the prominent thought, which is wonderfully elaborated in this
            <br/>movement, and stands out in bold relief in almost every other piece,
            <br/>and is the phrase in the work. We might almost say that the Lobe-
            <br/>gesang is a work of one idea, embodying in music the following words
            <br/>—All that has life and breath, sing to the Lord—for the countless
            <br/>exquisite thoughts which crowd the composition, are to that one
            <br/>thought secondary and subservient. The subject of the Allegro we
            <br/>take to be the voice of Faith proclaiming aloud—" Sing to the Lord."
            <br/>This lofty and elevating strain is broken in upon by a melody of exqui-
            <br/>site beauty, hopeful and trusting in its sentiment, and symbolical of
            <br/>simple but earnest adoration, but ever and anon, the stern and un-
            <br/>yielding phrase—" Sing to the Lord"—bursts forth as warning to the
            <br/>wavering and confimation to the believer. This movement is great in
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page141"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>its design and is instrumented most massively, and yet with a variety
            <br/>which precludes all feeling of weariness. A few bars at its close in-
            <br/>troduces us to the second movement, Andante Agitato, which for the
            <br/>beauty of its melody, its tearful and plaintive sorrow, agitated and
            <br/>doubting, its exquisitely varied treatment for the orchestra, has no
            <br/>parallel in instrumental writing. To compare the great in design,
            <br/>with the comparatively trifling, it reminds us of that exquisite weeping
            <br/>song " L’Hoperduta me meschina" in Mozart’s La Nozze de Figaro. In
            <br/>the midst of this heart thrilling movement, the voice of Faith is heard
            <br/>saying in commanding tones, " Sing to the Lord." But the mourner,
            <br/>wrapped in his sorrow as in a shroud, would not be comforted; again
            <br/>and again the voice was heard, and lo! unable to resist its stem con-
            <br/>trol, the heart which grief had hardened, bows down in supplication
            <br/>and in prayer. The penitent and prayerful spirit is exquisitely pour-
            <br/>trayed in the Adagio Religioso. It is a most lovely movement; grati-
            <br/>tude, devotion, and faith break forth in every phrase in the
            measure.</p>
            <p>This Sinfonia was admirably executed; each one in the band
            <br/>seemed to vie with the other in the endeavor to produce something
            <br/>as near perfection as possible. The violins were too lew, as is usual
            <br/>in Amercan orchestras, but these few were firm and drew a vigorous
            <br/>bow. Messrs. Marks and Tyte are equal to any four men.</p>
            <p>It is impossible, we find, to notice this great work in detail, as it
            <br/>was our intention to have done, we must, therefore, content ourselves
            <br/>with mentioning a few of the prominent beauties. The recit. and aria,
            <br/>by Signor Antognini, Sing ye praise, and the chorus, All ye that cried
            <br/>unto the Lord ; duetto, Mrs. E. Loderand Miss Watson, I waited for
            <br/>the Lord, and chorus, O blessed are they, and the duett, Mrs. Loder
            <br/>and Sig. Antognini, My song shall be therefore, Thy Mercy, are such of
            <br/>the work as will be most felt by the public, for they are truly surfeited
            <br/>with beauty. The three great chorusses are, however, the first, fourth,
            <br/>and sixth.</p>
            <p>The chorusses were admirably performed, every point was taken up
            <br/>with firmness and precision, and a body of sound produced altogether
            <br/>disproportioned to the small body of singers. But difficulties become
            <br/>easy when the true spirit animates us in the struggle.</p>
            <p>Mrs. E. Loder has received so much praise on every hand for her
            <br/>beautiful and chaste execution of this difficult and classical music, that
            <br/>we need not make any further comment. Miss Watson also acquitted
            <br/>herself to the satisfaction of all, and received in the second Act, the
            <br/>heartiest applause of the evening, for her chaste and simple style of
            <br/>singing an admired ballad.</p>
            <p>Signor Antognini sang some of the music of the Lobegesang with
            <br/>much taste and expression, but his style is neither suited to our verna-
            <br/>cular, nor to the music of Mendelssohn. The genius of the German
            <br/>music is entirely opposed to the Italian school; there is no one point
            <br/>of union ; not even a half-way house. The Italian finds himself fet-
            <br/>tered by the music, and his style either becomes heavy and strained,
            <br/>or the poor music becomes unmercifully ostracised. Signor Antognini,
            <br/>however, did admirably, considering that he is not familiar with the
            <br/>language, and less familiar with the music.</p>
            <p>The Offertorium, by Henri Vieuxtemps, contains some passages of
            <br/>beauty, but we do not much admire it. It is an attempt to imitate the
            <br/>strict school of writing, but in attempting this, he has not only imita-
            <br/>ted the school, but the masters. Mozart has contributed largely to
            <br/>the Offertorium. As a vocal composition, it proves that M. Vieux-
            <br/>temps is unaccustomed to write for voices, and though the union with
            <br/>the full orchestra renders the effect somewhat imposing, we do not
            <br/>think the work will add to the fame of the author.</p>
            <p>To Mr. Loder we again give all praise and commendation. He con-
            <br/>ducted throughout the evening with judgment and firmness, and proved
            <br/>himself equal to the task he had undertaken. The cordial support and
            <br/>assistance he met with from the best of his brother Professors, must
            <br/>prove truly gratifying to him, as marking their respect and esteem.</p>
            <p>The Lobegesang should be repeated at the Tabernacle, at Fifty Cents a
            <br/>ticket, so that the people may have a chance lo hear one of the greatest com-
            <br/>positions of the present day.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class="head">THE SACRED MUSIC SOCIETY.</div>
            <p>On leaving the Tabernacle on Monday evening, we asked ourselves
            <br/>if we had heard the Messiah ? The answer was, No ! Handel’s Mes-
            <br/>siah, like Shakspeare’s plays, has become subject to travestie; the
            <br/>levelling and depreciating spirit of the age has laid its slimy hand upon
            <br/>it, and every chattering jay may libel in annotations, or emasculate by
            <br/>interpolation or emendation. In days past, and yet so recently, that
            <br/>the past is treading upon the hem of their retreating garment, in days
            <br/>scarce past, we say, the Messiah of Handel, like the Iliad of Homer
            <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>or Paradise Lost of Milton, was looked upon as the great classical
            <br/>epic, as the great musical epic, of time. It was held sacred; and
            <br/>each one deemed it incumbent upon him, within his sphere, to pre-
            <br/>serve it as much as possible, in its original and majestic purity. It
            <br/>was then graciously conceded by liberal souls, that the composer of a
            <br/>great work knew his own mind, and put down his conceptions as he
            <br/>wished them executed, while the singer considered he had enough to do
            <br/>to study to give effect and do justice to the composer’s manuscript. But
            <br/>we have fallen upon better days ; the composer’s task is easy; he has
            <br/>only to fashion the rough outline, and leave all the rest to the more
            <br/>exquisite taste, extensive knowledge and profound judgment of the
            <br/>singer, who is supposed of course to know a little more than singers
            <br/>usually do; for instance, he or she must be able to tell the name of a
            <br/>note when shewn to them, and also able to play the common chord in
            <br/>two positions. These accomplishments, considering the education
            <br/>usnally bestowed upon singers, would be acknowledged great. It will
            <br/>be therefore perceived, that the singer is now the composer, and the
            <br/>composer the drudge. " The public is therefore respectfully informed
            <br/>that the skeleton of the Messiah, by Handel, will be performed this
            <br/>evening; the principal characters by the principal singers, who will
            <br/>give an entire new version of this almost obsolete work, done up to suit
            <br/>the times. N. B. The public may rest assured that no vestige of its
            <br/>former classical style shall be allowed to remain. N. B. No. 2. Com-
            <br/>posers can have their works altered and ornamented to suit the modem
            <br/>taste and refinement, on the shortest notice. N. B. No. 3. Mendels-
            <br/>shon cooked after the Italian style, to suit the taste of the " Upper
            ten
            <br/>thousand." Such will be the announcements in future, we expect.
            <br/>Such were our reflections on listening to the Messiah on Monday
            <br/>evening. Of Madame Pico we have little to say. Unacquainted with
            <br/>the language, and a stranger to the strict style of Handel’s school, we
            <br/>expected but little, and we can only reiterate the general expression,
            <br/>that Madame Pico did extremely well—considering. The contralto
            <br/>songs lay very unfortunate for her, resting chiefly upon the middle part
            <br/>of her voice, which is comparatively weak, and thereby contrasting
            <br/>too strongly with her lower and stronger tones. Her ornaments were
            <br/>out of place, and consequently in bad taste. Some portions of the
            <br/>music she seemed to feel, and the few words she knew perfectly, she
            <br/>gave with good emphasis. But we never wish to hear Handel after
            <br/>the Italian fashion again.</p>
            <p>Miss Northall has a very good quality of voice, but the upper region,
            <br/>though clear, is thin, and has a tendency to extreme sharpness. She
            <br/>should not attempt to extend her compass beyond A, for too many
            <br/>voices arc ruined by a foolish ambition to possess an extensive com-
            <br/>pass. The consequence is, that the whole scale becomes thinned
            <br/>and weakened. With respect to Handel’s music, we state distinctly,
            <br/>that Miss N. knows nothing of its sentiment, its style, its execution.
            <br/>It cannot be sung unless it is felt and appreciated mentally. It cannot
            <br/>be sung properly unless the singer has been trained up in a strictly
            <br/>classical school, and has had constant opportunities of studying clas-
            <br/>sical models. Respectable mediocrity may be attained without this
            <br/>course, but no step higher. Miss Northall, on Monday evening, dis-
            <br/>figured her music by a host of common-place cadences, hackneyed
            <br/>closes and affected sentiment, produced by constantly slurring one note
            <br/>into another, or by continued anticipation, faults of a most vicious
            <br/>school. Her cadence at the close of Rejoice greatly was so ridiculous
            <br/>and startling, that every body doubted the evidence of their senses.
            <br/>We must now state, that we believe Miss Northall to possess good
            <br/>capabilities both mentally and physically, and we feel assured that if
            <br/>she will look more to nature, and strive to banish from her mind that
            <br/>meretricious style which offends the judicious, and palls most rapidly
            <br/>upon the multitude, we shall shortly have the pleasure of speaking
            <br/>more in her praise, than we have ever said to her prejudice.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jones executed his music with much taste. Some faults we
            <br/>might find, but he stood so preeminently superior to all who sang that
            <br/>evening, that we refrain from fault-finding, and are content to praise
            <br/>most warmly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brough never did, never could, and never can sing any thing
            <br/>that Handel ever wrote. We have warm respect for Mr. Brough as a
            <br/>man but we beg of him, for the sake of all that is classical, to connect
            <br/>himself entirely with the " Monks of Old," and such like ballads, and
            <br/>quit the legitimate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Meyer labors under many difficulties, and we feel that, con-
            <br/>sidering the circumstances, we ought to refrain fom saying all we
            <br/>know.</p>
            <p>The chorusses were extremely inefficient. Each separate chorus
            <br/>was rendered with no more of effect than an amateur church choir.
            <br/>The tempo of every chorus was was by one half too slow; the trebles
            <br/>were repeated out of tune; twenty well disciplined voices would have
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page142"/>
               <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>completely drowned the entire mass. In short, we could scarcely re-
            <br/>cognise the chorusses of Handel, so utterly were they devoid of the
            <br/>spirit and the sentiment.</p>
            <p>The band, though composed of good men, was totally inefficient;
            <br/>indeed, we speak advisedly when we say, that a worse performance,
            <br/>in relation to its advertised importance, we never witnessed in our
            <br/>life.</p>
            <p>We are sure that Mr. Hill will agree with us in all that we have
            <br/>said. The only blame which attaches to Mr. Hill is this: as con-
            <br/>ductor of the Society, he should not have allowed the performance to
            <br/>take place, knowing, as we are sure a man of his experience must
            <br/>know, that it could not redound to the credit of the Society. He re-
            <br/>trieved the singers, the chorus and the band, by his steadiness. We
            <br/>can only regret that he was not firm enough to prevent the Society
            <br/>so disgracing itself.</p>
            <p>We shall in a future number give some advice to the Government of this Society, for it
            ought to be the greatest Society in the country. </p>
            <p>The three thousand persons, including five hundred of the upper ten,
            <br/>and twenty-five hundred extremely serious people, stated by the
            <br/>Evening Mirror to have been present at Madame Pico’s Concert, have
            <br/>dwindled down to some six or seven hundred. Verily these men in
            <br/>buckram do multiply by the thousand.</p>

        <p>"The Christian Graces," written by the Rev. J. Reynell Wreford,
          <br/>F.S.A., composed by Stephen Glover. This is a sacred song well suit-
          <br/>ed for a Sabbath evening. The poetry is very beautiful, breathing a
          <br/>spirit of deep and pure devotion—penitential, yet hopeful. The mu-
          <br/>sic is simple in its character, and, if it cannot be called original, it
          is
          <br/>not offensively copied. The melody is flowing, and easy to be learn-
          <br/>ed. In the fifth bar the B flat in the treble should be A sharp.</p>
        <p>"Take back the Gems you gave me." Composed by George Linley.
          <br/>Mr. Linley is undoubtedly one of the pleasantest ballad writers of the
          <br/>day. His songs are all singable, and we occasionally find much musi-
          <br/>cian-like feeling in his writing. The ballad under notice is very pret-
          <br/>ty—quite a drawing-room piece, and is one of the most teachable
          <br/>ballads published for some time.</p>
        <p>" Dear Normandie." Written and arranged by Stanhope Gordon.
          <br/>This is a new arrangement of a well-known air. The words are very
          <br/>pretty, and well adapted to the music. It is a very pleasing song. In
          <br/>the fifth bar of the second page, the last note in the voice part should
          <br/>be E instead of D. It has a handsome and well executed lithographic
          <br/>frontispiece. The lady, however, in the foreground, if standing up,
          <br/>would measure some seven feet six inches in height.</p>
        <p>"The Rose of Tyrone." Written by Mrs. Crawford, composed by
          <br/>E. L. Hime. The words of this song are sentimental, but the music is
          <br/>in the Rory O’More style, an imitation of the regular rollicking Irish
          <br/>school. The music and the words, though wedded, are by no means
          <br/>matched. The frontispiece is the portrait of the Rose of Tyrone, full
          <br/>blown and bewitching.</p>
        <p>"Beauties of L’Elisir d’Amore," arranged for the piano forte by
          <br/>S. F. Rimbault. This is a collection of very easy arrangements of the
          <br/>most popular melodies from Donizetti’s well-known opera, the Elixir
          <br/>of Love. The pieces are fingered throughout, and will prove popular
          <br/>among beginners, serving as relaxation from severer studies.</p>

            <div class="ab">By W. C. Taylor, L.L.D., M.R.
            <br/>A.S., of Trinity College, Dublin. Revised, with a chapter on tne History
            <br/>of the United Stain, by C. S. Henry, D.D., Profenaor of Philosophy and
            <br/>History in the University of the City of New York. D. Appleton &amp; Co.,
            <br/>300 Broadway.</div>
            <p>"The use of history is not to load the memory with facts, but to
            <br/>store the mind with principles," says Dr. Taylor, in his preface ; but
            <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
               <br/>if this were true, it would be an idle labor to compress a world of facts
            <br/>into the compass that he has done in his manual; principles alone
            <br/>would have answered a better purpose. But it is an unmeaning sen-
            <br/>tence. The principles of history, like the principles of chemistry, are
            <br/>facts: we have need of nothing else. Facts are to the mind what ma-
            <br/>nure is to the soil—nothing of value will grow without them. How
            <br/>absurd it would be for a man to talk of the philosophy of history,
            <br/>whose memory was not well stored with facts. Happily for us, Dr.
            <br/>Taylor has not acted on his own theory, but has given us as many
            <br/>historical facts as could well be disposed of in 800 pages; and it is
            <br/>this, not his principles, which gives so high a value to his manual.
            <br/>There is yet no settled principle in regard to the best manner of pur-
            <br/>suing historical studies ; aud it is not probable that there ever will
            be.
            <br/>In nine cases out of ten, accident will guide the student in his choice
            <br/>of books; and elegance of style more than any other cause, will gain
            <br/>popularity for an historian. Some of the worst histories that have
            <br/>been written, are the most popular ; indeed, a good history will stand
            <br/>but little chance of popularity. If every man knew himself thorough-
            <br/>ly, he would have need of no other knowledge of mankind, for his-
            <br/>tory, which sounds so grand, is only an exceedingly imperfect account
            <br/>of the lives of men precisely like ourselves; and whether they wore
            <br/>crowns or tarpaulins, the particulars of their lives are alike valuable
            <br/>as materials for philosophy. The life of any milliner in Broadway is
            <br/>as good material for history as the life of Queen Anne. If the whole
            <br/>plan of writing histories were reversed, and the quarrels and speeches
            <br/>of corporals and hucksters from the earliest periods to the present
            <br/>time were given, we should know as much of the philosophy of the
            <br/>human mind as we do now. The most important fact to be gleaned
            <br/>from the history of mankind, is whether or not the human mind has
            <br/>improved since the creation ; and the only way to determine it is by
            <br/>comparing man at the outset with man at the present. But history
            <br/>can aid us but little here ; we must have a more reliable source than
            <br/>the records which men make of each other. The true objects for the
            <br/>student of humanity will be found in the monuments which men have
            <br/>left of their habits, like foot prints in the Band, by which we ascertain
            <br/>in what direction they have travelled. A comparison of the Astor
            <br/>House with the pyramid of Cheops, if we but knew the uses to which
            <br/>both buildings were put, will enable us to determine, better than any
            <br/>history that has been written, whether the human mind has made any
            <br/>advances during the last three thousand years.</p>
            <p>But we are undesignedly uttering all manner of heterodoxies, when
            <br/>we had only intended to call attention to the very valuable work un-
            <br/>der notice, whose original value has been enhanced by an additional
            <br/>chapter by Professor Henry, (we call him Professor, lest he be con-
            <br/>founded with Dr. Henry, the historian of England,) on the history of
            <br/>the United States, which brings down our history literally to the pre-
            <br/>sent time, giving an account of President Tyler’s Texas message to
            <br/>Congress.</p>
            <p>The work is divided into ancient and modem history, the first part
            <br/>beginning with the Egyptians and ending with the creation of the
            <br/>Western empire, and a separate chapter on India. The second part
            <br/>commences with the Gothic kingdom of Italy, and ends with the af-
            <br/>fairs of yesterday. There are also separate chapters devoted to the
            <br/>history of Colonization, the history of the Jews, and the history of
            <br/>China.</p>
            <p>As a manual of history it will be found one of the most useful, and
            <br/>at the same time most readable compends, that have been published.</p>

            <p>Anastatic Printing—About five weeks since I had an opportunity
            <br/>of seeing a practical experiment in this new and extraordinary pro-
            <br/>cess ; but as the patentee’s arrangements were not then completed, he

            <br/>tical details—or as much of them as are explained—are given In the
            <br/>Art Union for February. The invention is even more wonderful and
            <br/>certainly more Important than that for reproducing line engravings,
            <br/>as described in the January number of the same journal. It is suffi-
            <br/>cient to say here, that I desired a copy to be made of the page of a

        <p>—The point of perfection in any art or
          <br/>science is difficult to determine ; since almost every day heralds an
          <br/>improvement in some department of practical knowledge. We think
          <br/>however, that Mr. Oliver B. Goldsmith’s system of instruction in pen
          <br/>manship is as near perfection as can be attained in an art purely me-
          <br/>chanical. His writing and flourishing have been submitted to the test
          <br/>of comparison with those of his most accomplished rivals, and the re-
          <br/>sult has been the award of five premiums to Mr. G. While thus stand-
          <br/>in? at the head of his profession, Mr. Goldsmith has reduced his terms
          <br/>below those of his compeers, and we observe that he now advertises
          <br/>to give a course of lessons for $2,50, at his rooms, 189 Broadway.
          <br/>As a matter of course his classes will, on such terms, fill up rapidly.
          <br/>In the department of book-keeping, Mr. G. is assisted by Mr. W. T.
          <br/>Plummer, who is thoroughly competent to give instruction in that

          <br/>a service to the public, in recommending to their favorable notice the
          <br/>Equestrian Academy of Mr. Wm. H. Disbrow. The manner in which
          <br/>that establishment is conducted, the moderate charges, and the tout
          <br/>ensemble of its internal arrangements cannot fail, when they become
          <br/>known, to render the establishment eminently popular. The Ladies
          <br/>have peculiar advantages in the schools, as the horses are broken ex-
          <br/>pressly for their use, and as no possible accident can befal them. As
          <br/>a teacher of horsemanship Mr. Disbrow is certainly unparalleled in this
          <br/>city, at least; and all who may place themselves under his tuition,
          <br/>will derive much valuable information relative to the management of
          <br/>the horse. As the art of riding is daily becoming more necessary as
          <br/>an accomplishment to both ladies and gentlemen, we would earnestly

            <br/>per annum, in Advance.
            <br/>THE MERCHANTS’ MAGAZINE and COMMERCIAL RE-
            <br/>VIEW, embraces every subject connected with Commerce, Manufac-

            <br/>It has been, and will continue to be, the aim of the Editor and Pro-

            <br/>A WHIG JOURNAL OF POLITICS, LITERA-

            <br/>lished monthly at 118 Nassau St. New York, and by Wiley &amp; Putnam 161
            <br/>Broadway, and 6 Waterloo Place, Regent Street, London,—at Five Dollars
            <br/>per anum in advance—Single Nos. fifty cents.
            <br/>It is the aim of this Review—discarding all national and sectarian influence
            <br/>—to harmonize in a kindlier acquaintanceship the different sections of the
            <br/>country ; to set forth more clearly the inexhaustible resources of our territo-
            <br/>ry ; to elevate the morals of the people: to withstand pusillanimity at
            borne,
            <br/>and indignities abroad; to promote American science, and diffuse throughout
            <br/>the land a higher order of taste in letters and the Arts. Though established
            <br/>ostensibly on partisan grounds, the Review proposes to itself no mere party
            <br/>triumph—but the moral, social and literary welfare of the commonwealth.
            <br/>The following is from the origional Prospectus issued at Washington by
            <br/>the Whig Members of the Twenty-Seventh Congress:
            <br/>"Earnestly approving of the plan of such a national organ, long needed
            <br/>and of manifest importance, the undersigned agree to contribute for its pa-

            <br/>In addition to these, a number of writers have been enlisted for its various
            <br/>other departments, so that every number, besides strong political articles,
            <br/>will contain about 80 pages of Literary Miscellany in History, Biography,
            <br/>Criticism, Fiction, Poetry, Statistics, Science and the Arts, three or four En-
