            <div class="ab">(Second Notice.)</div>
            <p>The great defect of Miss Fuller’s book is a want of dis-
            <br/>tinctness. We can easily discover that her chief concern is
            <br/>to help remove the evils which afflict society ; but we can-
            <br/>not discover any hints of the means by which they may be
            <br/>removed. She is sufficiently learned, sufficiently vigorous,
            <br/>and sufficiently earnest, but not sufficiently plain and direct.
            <br/>We have too much of the Scandinavian mythology and the
            <br/>Greek tragedy, and too little of what the book professes to
            <br/>deal with—woman in the nineteenth century. The most di-
            <br/>rect writing is on a topic that no virtuous woman can treat
            <br/>justly, because she must of necessity be imperfectly inform-
            <br/>ed; it is exceedingly painful to read a portion of her work,
            <br/>which we feel must have been painfully produced; and
            <br/>though we cannot but respect her for her courage in printing
            <br/>it, we regret that she should have felt herself bound to do so,
            <br/>since no good can possibly result from it. There are a thou-
            <br/>sand existing evils in society which a woman may freely cen-
            <br/>sure, and a thousand topics of pervading interest which she
            <br/>may freely discuss, with profit to her sex, without verging
            <br/>towards those that the innocent had better not know the ex-
            <br/>istence of. We wish that Miss Fuller had loosened the fibula
            <br/>of her arrows, and let them fly at the practices which are, in-
            <br/>deed, the direct causes of the lewdness which she deplores,
            <br/>instead of treating of the lewdness itself, which she can only
            <br/>know by hearsay, and of course but imperfectly comprehend.</p>
            <p>The only way in which any good can be rendered to soci-
            <br/>ety, is by making woman more womanly and man more
            <br/>manly. To make sailors of women and milliners of men, is
            <br/>to have imperfect sailors and imperfect milliners. The ad-
            <br/>vocates of woman’s rights who are for putting men and wo-
            <br/>men on a level, point to France as a proof that women are
            <br/>capable of performing all the duties of men; but they would
            <br/>hardly be willing to accept of the morals or the politics of
            <br/>France, which they must do if they adopt her practices.
            <br/>The difference between the sexes in this country is all in
            <br/>favor of the women : the law of courtesy grants them every
            <br/>thing, and the law of the land gives them more than they
            <br/>could ask. The privilege of voting is one which they could
            <br/>not exercise if it were granted, and it is the only privilege
            <br/>that is withheld from them. No change can bring them any
            <br/>good, or at least no greater privileges than what they enjoy
            <br/>at present. Men labor for little else than to make women
            <br/>happy ; the cream of every enjoyment is skimmed for their
            <br/>express use, while the sour milk is drank by their lords: the
            <br/>instincts of the mass can be trusted more safely than the spe-
            <br/>culations of any individual. Men and women fall naturally
            <br/>into their proper spheres when let alone, and there can be no
            need of any violent revolutions to displace them from their
            <br/>true positions. The restraints which Miss Fuller complains
            <br/>of as hindering women from becoming blacksmiths, sailors,
            <br/>and soldiers, are the restraints which Nature has imposed,
            <br/>and which can never be overcome. As we have already said,
            <br/>the mind of woman is not endowed with the elements of
            <br/>command, because she cannot originate. There are no other
            <br/>restraints to her doing so, but her own weaknesses. Miss
            <br/>Fuller glories in the “triumphs of female authorship”; but
            <br/>we know of no woman who can claim the merit of origina-
            <br/>lity. And we have no peculiar “signs of the times” in any
            <br/>work which has appeared from a woman’s hand. In the
            <br/>Arts, where the creative faculties are tested, women have
            <br/>done nothing. Drawing and painting are considered a ne-
            <br/>cessary part of every woman’s education, but the world has
            <br/>produced no famous woman-artist of any kind; yet their
            <br/>way of life peculiarly fits them for artistic employment.
            <br/>There are no restraints upon woman in any civilised country,
            <br/>to prevent her becoming an architect; yet we have never
            <br/>heard of but one architectural work, and that a very recent
            <br/>one, produced by a female. All women are instructed in
            <br/>the rudiments of music, yet we have no female composers.</p>
            <p>The employments of women are distinct from those of
            <br/>men, and the more perfect that society becomes, the more
            <br/>distinct they will grow. Therefore, instead of its being a
            <br/>cause of complaint that women are compelled to be women,
            <br/>it should be hailed as a sign, indeed, of the incoming of bet-
            <br/>ter times.</p>
            <p>We believe that Miss Fuller admits the truth of our argu-
            <br/>ment in the following passage, although we are not sure that
            <br/>we comprehend her meaning:</p>
            <p>" The especial genius of woman I believe to be electrical in move-
            <br/>ment, imitative in function, spiritual in tendency. She excels not so
            <br/>easily in classification, or recreation, as in an instinctive seizure of
            <br/>causes, and a simple breathing out of what she receives that has the
            <br/>singleness of life, rather than the selecting and energizing of art.”</p>
            <p>Among all the “signs of the times” which Miss Fuller
            <br/>takes note of, there is none so encouraging as the following:</p>
            <p>" A woman of excellent sense said it might seem childish, but to her
            <br/>one of the most favorable signs of the times was, that ladies had been
            <br/>persuaded to give up corsets.”</p>
            <p>It is a most favorable sign indeed, and the next generation
            <br/>of men will be all the better for it. But we should be glad
            <br/>to see the candy saloons and worsted warehouses of Broad-
            <br/>way disappear along with the corset stores.</p>
            <p>Miss Fuller has a great passion for heroines. Among all
            <br/>the females that she has selected for emulation, not one has
            <br/>been taken from the pure feminine creations of Walter Scott.
            <br/>To combat a postulate of Spinoza, she has extracted a long
            <br/>poem from W. E. Channing, a character of a woman from
            <br/>the tragedy of Festus, and a monstrosity—Mother Perpetua,
            <br/>from Eugene Sue. We see no need of a resort to fiction,
            <br/>while there are Catherines, Elizabeths, and Isabellas in a-
            <br/>bundance.</p>
            <p>There are many admirable little episodes in the book, which ever and anon appear, like
            springs of tweet water
            <a href="#p146"/>
            bubbling out of a sterile soil, and charm us by their sparkles and music.
            There are too few of passages like the following:</p>
            <p>"Only in a clean body can the soul do its message fitly. The prai-
            <br/>ses of cold water seem to me an excellent sign of the age. They de-
            <br/>note a tendency to the true in life. We are now to have, as a remedy
            <br/>for ills, not orvietan, or opium, or any quack medicine, but plenty of
            <br/>air and water, with due attention to warmth and freedom in dress, and
            <br/>simplicity in diet. Every day we observe signs that the natural feel-
            <br/>ings on these subjects are about to be reinstated, and the body to
            <br/>claim care as the abode and organ of the soul.”</p>
            <p>These passages are of greater import than Miss Fulller
            <br/>seems to be aware of, or she would dwell longer upon them,
            <br/>and draw more profitable reflections from them than she has
            <br/>done. The well-being of the body is the great end of all
            <br/>moral leaching, and if this truth were most distinctly com-
            <br/>prehended, the moral preacher would not so often preach to
            <br/>so little purpose. It is the too frequent way with moral phi-
            <br/>losophers and religious teachers, to exalt the dignity of the
            <br/>soul, by treating its habitation, the body, with contemptuous
            <br/>neglect, and it is a very rare thing to find a healthy soul
            <br/>shrined in a gaudy tabernacle. God has affixed the several
            <br/>penalties against any abuse of the body, not only in the nat-
            <br/>ural laws, but in his revealed laws; yet in the days of igno-
            <br/>rance and superstition, as well as in these days of knowledge
            <br/>and refinement, men have thought they were doing God a
            <br/>service by mortifying and lacerating the form which He
            <br/>had created in his own image. The most pale, unhealthy,
            <br/>decerpit, and consumptive men in the country, are the deni-
            <br/>zens of theological seminaries, who waste their vital ener-
            <br/>gies in the vain illusion of studying God’s will. They should
            <br/>be, if they rightly interpreted His will, the rosiest, healthiest,
            <br/>happiest men in the world. Man’s first offence, which brought
            <br/>death into the world, was a wrong done to his own body ; he
            <br/>ate forbidden fruit. Whether the Mosaic cause of the fall
            <br/>be typical or literal, the lesson which it teaches is the same.
            <br/>It was a violence done to his own body that brought suffering
            <br/>upon man. and caused his expulsion from Eden. If we are
            <br/>to be restored to Paradise, the body must be restored to its
            <br/>pristine dignity and beauty, by abstaining from the forbidden
            <br/>fruit which destroys it. Shall we neglect the study of God’s
            <br/>law, then, for the laws of health? By no means: the law
            <br/>of God is the law of health. Paul preached nothing to
            <br/>Agrippa, but righteousness, temperance, and judgment.</p>
            <p>There are some things in Miss Fuller’s book, which startle
            <br/>us by their strange sound, and set us a-thinking what they
            <br/>can possibly mean ; for instance: “if there were more Marys
            <br/>there would be more virgin mothers;" and some others,
            <br/>equally enigmatical. Miss Fuller is of opinion that the ideal
            <br/>of woman is expressed to a greater height and depth in Ger-
            <br/>man literature, than elsewhere, and gives the themes of three
            <br/>ballads, as instances; one of which is as follows, a legend
            <br/>of Drachenfels.</p>
            <p>"A youth is sitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle,
            <br/>her fairy kingdom, then perfumed by the blossoming grape vines,
            <br/>which draped its bowers. They are happy; all blossoms with them,
            <br/>and life promises its richest wine. A boat approaches on the tide; it
            <br/>pauses at their feet. It brings, perhaps, some joyous message, fresh
            <br/>dew for their flowers, fresh light on the wave. No! it is the usual
            <br/>check on such great happiness. The father of the Count departs for
            <br/>the crusade ; will his sou join with him, or remain to rule their do-
            <br/>main, and wed her whom he loves t Neither of the affianced pair
            <br/>hesitate a moment. ‘ I must go with my father.’ ‘ Thou must go
            <br/>with thy father.’ It was one thought, one word. ' I will be here
            <br/>again,’ he said, ‘ when these blossoms have turned to purple grapes.
            <br/>' I hope so,’ she said, while the prophetic sense said ' no.’ And there
            <br/>she waited, and the grapes ripened and were gathered into the vintage,
            <br/>and he came not. Year after year passed thus, and no tidings; yet
            <br/>still she waited. He, meanwhile, was in a Moslem prison. Long he
            <br/>languished there without hope, till at last, his patron saint appeared
            <br/>in a vision and announced his release, but only on condition of his
            <br/>joining the monastic order for the service of the saint. And so his
            <br/>release was effected, and a safe voyage home given. And once more
            <br/>he sets sail upon the Rhine. The maiden still watching beneath the
            <br/>vines, sees at last the object of all this partial love approach. Ap-
            <br/>proach, but not to touch the strand, to which she with outstretched
            arms had rushed. He dares not trust himself to land; but in low heart
            <br/>and broken tones, tells her of Heavens will; and that he, in obedi-
            <br/>ence to his vision, is now on the way to a convent, on the river bank,
            <br/>there to pass the rest of his earthly life, in the service of the shrine.
            <br/>And then he turns his boat, and floats away from her and hope of any
            <br/>happiness in this world, but urged, as he believes, by the breath of
            <br/>Heaven. The maiden stands appalled, but she dares not murmur, and
            <br/>cannot hesitate long. She also bids them prepare her boat. She fol-
            <br/>lows her lost love to the convent gate, requests an interview with the
            <br/>abbot, and devotes her Elysian isle, where vines had ripened their
            <br/>ruby fruit in vain for her, to the service of the monastery, where her
            <br/>love was to serve. Then, passing over to the nunnery opposite, she
            <br/>takes the veil, and meets her betrothed at the altar ; and for a life-
            <br/>long union, if not the one they had hoped in earlier years.”</p>
            <p>We have marked several passages for quotation, which
            <br/>our limits which will not allow us to make. Miss Fuller
            <br/>writes vigorously, but womanly; she has gathered together
            <br/>the materials for a very profitable book ; but they are so
            <br/>loosely arranged, and so pervaded with threads of error, that
            <br/>as a whole we doubt whether the work will be productive of
            <br/>much either of good or of evil. It will, however, have one
            <br/>good effect. It will cause her to be more generally known
            <br/>than she has been; for although the reading public have
            <br/>been familiar with her name since the first appearance of
            <br/>the “Dial,” they have had but an imperfect conception of
            <br/>the exact quality of her mind.</p>

            <p>Glossary or Ecclesiastical Ornament and Costume. Compiled and illustra-
            <br/>ted from ancient authorities and examples, by A. Welby Puyin, architect.
            <br/>London, 1844. Imported by Wiley and Putnam, New York.</p>
            <p>The art of book-making has been carried to the highest
            <br/>reach of elegance in the superbly illuminated volume before
            <br/>us. Gold and color can do no more, with the aid of mani-
            <br/>pulative skill alone, in making a beautiful book. Invention,
            <br/>of course, is not looked for in a work like this, which, bril-
            <br/>liant as it appears, derives its main value from its sober
            <br/>truthfulness. It reflects, as in a mirror, the best specimens
            <br/>of mediӕval ecclesiastical ornament to be found in Europe,
            <br/>explained and illustrated by the pen of the accomplished au-
            <br/>thor, and by extracts from the works of Deorandus, Georgius,
            <br/>Bona, Catalani, Gerbert, Martene, Molaenus, Thiers, Mabil-
            <br/>lon, Ducange, etc.</p>
            <p>The plates are 73 in number, and are altogether the most
            <br/>brilliant examples of this style of illustration that we have
            <br/>ever seen ; the letter-press forms over 200 pages, which are
            <br/>copiously illustrated with wood cuts, worthy to accompany
            <br/>the other ornaments of this superb volume.</p>
            <p>Welby Pugin has done more to revive a love of mediӕval
            <br/>art, than any other man of his time ; he is a devout Catholic,
            <br/>as every genuine enthusiast in ecclesiastical architecture
            <br/>must be, and is sustained in his labors to revive the dead
            <br/>forms of a departed age, by an ardent religious faith. He is
            <br/>the true apostle of Gothic architecture, and his churches are
            <br/>the only specimens of religious structures that seem to be
            <br/>invested with that feeling of sincerity, which so charms us in
            <br/>the old cathedrals, that have been erected in Europe or
            <br/>America during the last two centuries. But even his church-
            <br/>es do not preserve the genuine character of the ecclesiastical
            <br/>buildings of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when the,
            <br/>so called, Gothic style reached its highest point of expres-
            <br/>sion. Rudeness of execution and a poverty of invention, or
            <br/>a meagreness of details in imitation, distinguished the Goth-
            <br/>ic style as much as profuseness of ornament, and grandeur
            <br/>of feeling; we cannot in a refined age imitate the barbarisms
            <br/>of a semi-civilized one, and our attempts at Gothic architec-
            <br/>ture must therefore be tame and lifeless when compared with
            <br/>the examples of this religious enthusiasm which still re-
            <br/>mains. When religious zeal burnt heretics at the stake, and
            <br/>girded a sword upon the thigh of a bishop, it was unavoida-
            <br/>ble that the same violent feeling should lavish the wealth
            <br/>of an empire upon the decorations of a house of worship, and
            <a href="#p147"/>
            that more thought should be given to the nimbus of a saint
            <br/>than to the glory of God. But in these days of colporteurs
            <br/>and Bible Societies, when Christians go to Jerusalem to con-
            <br/>vert the Musselman and not to slay him, it is a feeling close-
            <br/>ly verging upon the ludicrous, which animates men, in striv-
            <br/>ing to revive the forms and symbols of worship which be-
            <br/>longed to an age whose enlightenment was thick darkness,
            <br/>when compared with ours. But if these things appear ab-
            <br/>surd, even among Papists and Episcopalians, who do at least
            <br/>preserve the creeds, though they have long since abandoned
            <br/>the practices of their fathers, how doubly absurd must they
            <br/>appear in the dissenters who repudiate all creeds, practices,
            <br/>forms, ceremonies and vestments, which they do not invent
            <br/>themselves. Man, however, is an imitative animal, at best,
            <br/>but in the present age he is pre-eminently so, and he can do
            <br/>nothing, not even build a church, without a precedent. Some
            <br/>potent voice seems to have arrested us in our march by a com-
            <br/>mand of “about, face !” and we all stand looking backwards,
            <br/>as though we were nothing of ourselves or had nothing to
            <br/>look forward to. The last twenty years has been elaborately
            <br/>wasted in attempts to revive dead things. Even in the
            <br/>drawing rooms of our humblest citizens, we are startled by the
            <br/>appearance of fauleuils, copied after examples brought from
            <br/>the boudoirs of Louis Quartorze’s Mistresses, and there is
            <br/>scarce a house in town which has not an article of furniture
            <br/>imitated from some portion ofa Gothic cathedral; the tunacle
            <br/>of a priest of the fourteenth century is faithfully copied in a
            <br/>dandy’s robe de chambre ; and a fire poker is fashioned after
            <br/>the pastoral staff of a bishop. Were it not for the terrible
            <br/>necessities which compel mankind in ail ages to be true to
            <br/>themselves in some things, we should have nothing to show
            <br/>as evidence that we had not dwindled into apes who had no
            <br/>power to originate or invent; but we have railroads, canals
            <br/>and stores; and comfortable houses for day laborers, mon-
            <br/>strous hotels and snug little chapels of ease, where pious
            <br/>ladies may exhibit their elegant dresses, and their wearied
            <br/>husbands enjoy a quiet nap of a warm Sunday afternoon,
            <br/>as proof that we do not depend upon the past for everything.</p>
            <p>The rage for Gothic architecture and ornament we think
            <br/>must have reached its calenture in this country at this time,
            <br/>and we shall look for its cooling off when the cross shall be
            <br/>affixed to the spire of Trinity Church in Broadway. There
            <br/>are now in the course of erection in Brooklyn four churches
            <br/>in the Gothic style, so close together, that the preacher’s
            <br/>voice may be heard from each at the same time, dedicated to
            <br/>four different religions, and neither of them claiming to have
            <br/>any affinity with the religion whose outside expression they
            <br/>have endeavored to copy. One of them is a Baptist, another
            <br/>a Unitarian, a third an Episcopalian, and the fourth, shade
            <br/>of Cotton Mather defend us! the church of the Pilgrims.
            <br/>Without any reference to the religious principle involved in
            <br/>Mr. Pugin’s introduction on “Symbolism in Art,” we make
            <br/>a short extract for the sake of the sound philosophy in re-
            <br/>spect to ornamental art which it contains. We would advise
            <br/>the genius who furnishes the ornaments of a certain “illumi-
            <br/>nated" work, to procure the book and study it, not only the
            <br/>letter press, but the magnificent scroll work and diapering of
            <br/>the plates.</p>
            <p>" That Art has its fixed principles, any departure from which leads
            <br/>to inconsistency and unmeaning effect, is a truth never to be lost sight
            <br/>of. And if all art is subject to fixed laws, which define her province
            <br/>and inform her purpose ; least of all is Christian Art to be regarded
            <br/>as exempt from rule, not merely of ecclesiastical precedent, but of
            <br/>philosophical and scientific principle.—Ornament, in the true and pro-
            <br/>per meaning of the word, signifies the embellishment of that which is
            <br/>in itself useful, in an appropriate manner. Vet bjr a perversion of the
            <br/>term, it is frequently applied to mere enrichment, which deserves no
            <br/>other name than that of unmeaning detail, dictated by no rule but
            <br/>that of individual fancy and caprice. Every ornament to deserve the
            <br/>name must form an appropriate meaning, and be introduced with an
            intelligent purpose, and on reasonable grounds. The symbolical asso-
            <br/>ciations of each ornament must be understood and considered : other-
            <br/>wise things beautiful in themselves will be rendered absurd in their
            <br/>application. It is to the neglect of these principles that we may trace
            <br/>half the blunders and monstrosities that disgrace modern Art. Orna-
            <br/>ments have been regarded as mere matters of whim and caprice. Ac-
            <br/>cordingly, the most opposite styles have been mixed: and emblems
            <br/>of characters the most distinct, Christian and Pagan, ecclesiastic and
            <br/>civil, have been jumbled together in unutterable confusion. Only for
            <br/>ornament is the usual reply to an enquiry respecting the intention of
            <br/>views, detail and combinations, frequent in modem designs, although
            <br/>it is not possible for any forms or enrichments to be ornamental which
            <br/>are not appropriate and significant, if their utility extends no further.
            <br/>It has been said poetically, that, ' where use is exiled, beauty scorns
            <br/>to dwell,' and the sentiment is founded in truth and reason."</p>

            <p>IMITATION—PLAGIARISM—MR. POE’S REPLY TO THE LETTER OF
            <br/>OUTIS—A LARGE ACCOUNT OF A SMALL MATTER—A VOLUMINOUS HIS-
            <br/>TORY OF THE LITTLE LONGFELLOW WAR.</p>
            <p>In replying to the letter signed “Outis,” which appears in
            <br/>last Saturday’s “Weekly Mirror”, I find it advisable, for rea-
            <br/>sons which will be obvious as I proceed, to dismiss for the
            <br/>present the editorial “we.”</p>
            <p>For the “Evening Mirror” of January 14, before my edito-
            <br/>rial connection with the “Broadway Journal,” I furnished a
            <br/>brief criticism on Professor Longfellow’s “Waif.”</p>
            <p>In the course of my observations, I collated a poem called
            <br/>“The Death-Bed,” and written by Hood, with one by Mr. Aid-
            <br/>rich, entitled “A Death-Bed.” The criticism ended thus :</p>
            <p>We conclude our notes on the “Waif,” with the observation that,
            <br/>although full of beauties, it is infected with a moral taint—or is this a
            <br/>mere freak of our own fancy? We shall be pleased if it be so;-but
            <br/>there does appear, in this little volume, a very careful avoidance of all
            <br/>American poets who may be supposed especially to interfere with the
            <br/>claims of Mr. Longfellow. These men Mr. Longfellow can continu-
            <br/>ously imitate (is that the word?) and yet never even incidentally
            <br/>commend.</p>
            <p>Much discussion ensued. A friend of Mr. Longfellow’s pen-
            <br/>ned a defence which had at least the merit of being thorough-
            <br/>ly impartial; for it defended Mr. L., not only from the one-
            <br/>tenth of very moderate disapproval in which I had indulged,
            <br/>but from the nine-tenths of my enthusiastic admiration into
            <br/>the bargain. The fact is, if I was not convinced that in
            <br/>ninety-nine hundredths of all that I had written about Mr.
            <br/>Longfellow I was decidedly in the wrong, at least it was no
            <br/>fault of Mr. Longfellow’s very luminous friend.</p>
            <p>This well-intended defence was published in the “Mirror”
            <br/>with a few words of preface by Mr. Willis, and of postscript
            <br/>by myself.</p>
            <p>Still dissatisfied, Mr. L., through a second friend, address-
            <br/>ed to Mr. Willis an expostulatory letter, of which the Mirror
            <br/>primed only the following portion :—</p>
            <p>It has been asked, perhaps, why Lowell was neglected in this col-
            <br/>lection? Might it not as well be asked why Bryant, Dana and Hal-
            <br/>leck were neglected? The answer is obvious to any one who candid-
            <br/>ly considers the character of the collection. It professed to be, accor-
            <br/>ding to the Poem, from the humbler poets; and it was intended to
            <br/>embrace pieces that were anonymous, or which were easily accessible
            <br/>to the general reader—the waifs and estrays of literature. To put any-
            <br/>thing of Lowell’s, for example, into a collection of waifs would be a
            <br/>particular liberty with pieces which arc all collected and christened.”</p>
            <p>Not yet content, or misunderstanding the tenor of some of
            <br/>the wittily-put comments which accompanied the quotation,
            <br/>the aggrieved poet, through one of the two friends as before,
            <br/>or perhaps through a third, finally prevailed on the good
            <br/>nature of Mr. Willis to publish an explicit declaration of his
            <br/>disagreement with “all the disparagement of Longfellow”
            <br/>which had appeared in the criticism in question.</p>
            <p>Now when we consider that many of the points of censure
            <br/>made by me in this critique were absolutely as plain as the
            <br/>nose upon Mr. Longfellow’s face—that it was impossible to
            <br/>gainsay them—that we defied him and his coadjutors to say
            <br/>a syllable in reply to them—and that they held their tongues
            <br/>and not a syllable said—when we consider all this, I say,
            <br/>then the satire of the “all" in Mr. Willis’ manifesto becomes
            <br/>apparent at once. Mr. Longfellow did not see it; and I
            <br/>presume his friends did not see it. I did. In my mind’s eye
            <a href="#p148"/>
            it expanded itself thus ;—“My dear Sir, or Sirs, what will
            <br/>you have? You are an insatiable set of cormorants, it is
            <br/>true; but if you will only let me know what you desire, I
            <br/>will satisfy you, if I die for it. Be quick !—merely say what
            <br/>it is you wish me to admit, and (for the sake of getting rid of
            <br/>you) I will admit it upon the spot. Come! I will grant at
            <br/>once that Mr. Longfellow is Jupiter Tonans, and that his
            <br/>three friends are the Graces, or the Furies, whichever you
            <br/>please. As for a fault to be found with either of you, that is
            <br/>impossible, and I say so. I disagree with all—with every
            <br/>syllable of the disparagement that ever has been whispered
            <br/>against you up to this date, and (not to stand upon trifles)
            <br/>with all that ever shall be whispered against you hencefor-
            <br/>ward, forever and forever. May I hope at length that these
            <br/>assurances will be sufficient?”</p>
            <p>But if Mr. Willis really hoped anything of the kind he was mistaken.</p>
            <p>In the meantime Mr. Briggs in this paper—in the “Broad-
            <br/>way Journal”—did me the honor of taking me to task for what
            <br/>he supposed to be my insinuations against Mr. Aldrich.</p>
            <p>My reply (in the “Mirror”) prefaced by a few words from
            <br/>Mr. Willis, ran as follows:</p>
            <p>Much interest has been given in our literary circles of late to the
            <br/>topic of plagiarism.</p>
            <p>About a month ago a very eminent critic connected with this paper,
            <br/>took occasion to point out a parallelism between certain lines of Thom-
            <br/>as Hood, and certain others which appeared in the collection of Amer-
            <br/>ican poetry edited by Mr. Griswold. Transcribing the passages, he
            <br/>ventured the assertion that “somebody is a thief.” (He goes on be-
            <br/>low to speak for himself.)</p>
            <p>The matter had been nearly forgotten, if not altogether so, when a
            <br/>“good-natured friend” of the American author (whose name had
            <br/>by us never been mentioned) considered it advisable to re-collate the
            <br/>passages, with the view of convincing the public (and himself) that
            <br/>no plagiarism is chargeable to the party of whom he thinks it chivalrous
            <br/>to be the “good-natured friend.”</p>
            <p>For our own part should tee ever be guilty of an indiscretion of this
            <br/>kind, we deprecate all aid from our “good natured friends ’’—but in
            <br/>the mean time it is rendered necessary that once again we give pub-
            <br/>licity to the collation of poems in question. Mr. Hood’s lines run thus
            :</p>
          
            We watched her breathing through the night,
            Her breathing soft and low, As in her breast the wave of life
            Kept heaving to and fro.
            So silently we seemed to speak,
            So slowly moved about,
            As we had lent her half our powers
            To eke her being out.
            Our very hope belied our fears;
            Our fears our hope belied;
            We thought her dying when she slept.
            And sleeping when she died.
            But when the morn came dim and sad.
            And chill with early showers,
            Her quiet eyelids dosed ;—she had
            Another morn than ours.
          
          <div class="ab">Mr. Aldrich’s thus:--</div>
          
            Her sufferings ended with the day,
            Yet lived she at its close.
            And breathed the long, long night away
            In statue-like repose ;
            But when the sun in all its state
            Illumed the eastern skies,
            She passed through Glory’s morning gate.
            And walked in paradise.
          
          <p>And here, to be sure, we might well leave a decision in the ease to
            <br/>the verdict of common sense. But since the “Broadway Journal” in-
            <br/>sists upon the “no resemblance,” we are constrained to point out es-
            <br/>pecially where our supposed similarity lies. In the first place, then,
            <br/>the subject in both pieces is death. In the second it is the death of a
            <br/>woman. In the third, it is the death of a woman tranquilly dying.
            <br/>In the fourth, it is the death of a woman who lies tranquilly through-
            <br/>out the night. In the fifth it is the death of a woman whose " breath-
            <br/>ing soft and low is watched through the night” in the one instance and
            <br/>who “breathed the long long night away in statue-like repose” in the
            <br/>other. In the sixth place, in both poems this woman dies just at day-
            <br/>break. In the seventh place, dying just at daybreak, this woman in
            <br/>both cases, steps directly into Paradise. In the eighth place all these
            <br/>identities of circumstance are related in identical rhythms. In the
            <br/>ninth place these identical rhythms are arranged in identical metres ;
            <br/>and, in the tenth place, these identical rhythms and metres are con-
            <br/>structed into identical stanzas.</p>
            <p>At this point the matter rested for a fortnight, when a fourth
            <br/>friend of Mr. Longfellow took up the cudgels for him and
            Mr. Aldrich conjointly, in another communication to the
            <br/>“Mirror.” I copy it in full.</p>
            <div class="ab">PLAGIARISM.</div>
            <p>Dear Willis—Fair play is a jewel, and I hope you will let us have
            <br/>it. I have been much amused, by some of the efforts of your critical
            <br/>friend, to covict Longfellow of imitation, and Aldrich and others, of
            <br/>plagiarism. What is plagiarism? And what constitutes a good
            <br/>ground for the charge? Did no two men ever think aiike without
            <br/>stealing one from the other? or, thinking alike, did no two men ever
            <br/>use the same, or similar words, to convey the thoughts, and that,
            <br/>without any communication with each other? To deny it would be
            <br/>absurd. It is a thing of every day occurrence.</p>
            <p>Some years ago, a letter was written from some part of New Eng-
            <br/>land, describing one of those scenes, not very common during what is
            <br/>called “the January thaw,” when the snow, mingled with rain, and
            <br/>freezing as it falls, forms a perfect covering of ice upon every object.
            <br/>The storm clears away suddenly, and the moon comes up. The letter
            <br/>proceeds—“every tree and shrub, as far as the eye can reach, of pure
            <br/>transparent glass—a perfect garden of moving, waving, breathing chrys-
            <br/>tals. * * * Every tree is a diamond chandelier, with a whole constel-
            <br/>lation of stars clustering to every socket,” &amp;c. This letter was
            laid
            <br/>away where such things usually are, in a private drawer, and did not
            <br/>see the light for many years. But the very next autumn brought out,
            <br/>among the splendid annuals got up in the country, a beautiful poem
            <br/>from Whittier, describing the same, or rather a similar scene, in
            <br/>which is this line
            <br/>“The trees, like chrystal chandeliers,”
            <br/>was put in italics by every reviewer in the land, for the exceeding
            <br/>beauty of the imagery. Now the letter was written, probably about
            <br/>the same time with the poem, though the poem was not published till
            <br/>nearly a year after.—The writers were not, and never have been, ac-
            <br/>quainted with each other, and neither could possibly have seen the
            <br/>work of the other before writing. Now, was there any plagiarism
            <br/>here? Yet there are plenty of “identities.” The author of the let-
            <br/>ter, when urged some years after, to have it published, consented very
            <br/>reluctantly, through fear that he should be charged with theft; and,
            <br/>very probably, the charge has been made, though I have never
            <br/>seen it.</p>
            <p>May not this often occur? What is more natural? Images are not
            <br/>created, but suggested. And why not the same images, when the cir-
            <br/>cumstances are precisely the same, to different minds? Perhaps your
            <br/>critic will reply, that the caso is different alter one of the compositions
            <br/>is published. How so? Does he, or you, or anybody read everything
            <br/>that is published? I am a great admirer, and a general reader of
            <br/>poetry. But, by what accident 1 do not know, I had never seen the
            <br/>beautiful lines of Hood, till your critical friend brought them to my
            <br/>notice in the Mirror. It is certainly possible that Aldrich had not
            <br/>seen them several years ago—and more than probable that Hood had
            <br/>not seen Aldrich’s. Yet your friend affects great sympathy for both,
            <br/>in view of their better compunctions of conscience, for their literary
            <br/>piracies.</p>
            <p>But, after all, wherein does the real resemblance between these two
            <br/>compositions consist? Mr.---I had almost named him, finds nearly </p>
            <p>a dozen points of resemblance. But when he includes rhythm, metre
            <br/>and stanza among the dozen, he only shows u bitter resolution to make
            <br/>out a case, and not a disposition to do impartial justice. Surely the
            <br/>critic himself who is one of our finest poets, does not mean to deny
            <br/>that these mere externals are the common property of all bards. He
            <br/>does not feel it necessary to strike out a new stanza, or to invent new
            <br/>feet and measures, whenever he would clothe his “breathing thoughts
            <br/>in words that bum.”</p>
            <p>Again, it is not improbable that, within the period of time since
            <br/>these two writers, Hood and Aldrich, came on the stage, ten thousand
            <br/>females have died, and died tranquilly, and died just at day-break, and
            <br/>that after passing a tranquil night, and, so dying, were supposed by
            <br/>their friends to have passed at once to a better world, a morning in
            <br/>heaven. The poets are both describing an actual, and not an imagi-
            <br/>nary occurrence. And here—including those before-mentioned, which
            <br/>are common property—are nine of the critic’s identities, which go to
            <br/>make up the evidence of plagiarism. The last six, it requires no
            <br/>stretch of the imagination to suppose, they might each have seen and
            <br/>noticed separately. The most of them, one other poet at least, has
            <br/>noticed, many years ago, in a beautiful poem on these words of the
            <br/>angel to the wrestling Jacob—“Let me go, for the day breaketh.”
            <br/>Wonder if Hood ever saw that?</p>
            <p>The few remaining “identities” are, to my mind, sufficiently dis-
            <br/>posed of by what I have already said. I confess I was not able, until
            <br/>the appearance of the critic’s second paper, in which he brought them
            <br/>out specially, “marked, numbered, and labelled,” to perceive the
            <br/>resemblance on which the grave charge of literary piracy, and moral
            <br/>dishonesty of the meanest kind was baaed. In view of all the glaring
            <br/>improbabilities of such a case, a critic should be very slow to make
            <br/>such a charge. I say glaring improbabilities, for it seems to me that
            <br/>no circumstantial evidence could be sufficient to secure a verdict of
            <br/>theft in such a case. Look at it. A man, who aspires to fame, who
            <br/>seeks the esteem and praise of the world, and lives upon his reputa-
            <br/>tion, as his vital element, attempts to win his object—how? By
            <br/>stealing, In open day, the finest passages, the most beautiful thoughts
            <br/>(no others are worth stealing) and the rarest images of another, and
            <br/>claiming them as his own ; and that too, when he knows that every
            <br/>competitor for fame, and every critical tribunal in the world, as well
            <br/>as the real owner, will be ready to identify the borrowed plumes In a
            <br/>moment, and cry him down as a thief. A madam, an idiot, If he were
            <br/>capable of such an achievement, might do it, but no other. A rogue
            <br/>may steal what he can conceal in his pocket, or his chest—but one
            <br/>must be utterly non compos, to steal a splendid shawl, or a magnifi-
            <br/>cent plume, which had been admired by thousands for its singular
            <a href="#p149"/>
            beauty, for the purpose of sporting it in Broadway. In nine hundred
            <br/>and ninety-nine cases of a thousand, such charges are absurd, and in-
            <br/>dicate rather the carping littleness of the critic, than the delinquency
            <br/>of his victim.</p>
            <p>Pray did you ever think the worse of Dana because your friend,
            <br/>John Neal, charged him with pirating upon Paul Allen, and Bryant
            <br/>too, in his poem of “the dying raven?” or of yourself, because the
            <br/>same friend thought he had detected you in the very act of stealing
            <br/>from Pinckney, and Miss Francis, now Mrs. Child? Surely not.
            <br/>Every body knows that John Neal wishes to be supposed to have read
            <br/>every thing that ever was written, and never have forgotten any thing.
            <br/>He delights, therefore, in showing up such resemblances.</p>
            <p>And now—for the matter of Longfellow’s imitations—In what do
            <br/>they consist? The critic is not very specific in this charge. Of what
            <br/>kind are they? Are they imitations of thought? Why not call them
            <br/>plagiarisms then, and show them up? Or are they only verbal imita-
            <br/>tions of style? Perhaps this is one of them, in his poem on the “Sea
            <br/>Weed.”
            
              -----“drifting, drifting, drifting
              On the shirting
              Currents of the restless main.”
            
            <br/>resembling, in form and collocation only, a line in a beautiful and very
            <br/>powerful poem of Mr. Edgar A. Poe. (Write it rather Edgar, a
            <br/>Poet, and then it is right to a T.) I have not the poem before me,
            <br/>and have forgotten its title. But he is describing a magnificent intel-
            <br/>lect in ruins, if I remember rightly—and, speaking of the eloquence
            <br/>of its better days, represents it as 
              -----"flowing, flowing, flowing
              Like a river.”
            
          </p>
            <p>Is this what the critic means? Is it such imitations as this
            <br/>that he alludes to? If not, I am at fault, either in my reading of
            <br/>Longfellow, or in my general familiarity with the American Poets.
            <br/>If this be the kind of imitation referred to, permit me to say, the
            <br/>charge is too paltry for any man, who valued his reputation either as
            <br/>a gentleman or a scholar, to make. Who, for example, would wish to
            <br/>be guilty of the littleness of detracting from the uncommon merit of
            <br/>that remarkable poem of this same Mr. Poe’s, recently published in
            <br/>the Mirror, from the American Review, entitled “The Raven,” by
            <br/>charging him with the paltriness of imitation? And yet, some snarl-
            <br/>ing critic, who might envy the reputation he had not the genius to se-
            <br/>cure for himself, might refer to the frequent, very forcible, but rather
            <br/>quaint repetition, in the last two lines of many of the stanzas, as a pal-
            <br/>pable imitation of the manner of Coleridge, in several stanzas of the
            <br/>Ancient Mariner. Let me put them together.</p>
            <p>Mr. Poe says— 
            
              " Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,
              Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.”
            
            <br/>And again— 
            
              “It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore—
              Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore.”
            
            <br/>Mr. Coleridge says, (running two lines into one): 
            
              “For all averred I had killed the bird, that made the breeze to blow.
              ' Ah, wretch !’ said they, ‘the bird to slay, that made the breeze to blow.” '
            
            <br/>And again— 
              "They all averred I had killed the bird, that brought the fog and mist.
              ’ ’Twas right,’ said they, ‘ such birds to slay, that bring the fog and mist.
            
          </p>
            <p>I have before me an anonymous poem, which I first saw some five
            <br/>years ago, entitled “The Bird of the Dream.” I should like to tran-
            <br/>scribe the whole—but it is too long. The author was awaked from
            <br/>sleep by the song of a beautiful bird, sitting on the sill of his window
            <br/>—the sweet notes had mingled with his dreams, and brought to his
            <br/>remembrance, the sweeter voice of his lost “Clare.” He says—</p>
            <p>
              " And thou wert in my dream—a spirit thou didst seem—
              The spirit of a friend long since departed;
              Oh! she was fair and bright, but she left me one dark night—
              She left me all alone, and broken-hearted.
            
            <br/>* * * * * * * * 
            
              My dream went on, and thou went a warbling too, 
              Mingling the harmonies of earth and heaven ; 
              Till away—away—away—beyond the realms of day— 
              My angel Clare to my embrace was given.
            
            <br/>* * * * * * * *
            
              Sweet bird from realms of light, oh! come again to-night,
              Come to my window—perch upon my chair— 
              Come give me back again that deep impassioned strain
              That tells me thou hast seen and loved my Clare.
            </p>
            <p>Now I shall not charge Mr. Poe with Plagiarism—for, as I have
            <br/>said, such charges are perfectly absurd. Ten to one, he never saw
            <br/>this before. But let us look at the “identities” that may be made out
            <br/>between this and "The Raven.” First, in each case, the poet is a
            <br/>broken-hearted lover. Second, that lover longs for some hereafter
            <br/>communion with the departed. Third, there is a bird. Fourth, the
            <br/>bird is at the poet’s window. Fifth, the bird being at the poet’s win-
            <br/>dow, makes a noise. Sixth, making a noise, attracts the attention of
            <br/>the poet: who, Seventh, was half asleep, dosing, dreaming. Eighth,
            <br/>the poet invites the bird to come in. Ninth. a confabulation ensues.
            <br/>Tenth, the bird is supposed to be a visitor from the land of spirits.
            <br/>Eleventh, allusion is made to the departed. Twelfth, intimation is
            <br/>given that the bird knew something of the departed. Thirteenth, that
            <br/>he knew her worth and loveliness. Fourteenth, the bird seems willing
            <br/>to linger with the poet. Fifteenth, there is a repetition, in the second
            <br/>and fourth lines, of a part, and that the emphatic part, of the first and
            <br/>third. Here is a round baker's-dozen (and one to spare) of identities,
            <br/>to offset the dozen found between Aldrich and Hood, and that too,
            <br/>without a word of rhythm, metre or stanza, which should never form a
            <br/>part of such a comparison. Moreover, this same poem contains an
            example of that kind of repetition, which I have supposed the critic
            <br/>meant to charge upon Longfellow as one of his imitations--
            <br/>" Away—away—away,” &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might pursue it further. But I will not. Such criticisms only
            <br/>make the author of them contemptible, without soiling a plume in the
            <br/>cap of his victim. I have selected this poem of Mr. Poe’s, for illus-
            <br/>trating my remarks, because it is recent, and must be familiar to all
            <br/>the lovers of true poetry hereabouts. It is remarkable for its power,
            <br/>beauty, and originality, (out upon the automaton owl that has pre-
            <br/>sumed to croak out a miserable parody—I commend him to the ten-
            <br/>der mercies of Haynes Bayley,)  and shows more forcibly than any
            <br/>which I can think of, the absurdity and shallowness of this kind of
            <br/>criticism.</p>
            <p>One word more,—though acquainted with Mr. Longfellow, I have
            <br/>never seen Mr. Aldrich, nor do I even know in what part of the coun-
            <br/>try he resides ; and I have no acquaintance with Mr. Poe. I have
            <br/>written what I have written from no personal motives, but simply be-
            <br/>cause, from my earliest reading of reviews and critical notices, I have
            <br/>been disgusted with this wholesale mangling of victims without rhyme
            <br/>or reason. I scarcely remember an instance where the resemblances
            <br/>detected were not exceedingly far-fetched and shadowy, and only per-
            <br/>ceptible to a mind pre-disposed to suspicion, and accustomed to split-
            <br/>ting hairs.</p>
            <div class="ab">OUTIS.</div>
            <p>What I admire in this letter is the gentlemanly grace of
            <br/>its manner, and the chivalry which has prompted its com-
            <br/>position. What I do not admire is all the rest. In especial,
            <br/>I do not admire the desperation of the effort to make out a
            <br/>case. No gentleman should degrade himself, on any grounds,
            <br/>to the paltriness of ex-parte argument; and I shall not insult
            <br/>Outis at the outlset, by assuming for a moment that he (Outis)
            <br/>is weak enough, to suppose me (Poe) silly enough, to look
            <br/>upon all this abominable rigmarole as anything better than a
            <br/>very respectable specimen of special pleading.</p>
            <p>As a general rule in a case of this kind, I should wish to
            <br/>begin with the beginning, but as I have been unable, in run-
            <br/>ning my eye over Outis’ remarks, to discover that they have
            <br/>any beginning at all, I shall be par.doned for touching them
            <br/>in the order which suits me best</p>
            <p>Outis need not have put himself to the trouble of inform-
            <br/>ing his readers that he has “some acquaintance with Mr.
            <br/>Longfellow.”</p>
            <p>It was needless also to mention that he did not know me.
            <br/>I thank him for his many flatteries—but of their inconsisten-
            <br/>cy I complain. To speak of me in one breath as a poet, and
            <br/>in the next to insinuate charges of “carping littleness,” is
            <br/>simply to put forth a flat paradox.</p>
            <p>When a plagiarism is committed and detected, the word
            <br/>“littleness" and other similar words are immediately brought
            <br/>into play. To the words themselves I have no objection
            <br/>whatever; but their application might occasionally be im-
            <br/>proved.</p>
            <p>Is it altogether impossible that a critic be instigated to the
            <br/>exposure of a plagiarism, or still better, of plagiarism gener-
            <br/>ally wherever he meets it, by a strictly honorable and even
            <br/>charitable motive? Let us see. A theft of this kind is com-
            <br/>mitted—for the present we will admit the possibility that a
            <br/>theft of this character can be committed. The chances of
            <br/>course are, that an established author steals from an un-
            <br/>known one, rather than the converse; for in proportion to the
            <br/>circulation of the original, is the risk of the plagiarism’s de-
            <br/>tection. The person about to commit the theft, hopes for im-
            <br/>punity altogether on the ground of the reconditeness of the
            <br/>source from which he thieves. But this obvious considera-
            <br/>tion is rarely borne in mind. We read a certain passage in a
            <br/>certain book. We meet a passage nearly similar, in another
            <br/>book. The first book is not at hand, and we cannot compare
            <br/>dates. We decide by what we fancy the probabilities of the
            <br/>case. The one author is a distinguished man—our sympa-
            <br/>thies are always in favor of distinction. “It is not likely,”
            <br/>we say in our hearts "that so distinguished a personage
            <br/>as A. would be guilty of plagiarism from this B. of whom
            <a href="#p150"/>
            nobody in the world has ever heard.” We give judgment,
            <br/>therefore, at once against B. of whom nobody in the world
            <br/>has ever heard; and it is for the very reason that nobody in
            <br/>world has ever heard of him, that, in ninety-nine cases out of
            <br/>the hundred, the judgment so precipitously given is errone-
            <br/>ous. Now then the plagiarist has not merely committed a
            <br/>wrong in itself—a wrong whose incomparable meanness
            <br/>would deserve exposure on absolute grounds—but he, the
            <br/>guilty, the successful, the eminent, has fastened the degra-
            <br/>dation of his crime—the retribution which should have over-
            <br/>taken it in his own person—upon the guiltless, the toil-
            <br/>ing, the unfriended straggler up the mountainous path of Fame.
            <br/>Is not sympathy for the plagiarist, then, about as sagacious
            <br/>and about as generous as would be sympathy for the murder-
            <br/>er whose exultant escape from the noose of the hangman
            <br/>should be the cause of an innocent man’s being hung? And
            <br/>because I, for one, should wish to throttle the guilty with the
            <br/>view of letting the innocent go, could it be considered pro-
            <br/>per on the part of any “acquaintance of Mr. Longfellow’s”
            <br/>who came to witness the execution—could it be thought, I
            <br/>say either chivalrous or decorous on the part of this “acquain-
            <br/>tance” to get up against me a charge of “carping littleness,”
            <br/>while we stood amicably together at the foot of the gal-
            <br/>lows?</p>
            <p>In all this I have taken it for granted that such a sin as
            <br/>plagiarism exists. We are informed by Outis, however, that
            <br/>it does not. “I shall not charge Mr. Poe with plagiarism,”
            <br/>he says, “for, as I have said, such charges are perfectly ab-
            <br/>surd.” An assertion of this kind is certainly funny (I am
            <br/>aware of no other epithet which precisely applies to it) ; and I
            <br/>have much curiosity to know if Outis is prepared to swear to
            <br/>its truth—holding right aloft his band, of course, and kissing
            <br/>the back of D’Israeli’s “Curiosities,” or the “Melanges," of
            <br/>Suard and André. But if the assertion is funny (and it is) it is
            <br/>by no means an original thing. It is precisely, in fact, what
            <br/>all the plagiarists and all the “acquaintances” of the plagi-
            <br/>arists since the flood, have maintained with a very praise-
            <br/>worthy resolution.</p>
            <p>The attempt to prove, however, by reasoning à priori, that
            <br/>plagiarism cannot exist, is too good an idea on the part of
            <br/>Outis not to be a plagiarism in itself. Are we mistaken?—
            <br/>or have we seen the following words before in Joseph Miller,
            <br/>where that ingenious gentleman is bent upon demonstrating
            <br/>that a leg of mutton is and ought to be a turnip?</p>
            <p>“A man who aspires to fame, etc. attempts to win his ob-
            <br/>ject—how? By stealing, in open day, the finest passages,
            <br/>the most beautiful thoughts (no others are worth stealing)
            <br/>and claiming them as his own ; and that too when he knows
            <br/>that every competitor, etc., will be ready to cry him down as
            <br/>a thief.”</p>
            <p>Is it possible?—is it conceivable that Outis does not here
            <br/>see the begging of the whole question. Why, of course, if
            <br/>the theft had to be committed “in open day" it would not be
            <br/>committed; and if the thief “knew" that every one would cry
            <br/>him down, he would be too excessive a fool to make even a
            <br/>decent thief if he indulged his thieving propensities in any
            <br/>respect. But he thieves at night—in the dark—and not in
            <br/>the open day (if he suspects it), and he does not know that he

        <div class="head">THE ART OF THE USE OF COLOR IN IMITATION IN PAINTING.</div>
        <br/>
        <div class="ab">NO. IV.
          <br/>BY <span class="person" id="">WILLIAM PAGE</span>.</div>
        <p>No, all the outcry that has been made against imitation,
          <br/>and in favor of the ideal, anti-natural, is most unadulterated
          <br/>cant, and though propped up by the words of Reynolds, and
          <br/>innumerable blind followers, his works, that is, the best of
          <br/>them, give his theory the lie direct, being, so far as his means
          <br/>or knowledge extended, the merest imitations of the things
          <br/>before him, with certainly no exaltation of character. No one
          <br/>who remembers the portrait of Baron Heathfield, I think, as
          <br/>the defender of Gibraltar, will believe that there is any poetic
          <br/>license taken, in the way of elevating the character—it is the
          <br/>most upright and downright plain old fellow that you would
          <br/>meet in a day’s march. And as for elevation, I have seen
          <br/>some of our independent beggars, who presented as much the
          <br/>look of tough endurance, and importance, as well as self-de-
          <br/>pendence, as this celebrated picture conveys, though I judge
          <br/>it through such copies as I ha ve seen in print and otherwhere,
          <br/>enough generally to enable any intelligent observer to judge
          <br/>fairly, or favorably at least, of most English pictures. Though
          <br/>Sir Joshua says so much about elevating nature by true art,
          <br/>he did not mean in color, and I don’t know that there is a
          <br/>line in his discourses that can be construed into such a sense,
          <br/>or nonsense rather; but after talking a great deal about it, he
          <br/>says that, after all, “in comparison with Nature, the best col-
          <br/>ored pictures are but faint and feeble.” And indeed, the cri-
          <br/>tics who condemn Titian to the lowest as a designer of form,
          <br/>because he has imitated the shape of the model before him,
          <br/>laud him to the skies because in the color he has imitated his
          <br/>model perfectly. And what do these wiseacres suppose that
          <br/>he would choose a model for—for form? Raffaelle might
          <br/>have thought about this property, but the great Venetian had
          <br/>eye and mind for color, and color was his first thought, form
          <br/>was a secondary consideration—all things sang color to him,
          <br/>and a grand concert they made of it too, and a scarcely less
          <br/>harmonious accompaniment did he play. In fact, the color of
          <br/>Nature is so fair, it is so unapproachable by art, so ever
          <br/>charming, infinitely varied, yet so gentle and subdued, so
          <br/>palpably introduced in the works of God, for beauty, not
          <br/>utility, that we say, yes, there is no ideal in color beyond the
          <br/>real. This is perfect. All the contrivances of man may not
          <br/>attain to even the perfect imitation of this quality. But in
          <br/>form and expression, say the same worshippers of themselves,
          <br/>we only are perfect. But let them rest for the present; the
          <br/>time will come for their dry bones to be shaken into powder,
          <br/>and their dryer theories to crumble into dust with them, leav-
          <br/>ing but a heap of ashes for the winds to scatter as they list.
          <br/>If we take a few solid pigments representing the primary
          <br/>colors, together with white and black, and mix them to-
          <br/>gether in all possible gradations, straining the sense to divide
          <br/>and subdivide them with the greatest subtlety, we may, per-
          <br/>haps, reach to the number of some few thousand tints suffi-
          <br/>ciently distinct to be distinguished by the eye as being differ-
          <br/>ent, and that is all. But if one single compound color, Orange
          <br/>for instance, be made by mixing two opaque colors, one Red
          <br/>and the other Yellow, together forming an Orange, and this
          <br/>be laid aside, then another Orange color be formed by paint-
          <br/>ing a Yellow over a Red, and placed beside the first, a third
          <br/>then formed by painting a Red over a Yellow, and disposed
          <br/>in like manner as the other two, then another a lighter Red
          <br/>over a darker Yellow, and again a lighter Yellow over a
          <br/>darker Red, we could go on, on this principle, multiplying
          <br/>this one infinitely, and yet always producing a distinctive
          <a href="#p151"/>
          character that a nice eye would discern and enjoy. And it is
          <br/>by this means that Nature ekes out her unmeasured treasures,
          <br/>to make a fuller, richer, more varied bouquet, for the dainty
          <br/>eye of man. And yet we painters will do without this: we’ll
          <br/>take a shorter way, mixing together our muddy tints, thereby
          <br/>making them still muddier, holding up the pallette-knife, and
          <br/>match all that Nature herself did, only by her finer Art: we
          <br/>have no need of any such niceties—we see deeper than Na-
          <br/>ture’s laws, and have a short-cut tunnel under them, where-
          <br/>by we reach it much more conveniently. We have no need
          <br/>to separate the accidental from the local, and then we will
          <br/>cheat all eyes into the belief that no such things exist in na-
          <br/>ture, more than in our pictures—so we will patch over what
          <br/>is to be taken for a piece of white drapery, with all the colors
          <br/>of earth and heaven, and make people see that these colors
          <br/>have nothing to do with the white drapery, but are only
          <br/>made to represent the light and shade, folds, &amp;c.</p>
        <p>I have repeatedly had young painters—not always young
          <br/>men, who have called upon me from the country and more
          <br/>inland cities, complain of the want of discrimination in the far-
          <br/>mers and others, their patrons or employers, because, forsooth,
          <br/>the good old common sense people, when they had been
          <br/>plastered on to the threads of a canvass, by these aspirants
          <br/>after artistic honors, meekly inquired why Mr. Charcoal, the
          <br/>artist, had represented them as snuff-takers, as he had evi-
          <br/>dently intended to do, because he had made a broad patch of
          <br/>that doubtful color, beneath the organ to which that peculiar
          <br/>form of the weed is usually addressed. Then, I have said,
          <br/>Mr. C., it seems to me that he, the farmer you speak of, has
          <br/>decidedly the advantage of you, and that, as a critic, he has
          <br/>fairer pretensions than you can claim as an artist, for if you
          <br/>had sold your shadow to the evil one, this good critic, who
          <br/>never saw such a thing in his life, would never have miss-
          <br/>ed it, but the patch which you introduced beneath his nose
          <br/>in your portrait, he didn’t know the meaning of, because it
          <br/>did not look like a shadow as intended, but like what he
          <br/>mistook it for. So, when what you mean for shadow is mis-
          <br/>took lor snuff, be sure that it is not a fair representation.
          <br/>Your flesh must be seen with all its qualities, as well in the
          <br/>shadows as in the lights. So, when a landscape painter
          <br/>would represent a distant mountain, he mixes up together
          <br/>all the local colors of things, and the atmosphere which
          <br/>makes it look blue, and we have the qualities altogether
          <br/>producing such mountains, though intended to appear miles
          <br/>away, as cheat no sense but that of the painter. And such
          <br/>sky, upright as a wall, and hard enough to tempt an unfor-
          <br/>tunate, who had resolved on suicide, to rush headlong
          <br/>against it as the most solid substance he can find, to rid him-
          <br/>self of his brains. He paints in his picture two cloaks, red
          <br/>cloaks for instance, such as were once in the same piece of
          <br/>cloth, consequently of one color, one of these cloaks is twice
          <br/>as far from the eye of the spectator as the other. So be
          <br/>mixes his blue color with the red of the cloak—the blue to
          <br/>represent the greater distance of this cloak from the eye than
          <br/>that of the other, but in reality this blue makes the cloak a
          <br/>different color, produced by more light between it and the eye
          <br/>of the spectator. The true way to paint it, indubitably is, after
          <br/>having by the linear perspective made the necessary differ-
          <br/>ence in the size of the two objects to represent their places in
          <br/>the picture, to paint them of the same color, and when it
          <br/>has become dry, pass light over them in unequal quantities,
          <br/>the one being at double distance from the eye, having a
          <br/>double quantity of light over its local color, by which that
          <br/>local color will be undisturbed, and the accidental color will
          <br/>be kept separate from the thing itself as it should evidently
          <br/>he, and a more perfect imitation than can possibly be attain-
          
          <br/>ed by any other means known will follow. No sky ever
          <br/>was or can be truly represented, unless some of this using
          <br/>the principle existent in the thing itself be adopted, any more
          <br/>than the conch shell, the inside of which is by so many sup-
          <br/>posed to resemble the color of flesh, can be used as a model
          <br/>! from which to represent that substance. The color of this
          <br/>shell, if you break and examine its structure, will be found a
          <br/>wash or transparent glaze upon a white surface, through
          <br/>which glaze the light illuminates the white beneath, and is
          <br/>reflected back to the eye, often with great brilliancy, but not
          <br/>sufficiently like flesh to make it deserve to be so often com-
          <br/>pared with it, much less to serve as a lesson of the mode to
          <br/>be adopted by the painter to imitate that more complicated
          <br/>substance ; and yet this mode is the one most in repute at
          <br/>present, as the best for painting flesh, being that of finishing
          <br/>it by glazing a color over a white, until the tone desired is
          <br/>attained. What we should learn from it (the shell) is how
          <br/>to paint that, and how not to paint flesh. When rightly
          <br/>painted, the eye sees that there is more under than it can
          <br/>reach; it looks into the red beneath the colorless surface of
          <br/>the skin, and recognises an intense hue that is actually pre-
          <br/>sented. So in all the works of Nature is this unfathomable
          <br/>depth, leading us on to see more and more by increased effort,
          <br/>and yet hiding the end ever from our reach. So does true
          <br/>Art, and in its smallest product can be seen its highest princi-
          <br/>ples, as in the pebble on the seashore, may be found subjects
          <br/>of as high and sublime thought and grand association, as in
          <br/>the circling of the planets round their suns, or the going and
          <br/>returning of the comets. What art would do is only to fix
          <br/>some of those fleeting beauties, that, though numberless, are
          <br/>ever passing, and with such rapidity before our eyes, that it
          <br/>is long before we learn to see them; but he would stay their
          <br/>flight, that the eye may look upon and contemplate them at
          <br/>its leisure, and so, when the poor feeble artist has done his
          <br/>best, the world wonders at his product, and, because he has
          <br/>never seen these things before, it deems it a new creation, and
          <br/>a higher one than has before existed. Away with such flat-
          <br/>tery ; let each fix what each best sees and knows, and the
          <br/>garden of art will again blossom with fresh beauties.</p>

        <p>Of all the various causes which may be assigned for the
          <br/>superabundance of inferior authorship, so much complained
          <br/>of among readers, perhaps the most frequent may be
          <br/>found in that terrible necessity for expression, which in many
          <br/>minds is even more powerful than the “strong necessity of
          <br/>loving.” Yet the world rarely understands this. Ambition,
          <br/>avarice, and above all, vanity, are regarded as propellants
          <br/>to literary labor, while a yearning for sympathy, a desire for
          <br/>repose, an irrepressible longing to claim kindred with conge-
          <br/>nial hearts, are feelings which are rarely believed in, or ap-
          <br/>preciated. The practical part of the world, who live on from
          <br/>day to day, governed only by the exigencies of the moment,
          <br/>and yielding to the expediencies of the passing hour, can have
          <br/>no idea of such needs. They find sufficient utterance in the
          <br/>gossip of petty scandal, the discussion of minor political ques-
          <br/>tions, or the detail of every day business. They eat, drink,
          <br/>sleep, and read newspapers; while the real energies of their
          <br/>nature are all expended in the task of gain. They live for
          <br/>bargaining and trading; they feel no vacancy of soul, because
          <br/>they have filled that temple of the living God with the ta-
          <br/>bles of the money changers.</p>
        <a href="#p152"/>



        
        <p>But to those who think deeply, and feel vividly, expres-
          <br/>sion is a necessity of their being ; they must “speak or die.”
          <br/>Some find their utterance in the interchange of socialities,
          <br/>some in discoursing elegant music, some speak in the word-
          <br/>less tints of painting, some few work out the ideal of their
          <br/>souls in the enduring marble, and some send forth their
          <br/>thoughts, winged by poesy, to the far winds of heaven.
          <br/>Yet there are still left many to whom are denied all these
          <br/>resources. There are some who have all the elements of
          <br/>power within them, but have never had their lips touched
          <br/>with the live coal from the altar, which was to the prophet,
          <br/>both inspiration and expression. There are some who seem
          <br/>like Zacharias, to be struck dumb by the very power which
          <br/>brings the promise of blessing: some to whom self-distrust
          <br/>is an incubus upon the mind, exciting it to uneasy activity,
          <br/>yet deterring it from utterance.</p>


        
        <p>Without putting forth any pretension to the possession of
          <br/>the higher order of such power, I may yet claim to know
          <br/>something of the discomforts attendant upon compulsory
          <br/>silence. I have outlived all the associates of very early life,
          <br/>and my unconquerable shyness of temper has prevented me
          <br/>from forming new ones. I have a large circle of acquaintance,
          <br/>and many family friends, but not one to whom I can open
          <br/>my inner heart. I have a competent fortune, refined tastes,
          <br/>and, I think, warm affections, yet I lead the life of a hermit,
          <br/>as far as the social sympathies are concerned. In the opinion
          <br/>of the world I have all the means of happiness within my
          <br/>reach, but all these gifts are marred by the want of a power
          <br/>which is so generally possessed, that, like the blessings of
          <br/>light and air, people scarcely value it; I mean the power of
          <br/>expressing my overburdened mind in words.</p>

        <div class="head">Letter from James Given in New York, to his Cousin Hugh Hughes, of Pool Lane,
          Liverpool.</div>
        <div class="ab">Globe Hotel, March 3, 1845.</div>
        <div class="ab">Dear Hughey,</div>
        <p>It is a whole year (mercy, how the time has flown !) since I wrote you last. I was then
          at “Maple Hill” with the Myrtles, with my
          <br/>eyes wide open to see every thing, and my heart as soft, and almost as pure, as a
          lump of virgin wax. It received an impression from every
          <br/>thing that touched it, but as I felt it growing harder and harder every day, I was
          resolved not to pen another line until its first impressions
          <br/>were either obliterated altogether, or hardened into a durable form.</p>
        <p>First impressions, you must know, my dear Hughey, are always wrong ; therefore the
          reports of a transient visitor to any country, and to
          <br/>this one in particular, should be received with great distrust. Going from one
          country to another is like going from the sunshine into a dar.
          <br/>kened room. You think at first that it contains nothing. By degrees you perceive here
          a table, there a chair, a sofa, a mantel clock, a book-
          <br/>case, a mirror, a picture, and a young lady; until at last you find that
          it is a well furnished room, like any other one. This I must confess,to
          <br/>you was exactly my case, when I first landed in New York. I could see nothing the
          first few days, but I soon began to recover my sight, und
          <br/>then things wore a familiar look to me, and every morning I got up with changed
          impressions of the country, the people, the laws, the cli-
          <br/>mate, the fruits, the flowers, the habits, the every thing. Every day I
          feel myself less an Englishman; and if not more a Yankee, at least
          <br/>more a man of the world. Once I thought that England was the universe, and Pool lane
          the best place in it; but all that is changed, and
          <br/>I can now honestly declare, that I believe there are as good places in England as
          Pool lane, and much better places in the universe than
          <br/>England. Something has bewitched me—the blue skies, perhaps, or perhaps you will say,
          the blue eyes. But I will not tell you now. But
          <br/>I will tell you one thing now : towards you, dear Hughey, I am still unchanged, and I
          still think, in truth I know, that there is not another so
          <br/>good a fellow, so true a friend, so companionable a companion, in or out of England,
          as yourself. Take my honest word for it, and make no
          <br/>doubt of it. This of course you will not tell; but do oblige me and say nothing about
          the rest, for fear that somebody in Bold street, no mat-
          <br/>ter who, should think that I am estranged.</p>
        <p>I believe that I mentioned in one of my first letters something about Franklin Myrtle, a
          young American artist with whom I had
          <br/>become intimate, who has half a dozen sisters and to forth. He is a capital good
          fellow and a promising artist; some of his sketches art
          <br/>the best I have ever seen, of the kind. I will give you a specimen, or at least he
          shall, for he is at my elbow, and he says that he will add
          <br/>something as a tail piece to my letter, if I will spare him a blank inch or two.</p>
        <p>To-day is the last of the Tyler dynasty. You are probably so ignorant as not to know what
          that is, and I have not room to tell you fully,
          <br/>but I will another time. You must know that the people of this country, or the Whigs
          rather, four years ago, made themselves a President,
          <br/>somewhat after the manner of Frankenstein, who no sooner began to feel hit strength
          than he made use of it to destroy hit makers. Frank,
          <br/>you must know, was one of those who helped to make him, and of course he feels very
          sore on the subject. He calls him a Flibbertigibbet
          <br/>and tells the most amusing stories of hit pranks and grimaces. But to-day he goes out
          of power. The strong hand of Destiny is upon
          <br/>him, and Frank says he is boxed for eternity. He says that an idea has struck him,

        <p>No person of proper feeling can peruse the works of a distinguished author or authoress
          (the latter is a very absurd word, to be sure, but
          <br/>for that very reason the more necessary,) without an instantaneous desire to make his
          (or her) personal acquaintance—provided always that
          <br/>the said author (or authoress) has not committed himself (or herself) to the extent
          of perpetraying criticisms full of "carping littleness" upon
          <br/>the last "Sonnet to the Katy-Did,” or the next to the last “Sonnet to the
          Katy-Did’nt,” composed by the person of proper feeling afore-
          <br/>said—for, in such a case as we have imagined, the identical "proper
          feeling” of which we speak, would of course induce the person to get
          <br/>as far away from the critic as possible. But, as a general rule, we are always
          inquisitive about the physical appearance of a celebrated au-
          <br/>thor; and it is but a sort of corrollary from this proposition, that if
          we are prevented by unhappy circumstances, from beholding the author
          <br/>himself, we still entertain a longing to see his portrait. If we cannot see this, we
          get his autograph if possible—but if this again is not to be
          <br/>discovered, we then regard ourselves as unfortunate beings and subject to an especial
          dispensation on the part of Providence.</p>
        <p>It is with a view of ministering to this very commendable curiosity that we furnish our
          readers, this week, with the subjoined engraving.—
          <br/>It either is, or ought to be, an accurate portrait of one of the most distinguished
          of American authoresses. We are not quite sure that we
          <br/>have ever seen a more striking likeness, and we presume it will be recognized at once
          by all who have ever met the original. We might pick
          <br/>out, perhaps, a few material points of variation, and we would do so upon the spot,
          were it not for fear of offending the artist, who is an ex-
          <br/>ceedingly sensitive person. But for this, we would say, for example, that
          the nose is a little—a very little too Grecian.—That the “fine
          <br/>phrenzy” of the eyes has not been preserved so decidedly as it should be—that the
          chin has too shrewish a character—that the little finger
          <br/>of the left hand is too straight (or perhaps a little too crooked)—that the table is
          too round—the feather of the pen too feathery—and the
          <br/>Ink (as far as we can judge of it through a metal ink-stand,) too blue. We forbear to
          give the name of the original, because, in the case of
          <br/>the ladies, an editor must be cautious how he deals in personalities—and we cannot be
          sure of not having an invitation to Hoboken forthwith.
          <br/>The name, however, is a point of no consequence. The portrait will be recognised the
          world over—if not, the fault will lie in that rather
          <br/>unusual acidity of expression worn at present by the fail lady, who happens to be
          engaged in a perusal of one of our criticisms upon her ante-
          <br/>penultimate ode “To the Universe.”</p>

        <p>I cannot talk. An unfortunate impediment in my speech,
          <br/>which is always increased by any nervous excitement, is one
          <br/>obstacle; but another, and more insuperable one, is my un-
          <br/>conquerable shyness and self-distrust. I enjoy society with
          <br/>my whole heart. I listen to brilliant conversation, (for I
          <br/>number among my friends some of the best talkers I ever
          <br/>heard), and within my own mind I take full part in it. Ready
          <br/>rejoinders, sparkling repartees, unanswerable arguments,
          <br/>profound reflections, high-toned moralizing, and all the varied
          <br/>forms of spoken eloquence, are wrought out in the chambers
          <br/>of mine imagery. Sometimes I delude myself with the be-
          <br/>lief that I have really contributed my proportion of amuse-
          <br/>ment to the social circle. My fancies are so vivid that it
          <br/>often seems to me as if I had actually uttered all the fine
          <br/>things which have been passing through my mind. I have
          <br/>often pleased myself with such a belief, and have experienc-
          <br/>ed for a moment, all the satisfaction of a man who has acted
          <br/>well his part in society, until some trivial recollection has
          <br/>brought me back to the consciousness that mine had been
          <br/>only an “imaginary conversation,” a sort of vivification of
          <br/>birth-strangled ideas.</p>
        <p>How can one like me, find expression? My mind is too
          <br/>active for continued silence; it hives up stores of knowledge,
          <br/>it accumulates masses of facts, it fashions images of beauty,
          <br/>it works out conceptions of goodness and greatness. Why
          <br/>then must it be ever dumb, when it would utter the oracles
          <br/>of nature and truth? I am resolved. I will take my hum-
          <br/>ble pen, and surrounded by my books, those quiet friends,
          <br/>whose silence is so suggestive,—I will imprison in written
          <br/>words the busy fancies which so disturb my peace. Crude
          <br/>and ill arranged as my ideas may seem, they will perhaps
          <br/>give out glimpses of something better to come. There is
          <br/>more in me than I can now utter, but a true word was never
          <br/>yet spoken in vain, and it may be that some one will become
          <br/>the happier for having picked up a rough-hewn thought from
          <br/>my quarry.</p>
        <p>I do not flatter myself that mine is an unusual case, or
          <br/>that I possess the genius which demands freedom. There is
          <br/>no condition of life to which the history of human nature
          <br/>does not afford numberless parallels, and one of the grand
          <br/>mistakes which make the wretchedness of mortals, is the
          <br/>belief in a peculiar destiny of suffering. Therefore I know
          <br/>that thousands have felt as I do, and could doubtless have
          <br/>expressed their feelings better. As for genius, that is a gift
          <br/>of God, vouchsafed, once in an age, to the world. Men of
          <br/>talents may be counted by hundreds, men of learning by
          <br/>thousands, but men of genius must still be numbered by
          <br/>tens, although the world is six thousand years old. Besides,
          <br/>Genius comes with a commission from the Most High; it
          <br/>cannot be silent even if it would.</p>
        <p>But I am wearied of ceaseless commune in the shyness of
          <br/>my own heart, wearied of perpetual activity and unbroken
          <br/>silence. I would fain speak, aye, speak without feeling the
          <br/>eye of ridicule scorching my cheek,—without having my ear
          <br/>pained by the half inarticulate sounds that fall from my
          <br/>stammering lips,—without feeling in every vein the throb of
          <br/>that terrible silence which always follows any attempt at
          <br/>vocal utterance.</p>
        <p>It may be that old age is creeping upon me apace, and
          <br/>that I grow garrulous as I grow grey. It may be that I am
          <br/>mistaken in thinking I have any thing to say. If so, I shall
          <br/>soon learn my error, for nothing is so severe a trial of one’s
          <br/>crude fancies as the sight of them in print. We all have
          <br/>our imaginings, but when the “soul of our thoughts” first
          <br/>appears before us in actual form and type, we feel very
          <br/>much as if we looked upon an apparition from the world of
          <br/>shadows, and like the witch of Endor, we are terrified before
          <br/>the spectre we have ourselves called forth.</p>

            Ye who, passing graves by night,
            Glance not to the left nor right
            Lest a spirit should arise,
            Cold and white, to freeze your eyes,
            Some weak phantom, which your doubt
            Shapes upon the dark without
            From the dark within, a guess
            At the spirit’s deathlessness,
            Which ye entertain with fear
            In your self-built dungeon here,
            Where ye dance and shake your chain
            As if freedom would be pain,—
            Ye without a shudder meet
            In the city’s noon-day street,
            Spirits sadder and more dread
            Than from out the clay have fled :
            Spirits buried dark and deep
            In a grave where never sleep,
            The cool dew of Paradise,
            Drops upon their burning eyes,
            Buried, beyond hope of light,
            In the body’s haunted night!
            See ye not that woman pale?
            Where are bloodhounds on her trail,
            Bloodhounds two, all gaunt and lean,
            For the soul their scent is keen,
            Want and Sin, and Sin is last,
            They have followed far and fast;
            Want gave tongue, and, at her howl,
            Sin awakened with a growl.
            ’Twas the World and the World’s law
            Let them slip and cried, Hurrah!
            Ah, poor girl! she had a right
            To a blessing from the light,
            Title deeds to sky and earth
            God gave to her at her birth,
            But, before they were enjoyed,
            Poverty had made them void,
            And had drunk the sunshine up
            From all nature’s ample cup,
            Leaving her a firstborn’s share
            In the dregs of darkness there.
            Often, on the sidewalk bleak,
            Hungry, all alone, and weak.
            She has seen, in night and storm,
            Rooms o’erflow with firelight warm,
            Which, outside the window glass
            Doubled all the cold, alas !
            Till each ray that on her fell
            Stabbed her like an icicle,
            And she almost loved the wail
            Of the bloodhounds on her trail.
            Till the floor becomes her bier
            She shall feel their pantings near.
            Close upon her very heels,
            ’Spite of all the din of wheels ;
            Shivering on her pallet floor,
            She shall hear them at the door
            Whine and scratch to be let in.
            Sister bloodhounds, Want and Sin !
            Hark ! that rustle of a drew
            Stiff with lavish costliness !
            Here comes one whose cheek would flush
            But to have her garment brush
            ’Gainst the girl whose fingers thin
            Wove the weary broidery in,
            Who bent backward from her toil
            Lest her tears the silk might soil,
            And, in midnight chill and murk,
            Stitched her life into the work.
            Little doth the wearer heed
            Of the heart break in the brede,
            A hyena by her side
            Skulks, downlooking—it is Pride.
            He digs for her in the earth,
            Where lie all her claims of birth,
            With his foul paws rooting o’er
            Some long-buried ancestor
            Who, most like, a statue won
            By the ill deeds he had done.
            Round her heart and round her brain
            Wealth hath linked a golden chain,
            Which doth dose and closer press
            Heart and brain to narrowness.
            Every morn and every night
            She must bare that bosom white,
            Which so thrillingly doth rise
            ’Neath its proud embroideries,
            What its mere heave lets men know
            How much whiter 'tis than snow,—
            She must bare it, and, unseen,
            Suckle that hyena lean ;—
            Ah! the fountain’s angel shrinks,
            And forsakes it while he drinks !
            There walks Judas, he who sold
            Yesterday his Lord for gold,
            Sold God’s presence in his heart
            For a proud step in the Mart;
            He hath dealt in flesh and blood,
            At the Bank his name is good,
            At the Bank, and only there,
            ’Tis a marketable ware.
            In his eyes that stealthy gleam
            Was not learned of sky or stream,
            <a href="#p155"/>


            
            But it has the cold, hard glint,
            Of new dollars from the Mint
            Often now your spirit’s eyes
            Look through that poor clay disguise
            Which has thickened, day by day,
            Till it keeps all life away,
            And his soul in pitchy gloom
            Gropes about its narrow tomb,
            From whose dank and slimy walls,
            Drop by drop, the horror falls.
            Look ! a serpent lank and cold
            Hugs his spirit, fold on fold,
            From his heart, all day and night,
            It doth suck God’s blessed light
            Drink it will, and drink it must,
            Till the cup holds naught but dust;
            All day long he hears it hiss,
            Writhing in its fiendish bliss;
            All night long he sees its eyes
            Flicker with strange ecstasies,
            As the spirit ebbs away
            Into the absorbing day.
            Who is he that skulks afraid
            Of the trust he has betrayed,
            Shuddering if perchance a gleam
            Of old nobleness should stream
            Through the pent, unwholesome room,
            Where his shrunk soul cowers in gloom,
            Spirit sad beyond the rest
            By more instinct for the Best?
            'Tis a poet, who was sent
            For a bad world’s punishment,
            By compelling it to see
            Golden glimpses of To Be,
            By compelling it to hear
            Songs that prove the angels near;
            Who was sent to be the tongue
            Of the weak and spirit-wrung,
            Whence the fiery-winged Despair
            In men’s shrinking eyes might flare.
            ’Tis our hope doth fashion us
            To base use or glorious:
            He who might have been a lark
            Of Truth’s morning, from the dark
            Raining down melodious hope
            Of a freer, broader scope,
            Aspirations, prophecies,
            Of the spirit’s full sunrise,—
            Chose to be a bird of night,
            Which, with eyes refusing light,
            Hooted from some hollow tree
            Of the world’s idolatry.
            ’Tis his punishment to hear
            Flutterings of pinions near,
            And his own vain wings to feel
            Drooping downward to his heel,
            All their grace and import lost,
            Burthening his weary ghost:
            Ever walking by his side
            He must see his angel guide,
            Who at intervals doth turn
            Looks on him so sadly stem,
            With such ever-new surprise
            Of hushed anguish in her eyes,
            That it seems the light of day
            From around him shrinks away,
            Or drops blunted from the wall
            Built around him by his fall.
            Then the mountains, whose white peaks
            Catch the morning’s earliest streaks,
            He must see, where prophets sit,
            Turning East their faces lit,
            Whence, with footsteps beautiful,
            To the earth, yet dim and dull,
            They the gladsome tidings bring
            Of the sunlight’s hastening.
            Never can those hills of bliss
            Be o’erclimbed by feet of his!
            But enough! Oh, do not dare
            From the next its mask to tear,
            Which, although it moves about
            Like a human form without.
            Hath a soul within, I ween,
            Of the vulture’s shape and mien.

            <p>A Lecture on the Philosophy of Vegetation. Read at the Organization of
            <br/>the American Agricultural Association, at the University in the City of
            <br/>New York, on Monday, the 10th February, 1845. By W. A. Seeley, Esq.
            <br/>Wiley &amp; Putnam.</p>
            <p>Mr. Seeley’s lecture is too purely technical for popular reading, and
            <br/>we were not surprised to see, in a morning paper that gives a good por-
            <br/>tion of its columns to agricultural knowledge, some exceedingly dis-
            <br/>paraging remarks in regard to it. Probably the critic had in his mind
            <br/>Milton’s lines in Comus, 
              " How charming is divine philosophy !
              Not harsh and crabbed as vain fools suppose,
              But musical as is Apollo's lute.
              And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,’'
             was disappointed in not finding the “philosophy of vegetation” as smooth and
            flashy as a review by Macaulay. A purely scientific essay
            should not read too smoothly, lest it slip over the tongue without
            <br/>making any impression upon the mind. A few jagged points may help
            <br/>to make a principle stick to the memory. Mr. Seeley’s lecture is not
            <br/>written in the pleasing style of Dumas it is true, nor with the copious-
            <br/>ness of detail and illustration which we find in the lectures of Davy,
            <br/>but he has crowded as many facts into his lecture as we remember to
            <br/>have seen in the same space. We extract one sentence, merely to
            <br/>show how unacceptable truth itself may be made by conveying it in
            <br/>an unseemly shape ; and as a caution to those who would have their

            <p>These books have already obtained a wide popularity, and we trust

            <br/>humanity by his labors in a field which has long remained without the

            <br/>There are few besides those who suffer from gambling who know to
            <br/>what a fearful extent the vice prevails among us ; at the west, where
            <br/>society has not been put into a strait-jacket, it shows itself openly
            <br/>and fearlessly, and the mischief it produces may only be faintly im-
            <br/>agined from the bare reports of its effects, such as the extempore ex-
            <br/>ecution of half a dozen “Sportsmen” at Vicksburg a few years since
            <br/>that reach us in the newspapers. Occasionally in New York we hear
            <br/>of a defaulting clerk, or a bankrupt merchant, whose ruin has been
            <br/>produced by this dreadful vice, but the greater part of the misery and
            <br/>crime which arc caused by it are attributed to other causes. Every
            <br/>father who has a son just entering upon business should put one of
            <br/>Mr. Green’s books in his hand, and every merchant when he first re-

            <p>The Last of the Plantagenets, a Tragic Drama in three acts. By Caroline M. Keteltas.
            Founded on the romance of that name by William Heseltine of Turret house, South Lambeth,
            England. New-York, 1844.</p>
            <p>The gentle author of this " Tragic Drama” has given her book to
            <br/>the world from a very amiable motive, namely, a desire to counteract
            <br/>the prejudices which Shakspeare’s delineation of Richard the Third
            <br/>has created in the minds of mankind. But her intention is better than
            <br/>her gift. Horace Walpole labored zealously and learnedly in tho
            <br/>same cause, in his “Historic Doubts,” but Shakspeare’s Richard still
            <br/>keeps possession of men’s minds, and the world will never forgive him
            <br/>for his tyrannies, or forget that he murdered the infants in the Tower
            <br/>The blood of the innocent will always make an immortal outcry
            <br/>against those who shed it. The author of the “Tragic Drama” has
            <br/>taken a great chronological liberty with the last of the Plantagenets
            <br/>in making him kneel before the bust of Shakspeare, which we are less
            <br/>willing to forgive, since we learn from a note to her epilogue that she is
            <br/>descended from a great dramatic poet; no less than “glorious John ”
            <br/>She also informs hs that she has a relative who has a monument in
            <br/>Westminster Abbey. " A genealogical tree in the author’s family "
            <br/>she says, " traces a descent from the Poet Dryden, who married La-
            <br/>dy Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the Earl of Berkshire.” How fine
            <br/>and natural the allusion to “the Poet Dryden who married ” &amp;c.—
            <br/>Whatever doubts may be entertained of the descent from the husband
            <br/>of the daughter of the earl of Berkshire, there can be none in the
            <a href="#p156"/>
            world that the descent from the Poet Dryden to the author of the
            <br/>“Last of the Plantagenets” is not only very real, but very great.</p>

            <br/>experience, since it can be put to more uses than one; after it has en-

            <br/>may be made to warm the body by using it as a counterpane for the

            <br/>often do that would be likely to bruise the limbs if used in the way
            <br/>which we have recommended, nor any of the poppyish ones that
            <br/>would be likely to cause too deep a slumber, nor any of those gro-

            <br/>hardly know of a case in which wc could do it with a clearer con-

            <br/>tical honesty which the paper contained last Saturday, in a notice of
            <br/>our review of Bulwer’s Minor Poems published by Farmer and Dag-
            <br/>gers, and edited by C. Donald Macleod. So far from having any “pri-
            <br/>vate pique” to “gratify,” we have no private feelings of any kind, but
            <br/>pure good will, towards every person whose name is connected with
            <br/>the book, excepting Bulwer, for whom we entertain no very profound
            <br/>admiration. Mr. Macleod will acquit us of the smallest tinge of per-
            <br/>sonal unkindness towards himself, for we only know him by his wri-
            <br/>tings which have heretofore impressed us with a very high opinion of
            <br/>his abilities ; and for the publisher of the “Minor Poems," we cer-
            <br/>tainly have none but the kindest feelings. Do not, we beseech of you,

            <p>A New picture by Chapman has been exhibited at the the rooms of
            <br/>the Art Union in Broadway, the last fortnight, representing Rachel,
            <br/>mourning for her first bora, and refusing to be comforted. To our per-
            <br/>ceptions it is the best of Chapman’s paintings ; and we were pleased
            <br/>to learn that it found a private purchaser at a liberal price. When
            <br/>such works can find purchasers other artists need not despair of find-
            <br/>ing a market for their paintings. We do not allude to it for the pur-

            <br/>ence of propriety to make a public criticism on private property ; but
            <br/>to chronicle the fact of a historical painting being bought as soon as

            <br/>which struck us as the finest specimen of animal portraiture that we
            <br/>have ever seen from an American artist. The animals, though in
            <br/>high keeping, had nothing of that unnatural glossiness of hide which
            <br/>is so disagreeable in the majority of pictures of this class. The inte-
            <br/>rior of the stable would do credit to any American artist with whose
            <br/>works we are acquainted. Mr. Hicks adheres to the integrity of na-
            <br/>ture in his portraits, and we should judge from the few pictures of his
            <br/>execution that we have seen that he is a hard student and a close ob-
            <br/>server of nature. If he do not in a few years stand at the head of his

            <p>Mons. Edouart’s Silhouettes —The works of this gentleman de-

            <br/>a different idea of his genius from what we had found before we saw

        <p>The New York Philharmonic Society.—The third Concert of
          <br/>the third season took place at the Apollo Saloon on Saturday, March
          <br/>1st, when, as usual, there was a perfect crowd, an intolerable heat,
          <br/>and no ventilation. Since the room has been hung with the bar-room
          <br/>drapery, it seems impossible to breathe with freedom or comfort; add-

          <br/>in the worst possible taste. We should be glad to see the room as it
          <br/>was.</p>
        <p>The programme was as follows:</p>
        <div class="ab">Part I.

          <br/> Director, Mr. Louis Wiegers.</div>
        <p>The symphony Eroica, of Beethoven, is so well known to all who
          <br/>visit these classical Concerts, that a particular description will not be
          <br/>necessary. The design is said to have been conceived in honor of Na-
          <br/>poleon, when first Consul, but before it was completed, the first Consul
          <br/>bad become Emperor, and Beethoven in the deepest indignation vowed
          <br/>that he would never dedicate one of his works to such a renegade from
          <br/>his principles. The first movement is supposed to vindicate the indo-
          <br/>mitable firmness of the conqueror’s mind ; the second movement is a
          <br/>dead march ; the third, the. return from the funeral, and the fourth, a
          <br/>sort of musical history of the times, being a collection of revolutionary
          <br/>airs, worked one into the other.</p>
        <a href="#p157"/>


        
        <p>Of the performance of this great work, we can with justice say that
          <br/>it was executed with great precision; each point was taken up with
          <br/>perfect exactness, and grand effects were frequently produced ; but to
          <br/>us the performance appeared hard and mechanical. The conductor
          <br/>never deviated from the exact time at which he started—on, on, on!
          <br/>without pause, without breath—firm, unyielding, and untiring in its
          <br/>motion, his hand seemed a sort of human Metomone that was wound
          <br/>up to go, just so. Too strict attention to mere time, may produce cor-
          <br/>rectness in performance, but something more is wanted to delineate
          <br/>faithfully the mind of the composer. We believe that Mr. Weigers
          <br/>will make an able conductor, but on this occasion he has attended less
          <br/>to the intellect than to the mechanism of the art.</p>
        <p>Madame Arnoult sang one of Donizetti’s mawkish arias, which coming directly after
          Beethoven, was as grateful to the ear as tepid water to the palate after a draught of
          Burgundy.</p>
        <p>We cannot refrain from asking of the Board of Government why such
          <br/>an incongruous mixture of style is allowed to appear at such a concert.
          <br/>We have asked this question repeatedly before, and have at various
          <br/>times received assurances that there would be a change for the better.
          <br/>We placed but little faith in such assurances, but even that little was
          <br/>thrown away ; for it seems that for the mere chance of catching a few
          <br/>dollars in extra tickets from some of the "upper ten thousand,” they
          <br/>would insert anything in their programme. After the comparative
          <br/>failure of Castellan, and the positive and unmistakeable failures of
          <br/>Valtellina and Signora Amalia Ricci, we did think that the " Govern-
          <br/>ment” would learn wisdom, and have done with the Donizettis, Mar-
          <br/>lianis, Riccis, and a host of other i’s. But experience is never con-
          <br/>sidered of importance until it is bought dearly.</p>
        <p>Madame Arnoult executes most of her passages with exceeding deli-
          <br/>cacy and precision ; her voice, however, is weak and incapable of pro-
          <br/>ducing any great effect. Her style is so evidently that of an amateur,
          <br/>that we fear a long time must elapse before she can do herself credit
          <br/>before the public.</p>
        <p>The Instrumental Quintett was a truly admirable performance, in
          <br/>every way worthy of its intrinsic beauty. We have really no choice
          <br/>among those admirable artists, Messrs. Kyle, Weisse, Grœneveldt,
          <br/>Trosji and Reiff. We were kept in a continual round of admiration
          <br/>from its commencement to its close, and we can only say now, that so
          <br/>perfect an instrumental performance was never before heard in this
          <br/>country. The second part commenced with Sterndale Bennett’s descriptive
          <br/>overture of the Naiads. It is a remarkable composition in every re-
          <br/>spect. Its conception indicates a fancy at once brilliantly imaginative
          <br/>and highly refined, and the instrumentation displays an intimate know-
          <br/>ledge and familiar acquaintance with the particular genius of the dif-
          <br/>ferent instruments. Bennett was a pupil of Mendelssohn, and his com-
          <br/>positions bear somewhat of the impress of that great master’s mind.
          <br/>We do not by any means assert that Stemdale Bennett is a coyist,
          <br/>but all his works have a tinge of the intellectual beauty which is the
          <br/>characteristic of the writings of Mendelssohn. In his instrumentation
          <br/>this similarity is singularly striking; he treats passages as Mendels-
          <br/>sohn would have treated them; many of his combinations smack of
          <br/>bis great model, but his conception is his own, and one of more singu-
          <br/>lar and attractive beauty we have rarely heard. Its reputation in Eu-
          <br/>rope is second only to the Midsummer Night’s Dream and Fingal’s Cave.
          <br/>We were by no means pleased with the performance of this work, for
          <br/>it was exceedingly unequal. Some passages were given with great
          <br/>delicacy, while others were crowded and indistinct. Another rehearsal
          <br/>or two would have made both the conductor and the band more fami-
          <br/>liar with the intention of the composer, and also more at ease with
          <br/>each other.</p>
        <p>Madame Arnoult sang a portion of a scena from les Huguenots, by
          <br/>Meyerbeer, we regret to say very badly indeed. Not only was she
          <br/>continually out of tune to a painful degree, but she failed in several
          <br/>Passages, particularly two chromatic passages, which were very bad
          <br/>in taste, but still worse in execution. With every wish to be lenient
          <br/>to one who has so recently adopted the profession, we are yet compell-
          <br/>ed to speak the truth of all alike.</p>
        <p>The instrumental Dialogo for flute and clarionette, was played in
          <br/>most exquisite style by Messrs Kyle and Grœneveldt. Mr. Kyle play-
          <br/>ed with more brilliancy, precision and feeling than upon any former
          <br/>“cession within our remembrance. He only requires emulation to ren-
          <br/>der him always equal to that evening’s performance. He has certainly
          <br/>few rivals, and no superiors in this country, but he lacks somewhat of
          <br/>the true artistic enthusiasm which will lead one always to endeavor
          <br/>to excel himself. Mr. Grœneveldt’s solo was spoiled by the band, and
          <br/>he showed them their fault with an emphasis that must have astonish-
          <br/>ed them, and which they are not likely toon to forget.</p>


        
        <p>The concluding overture by Ries, is a brilliant and effective compo-
          <br/>sition, and had it not been so late would doubtless have been encored.
          <br/>It was admirably performed ; the wind instruments, as usual, distin-
          <br/>guished themselves greatly.</p>
        <p>We consider Mr. Weiger’s debut as a Philharmonic conductor highly
          <br/>successful. It is true that we cannot award all praise, but what we do
          <br/>say we say most cordially, and with infinite satisfaction we congratu-
          <br/>late him upon his highly creditable wielding of the baton.</p>
        <p>The next concert will take place on the 15th of April.</p>

            <p>“Twelve Nouvelles Vocalisées, pour Mezzo-Soprano, dediées á
            <br/>S. A. R. Madame La Duchesse de Nemours, par Marco Bordogni.”_____
            <br/>In two books.</p>
            <p>“Abd-El-Kader Quick Step,” for the piano forte, composed bv J
            <br/>C. Viereck.</p>
            <p>“The Reproach” (Il Rimprovero), duettino, words translated from
            <br/>Metastasio, by B. S. Barclay. The music by F. Flovino.
            <br/>“Le Tremolo, sur un Theme de Bethoven, pour le Piano Forte,
            <br/>composée par Henri Herz.”</p>
            <p>Marco Bordogni has for many years been considered universally
            <br/>one of the finest singing masters in the world. He numbers among his
            <br/>pupils many of the most distinguished artists of the French capital.
            <br/>His consummate skill has gained for him the professorship of singing
            <br/>at the Paris Conservatoire, and also the honorable distinction of Cheva-
            <br/>lier de I’Ordre Royal de la Legion d’Honneur. Every work from his
            <br/>pen must be looked upon as a vocal standard and as a gift of price for
            <br/>futurity. The one before us is intended for the use of those who pos-
            <br/>sess a mezzo soprano quality of voice. On looking through the books
            <br/>it will be perceived that a very extensive range is given to this voice
            <br/>a scale of two octaves and a note, from A below to B above. Many
            <br/>of our so-called soprano voices do not possess such a compass. The
            <br/>exercises are not for beginners ; they are intended to follow, after
            <br/>the usual routine of preliminary practice has been gone through. They
            <br/>are initiated to form the style, to render the ear firm under the most
            <br/>rapid and delicate changes of key; to impart emphasis and expression .
            <br/>to perfect the use of the shake, the sforzaudo, the vibrato; to cultivate
            <br/>the portamento, but to denude it of its abuses by imparting to it dig
            <br/>nity, emphasis and passion.</p>
            <p>The twelve exercises display several styles, of which we shall dis-
            <br/>course in order. No. 1 is a very beautiful larghetto movement in C.»
            <br/>semibreve time. The passages are mostly to be sung legato, with
            <br/>many parts of marked emphasis. The key changes to its dominant
            <br/>and to E flat. The latter change is direct, and requires much steadiness
            <br/>of ear, particularly as it returns to the original key. No. 2 is a some
            <br/>what pastoral movement in A flat, twelve-eight time. The second part
            <br/>of this is in D flat changing to F minor and ending in E flat, from which
            <br/>it returns to the original. This is a fine exercise both for the ear and
            <br/>for the time. No. 3 is a larghetto movement in B minor, six-eight
            <br/>time. This is also calculated to give great delicacy to the ear, for the
            <br/>harmonies are always changing. The intervals are often great, and
            <br/>always difficult, requiring the utmost precision to render them justly
            <br/>No. 4 is an elegant andante in A flat two-four time, changing to an al-
            <br/>legro, followed by allegro A tempmeno. This is a very difficult, bril-
            <br/>liant, and instructive exercise, partaking of every quality of the grand
            <br/>scena excepting the recitation. No. 5 is an allegro spiritoso in G, semi-
            <br/>breve time. The movement is almost entirely in triplets, and the con-
            <br/>cluding cadence is one of great difficulty, requiring the finest ear and
            <br/>most delicate intonation to execute it, being a triplet passage in semi-
            <br/>tones, for an octave and a half. No. 6 is an allegro moderato in G
            <br/>common time, of a bold character, containing many passages of diffi-
            <br/>culty ; tied notes, syncopations, extended intervals, &amp;c., &amp;c.
            Such is
            <br/>a description of the first book; and we are sure that the pupil who shall
            <br/>have the perseverance to achieve its contents, will be marvellously
            <br/>improved in intonation, execution and style, and other difficulties
            <br/>which occur in music.</p>
            <p>Abd-el-Kader Quick Step in B flat two-four time. The first movement
            <br/>is brisk and martial, but like ten thousand other marches. In the first
            <br/>bar of the fifth line, the second note in the bass should be E natural.
            <br/>The trio is in E flat, and quite devoid of originality, but still the piece
            <br/>is an inoffensive composition, and likely from its facility of execution,
            <br/>to meet with a ready sale. It has a clever vignette title-page, repre-
            <br/>senting the beau ideal of an Arab chief.</p>
            <p>The Reproach.—Duettino. In F minor, common time. It is an agi-
            <br/>tato movement, full of passionate energy, and breathing the heart’s
            <br/>despair in every phrase. The syncophated passage at ‘‘My Heart beats
            <br/>not for thee," is very effective, and the introduction to its relative ma-
            <br/>jor, is exceedingly happy. The subject is afterwards repeated in F
            <br/>major, and is carried on to the end in perfect unity of design. It is a
            <a href="#p158"/>
            very clever composition, and although the accompaniment is here and
            <br/>there somewhat heavy and labored, it is as a whole a very musician-
            <br/>like work, and one which we can very cordially recommend to the
            <br/>public.</p>
            <p>There are a few corrections necessary in a revised edition. The
            <br/>seventh note, in fourth bar, third line of accompaniment, should be E
            <br/>flat; third bar, third line, in page four, the D in the right hand should
            <br/>be E flat. The word or is omitted from the second voice part, bar oue,
            <br/>third line, page five. In the first bar of the last symphony the B in
            <br/>the right hand should be C.</p>

            <p>Bertini’s Great Method tor the Piano-Forte.—Every teach-
            <br/>er of every grade in the profession, has felt for years the want of a
            <br/>Piano-Forte instruction bonk, which should contain in its single com-
            <br/>pass matter sufficient for many months' consideration and practice;—
            <br/>beginning at the beginning, and leading the pupil on by easy stages
            <br/>pretty far into the mystery—preserving at the same time a strict and
            <br/>pure school. This end has been obtained by Bertini, as far as we can
            <br/>judge, from a somewhat hasty glance at its contents. Next week we
            <br/>shall present our readers with a review of the whole work as published
            <br/>by E. H. Wade and W.H. Oakes, 197 Washington street, Boston.
            <br/>Meanwhile let the author speak for himself.</p>
            <p>“My intention in publishing this new method, has been to facilitate
            <br/>the study of the Piano-Forte; snd I have tried as much as is in my
            <br/>power to furnish a progressive work, in which the young pianists
            <br/>might, asssisted by the experience of their master, find all the elements
            <br/>of instruction. </p>
            <p>“A great number of elementary works—many of them written, too,
            <br/>by men of talent and very good sense in some respects—have the dis-
            <br/>advantage that they are rather a collection of popular airs, than a se-
            <br/>ries of lessons connected and graduated so as to develope the musical
            <br/>knowledge and mechanism of beginners. I wanted to avoid this fault,
            <br/>and have, therefore, written especially for this work a scries of melo-
            <br/>dies and exercises, instead of resorting to popular melodies, romances,
            <br/>waltzes, &amp;c., &amp;c., which are commonly annexed to instruction books.</p>
            <p>“It has hitherto but loo often been forgotten, that an instruction
            <br/>book is intended for a grammar, and not merely for a book of amuse-
            <br/>ment ; and hence the false system which made elementary works con-
            <br/>sist entirely of little airs which the memory can easily retain. This
            <br/>custom perverts the taste of the pupil; it prevents their mind and ear
            <br/>from making themselves familiar with the different harmonic combi-
            <br/>nations, and it fills their heads with musical trivialities, which more
            <br/>and more drawing them away from the works of true art, ultimately
            <br/>incapacitate them from understanding the works of great masters.</p>
            <p>“It is very important to have the first studies of children directed
            <br/>by a skilful master; for, on the principles imbibed in the first lessons
            <br/>always depends the future success of an artist;—faults then acquired
            <br/>and confirmed by long practice, will never be lost.</p>
            <p>“I would therefore make it the duty of parents, and those who have
            <br/>the charge of pupils, to act, in this respect, with circumspection, and
            <br/>to consult artists before concluding about the choice of a teacher.</p>
            <p>“I hope I have succeeded in composing a solid work, which will
            <br/>force the pupil to exert himself, and familiarise him with all the diffi-
            <br/>culties of tonalite, lingering and rhythm.</p>
            <p>“I have graduated all my lessons from the natural key up to those
            <br/>most charged with chromatic signs. I have often observed,in pupils
            <br/>who had already obtained a certain proficiency, a difficulty in reading
            <br/>music with accidentals; and I doubt not this want of readiness is to
            <br/>be ascribed to the timidity and excessive reserve of the old instruction
            <br/>books.</p>
            <p>“My course of piano-forte instruction, if followed from the begin-
            <br/>ning to the end, will offer one advantage, which I hope will be appre-
            <br/>ciated. It furnishes elements of study for more than a year, without
            <br/>making it necessary to have recourse to a multitude of little pieces,
            <br/>almost all of them carelessly written and badly fingered.</p>

            <p>To Accordion Players.—We call the attention of professional and
            <br/>amateur performers on this instrument, to the admirable improve-
            <br/>ments made upon it by Mr. Dumsday, Professor of Music, 55 Christie
            <br/>street. This instrument has hitherto been considered very imperfect
            <br/>from the want of the harmonies necessary to enable the performer to
            <br/>modulate into various keys—even the simplest melody could only be
            <br/>accompanied by the tonic and the dominant. Hut Mr. Dumsday’s in-
            <br/>vention, by applying keys to the bottom of the instrument, entirely
            <br/>remedies this delect and supplies chords sufficient for every ordinary
            <br/>purpose. Mr. Dumsday can apply this addition to any accordion
            <br/>which has the chronometer scale at a reasonable rate. The import-
            <br/>ance of this invention will be at once appreciated by every one ac-
            <br/>quainted with the instrument, and we cordially recommend all who
            <br/>are learning it, or wish to learn it, to call on Mr. Dumsday, who will
            <br/>give practical evidence of the superior advantages of this invention
            <br/>over all others now in use.</p>

          <br/>ly in circulation here, succeeded in securing the American Theatre in

        <p>The Swiss Bell Ringers have surprised the people into an extensive
          <br/>enthusiasm. They are very highly spoken of.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barton, the flutist, arrived here lately; he had a very narrow
          <br/>escape from shipwreck, and report says, that to his presence of mind
          <br/>and hearty assistance, the captain acknowledges the safe arrival of
          <br/>the vessel to be mainly attributed.</p>
        <p>THE MISSES SLOMAN attracted a large audience at the Phil-
          <br/>harmonic concert, Philadelphia, last week. These very talented
          <br/>young ladies will ere long reap a rich harvest, to which their talents
          <br/>and perseverance fully entitle them.</p>
        <p>HOME NEWS.—The Park Theatre will open on the 10th
          <br/>inst. As far as we can learn, the business will begin with Booth, and
          <br/>Anderson and the Seguins will follow in succession.</p>
        <p>Why does not Simpson start with a dash, by bringing out Antigone,
          <br/>the tragedy by Sophocles, with Mendelssohn’s music? It would create
          <br/>a great sensation.</p>
        <p>They talk of building an Opera-house up town !! We maintain that
          <br/>this is news, for many people will naturally believe that after so much
          <br/>talk, something is doing. But we inform them, that they talk.</p>
        <p>Mr. George Loder has been very sick, but is fast recovering.</p>
        <p>Mr. W. A. King has left Grace Church, and taken the organist’s sit-
          <br/>uation at St. Peter’s Church, in Barclay street. This is a great loss
          <br/>to the one, and a great gain to the other.</p>
        <p>Miss Watson is, we understand, to be the first Soprano in St. Pe-

        <p>It is rumored that Mr. Beams will succeed Mr. King at Grace Church.</p>
        <p>Mitchell will produce next week, a new burlesque upon a popular
          <br/>Opera. It will, we hear, be admirably produced.</p>
        <p>A correspondent requests us to offer ten cents reward to any body
          <br/>who will give any good public reason why Mr. Brough should nave a
          <br/>complimentary benefit? The gentleman has retired from the profes-
          <br/>sion, and has become a merchant. “How then,” writes our corres-
          <br/>pondent, “do you account for Mr. Brongh, while denying his profes-
          <br/>sion, receiving any paltry engagement which may offer here, besides
          <br/>flying round to all the small towns and giving small concerts. If Mr.
          <br/>Brough is a musician, let him acknowledge it, and not deny a profes-
          <br/>sion which is an honor to any man who understands it; but if Mr. B.
          <br/>is not in the profession, let him cease from thrusting himself into en-
          <br/>gagements, to the injury of those who arc compelled to live upon their
          <br/>professional talents.” A friend at our elbow suggests that the compli-
          <br/>mentary concert is given as a public and private tribute to his good
          <br/>taste in retiring from the profession. If our correspondent is satisfied
          <br/>with the guess, we shall be glad to hand from him to our highly talented
          <br/>friend, those ten cents.</p>
        <p>We invite our readers to go this evening to the concert of the Ger-
          <br/>man Benevolent Society, at the Tabernacle, and are sure of redeeming
          <br/>our word in promising them a delightful treat. We seldom have seen
          <br/>a programme richer or happier in its choice. Beethoven, Weber,
          <br/>Mendelssohn, by the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society, Pico,
          <br/>Grœnfeld, Scharfenberg, and several other eminent artists, will make
          <br/>the honors. But the most interesting feature, from its novelty and in-
          <br/>trinsic merit, will undoubtedly be the Song-Union, composed of our
          <br/>principal German citizens, who have volunteered their services, owing
          <br/>to the charitable purposes of the concert. For the introduction of the
          <br/>German Manner Chor in America, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Pera-
          <br/>beau, whose principal object in leaving an enviable position in Germa-
          <br/>ny, was to attain this object, and we do not doubt in the least of the
          <br/>success of his undertaking, as he possesses in an eminent degree, both
          <br/>the qualities of the leader and of the professor.</p>

            <br/>The following case, in the opinion of many of your subscribers,
            <br/>loudly calls for some censor’s correcting rod.</p>
            <p>There is in this city a certain young gentleman, who has this winter,
            <br/>for the first lime, been introduced to society; or as Seneca would have
            <br/>it, “has left the society of boys to enjoy that of philosophers;" or as
            <br/>an anxious mamma would say of her bud of ‘ sweet sixteen,’ “just been
            <br/>brought out.” He is a young man of fine talents, of good appearance,
            <br/>of an easy, agreeable, and manly address, and is very learned for one
            <br/>no older; in short, he is a gentleman, and particularly distinguished
            <br/>for a straight-forward, independent manner of expressing hit opinions.
            <br/>He has been before the town only seven weeks, and yet no man’s
            <br/>society was ever more eagerly courted than his, from the half-starved
            <br/>author shivering in his fifth-story garret, to the rosy-nosed publisher,
            <br/>who, by “turning to commodify” the brains of these same starving
            <br/>authors, is enabled to enjoy a luxuriously furnished mansion, and
            <br/>“fare sumptuously every day.”</p>
            <p>But with all my friend’s good and shilling qualities, he has one bad
            <br/>failing, that I fear will cause him to fall in the estimation of very
            <br/>many of his best friends ;—by friends I do not mean associates who
            <br/>eat his meat and drink his wine, but those, who admiring his many
            <br/>good qualities, wish well of him, and ever speak well of him be-
            <br/>hind his back. His failing is this:--he has become so indoctrinated
            <br/>with opposition to Texas, that whenever he hears the most distant
            <br/>allusion to the subject, or any thing else that by association of ideas,
            <br/>brings it to mind, he seizes the opportunity to let the company know
            <br/>that he is opposed to the measure. No matter what the company, or
            <br/>occasion, or place, if he but hear an allusion to Texas, he must, uncle
            <br/>Toby-like, mount his ever-saddled nag, and frisk away for the enter-
            <a href="#p159"/>
               <br/>
            tainment of his auditory, though all the laugh I ever saw him raise
            <br/>was at him. He takes vast delight in exhibiting this beast of his.
            <br/>although to my mind he is one of the most hideously deformed
            <br/>animals imaginable.</p>
            <p>Last Saturday when he made his seventh appearance in public,
            <br/>while conversing upon a subject having no connexion with annexation,
            <br/>he took occasion to beak on in the middle of a sentence, and abruptly
            <br/>tell the company, many of whom were his elders, and far his superiors
            <br/>in information and talents, and withal many of them warm friends of
            <br/>the measure," that the people declare themselves opposed to the mea-
            <br/>sure,’’ and that “he discerns a glimpse of morning breaking out from
            <br/>the darkness,” for the joint resolution will not pass both houses.” A
            <br/>few minutes afterwards, when the company were considering the
            <br/>literary merits of a young man, who had at some former time said
            <br/>something in favor of Texas, he volunteered to tell us—though we
            <br/>were not discussing the merits or demerits of annexation, but, as said
            <br/>before, speaking of a young man who had sometime, to somebody,
            <br/>said something in its favor—“that the measure savored as little of
            <br/>justice as any that could be proposed.”</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. Editor, I do not find fault with his opinions, nor for ex-
            <br/>pressing them at proper times and places; but would it not look better
            <br/>of him to let off his extra steam in a political meeting, and give vent
            <br/>to his spleen through the columns of some political journal? I pray
            <br/>you, my dear sir, to ask him, when he attends a literary meeting, or
            <br/>philosophical disquisition, or convivial party, or any mixed company,
            <br/>to have sufficient common civility to keep his politics at home. Many
            <br/>who are exceedingly fond of his company will feel themselves com-
            <br/>pelled to forego that pleasure if he always carries in his pocket, and
            <br/>at every opportunity offensively thrusts under their noses, a phial of
            <br/>this unsavory partizan stuff. I pray you, Mr. Editor, take your pen
            <br/>from behind your ear, and shake it at this friend of mine, ana thereby
            <br/>perhaps make others flutter who are in a similar predicament.</p>
            <br/>

          <p>Mr. Webster and his Friends.—There have been a vari-
            <br/>ety of statements in the newspapers the past month or two, respecting
            <br/>a magnificent donation said to have been made to Daniel Webster, to
            <br/>induce him to return to the Senate. The facts are ; that certain gen-
            <br/>tlemen, feeling that the welfare of the country demanded his pre-
            <br/>sence in the Senate, and knowing that his private affairs were not in
            <br/>a condition which would admit of his return to public life, without ma-
            <br/>king a greater sacrifice than his duty to his family would permit, open-
            <br/>ed a subscription, among a very limited number of course, with the
            <br/>object of raising a hundred thousand dollars, to be invested for his
            <br/>benefit. About sixty thousand dollars were subscribed in Boston, and
            <br/>the remainder in New York. This has been, or will be invested so as
            <br/>to produce seven per cent. The income to be given to Mr. Webster
            <br/>during his life, and continued to Mrs. Webster during hers, after which
            <br/>the principal is to revert to the original donors, or their heirs.
            <br/>We believe this to be a tribute to genius, without a parallel, in the
            <br/>history of our own or any other country. It matters not what the ob-
            <br/>ject of the donors may be. As an acknowledgment of the greatness
            <br/>of the recipient, it is alike unequivocal and honorable to him, whether
            <br/>their motives be mercenary or patriotic. For our own part, we think
            <br/>that the transaction reflects the highest honor on all parties concerned,
            <br/>and we wish we had more such men, who could command such friends
            <br/>we should not care a straw what principles they professed.</p>
        </div>
  
      <div id="#p28" class="piece">
        <p>In a late lecture on the "Poets and Poetry of America,” delivered
          <br/>before an audience made up chiefly of editors and their connexions, I
          <br/>took occasion to speak what I know to be the truth, and I endeavour-
          <br/>ed so to speak it that there should be no chance of misunderstanding
          <br/>what it was I intended to say. I told these gentlemen to their
          <br/>teeth that, with a very few noble exceptions, they had been engaged
          <br/>for many years in a system of indiscriminate laudation of American
          <br/>books—a system which, more than any other one thing in the
          <br/>world, had tended to the depression of that American Literature”
          <br/>whose elevation it was designed to effect. I said this, and very much
          <br/>more of a similar tendency, with as thorough a distinctness as I could
          <br/>command. Could I, at the moment, have invented any terms more
          <br/>explicit, wherewith to express my contempt of our general editorial
          <br/>course of corruption and puffery, I should have employed them beyond
          <br/>the shadow of a doubt;—aud should I think of anything more expres-
          <br/>sive hereafter, I will endeavour either to find or to make an opportunity
          <br/>for its introduction to the public.</p>
        <p>And what, for all this, had I to anticipate? In a very few cases, the
          <br/>open, and, in several, the silent approval of the more chivalrous por-
          <br/>tion of the press ;—but in a majority of instances, I should have been
          <br/>weak indeed to look for anything but abuse. To the Willises—the
          <br/>O’Sullivans—the Duyckincks—to the choice and magnanimous few
          <br/>who spoke promptly in my praise, and who have since taken my hand
          <br/>with a more cordial and more impressive grasp than ever—to these I
          <br/>return, of course, my acknowledgements, for that they have rendered
          <br/>me my due. To my villifiers I return also such thanks as they de-
          <br/>serve, inasmuch as without what they have done me the honor to say,
          <br/>there would have been much of point wanting in the compliments of
          <br/>my friends. Had I, indeed, from the former, received any less equiv-
          <br/>ocal tokens of disapprobation, I should at this moment have been look-
          <br/>ing about me to discover what sad blunder I had committed.</p>
        <p>I am most sincere in what I say. I thank these, my opponents, for
          <br/>their good will,—manifested, of course, after their own fashion. No
          <br/>doubt they mean me well—if they could only he brought to believe it;
          <br/>and I shall expect more reasonable things from them hereafter. In the
          <br/>mean time, I await patiently the period when they shall have fairly
          <br/>made an end of what they have to say—when they shall have sufficient-
          <br/>ly exalted themselves in their own opinion—and when, especially, they
          <br/>shall have brought me over to that precise view of the question which
          <br/>it is their endeavor to have me adopt.</p>

            <p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
            <br/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
            <br/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
            <br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and
            studies, are
            <br/>given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
            <br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
            <br/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
            <br/>haa arrived when a superficial know ledge of the Piano is of but little account,
            <br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will been
            <br/>abled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-
            <br/>cians.</p>
            <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
            <br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
            lesson
            <br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p>
            <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
            <br/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s
            Method
            <br/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
            <br/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the

            disposes

            <p>A collection of 150,000 likenesses with autographs api ended, preserved in

            <p>Goldsmith’s Gems or Pennmanship.—The Chirographic art is
            <br/>much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, and
            <br/>Mr. Goldsmith may well claim to be considered at its head. The
            <br/>volume before us exhibits more taste and ingenuity, and higher proofs
            <br/>of manual dexterity than we have ever seen before.</p>

        <div class="ab">To be Published every Saturday.</div>
        <p>The Broadway Journal will differ from any of the weekly Peri-
          <br/>odicals now published in this city, as it will be made up entirely ot
          <br/>original matter, consisting of Essays, Criticisms on Art and Literature,
          <br/>Domestic and Foreign Correspondence, and Literary and Scientific
          <br/>Intelligence.</p>
        <p>Illustrations will be given as often as good original Designs can
          <br/>be procured, and drawings and plans of all new public buildings that
          <br/>have either elegance or novelty to recommend them to notice. Par-
          <br/>ticular attention will be given to this department, and no pains spared
          <br/>to make it worthy of patronage.</p>
        <p>Efficient aid has already been secured in the services of some of the
          <br/>best writers in the country i but it is hoped that a free channel be-
          <br/>ing opened through which true-hearted men may “let loose their
          <br/>thoughts,” will be the means of drawing out some of the slumbering
          <br/>talent amongst us which has not yet been seen afloat on the surface of
          <br/>our periodical literature.</p>
        <p>The Broadway Journal will espouse the cause of no political par-
          <br/>ty, but will hold itself free to condemn or approve any men or meas-
          <br/>ures, that a patriotic regard for the welfare of the country may dictate.
          <br/>It will be printed on tine paper with clear type, in the Octavo form of
          <br/>16 pages, double columns.</p>
        <p>Terms $3,00 per annum—Single numbers 6 1-4 cts.</p>
