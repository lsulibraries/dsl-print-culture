         <p>To the Public.—The suspension of “The Broadway
<br/>Journal" for one week, has been occasioned by the necessity
<br/>fofr some arrangements in which the public have no interest,
<br/>but which, beyond doubt, will give increased value and
<br/>efficiency to the paper.</p>
         <p>In commencing the Second Volume, the undersigned begs
<br/>leave to return his sincere thanks to the numerous friends 
<br/>who have lent him their aid in the very difficult task of
<br/>establishing a literary and critical weekly. The success of
<br/>the work, in the brief period of its existence, has been, he
<br/>truly believes, beyond precedent—and from a briliiant Past,
<br/>he looks confidently to a triumphant Future.</p>
         <p>The editorial conduct of “ The Broadway Journal” is un-
<br/>der the sole charge of Edgar A. Poe—Mr. H. C. Watson,
<br/>as heretofore, controlling the Musical Department.</p>

         <div class="head">The Masque of the Red Death.</div>
         <p>The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No
<br/>pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was
<br/>its Avator and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood.
<br/>There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then pro-
<br/>fuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet
<br/>stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the vic-
<br/>tim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and
<br/>from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seiz- 
<br/>ure, progress and termination of the disease, were the inci- 
<br/>dents of half an hour.</p>
         <p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sa- 
<br/>gacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he
<br/>summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted
<br/>friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and 
<br/>with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castel-
<br/>lated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent struc- 
<br/>ture, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august
<br/>taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had
<br/>gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought fur-
<br/>naces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They re-
<br/>solved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sud-
<br/>den impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey
<br/>was amply provisioned. With such precautions the cour-
<br/>tiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world
<br/>could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to
<br/>grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appli-
<br/>ances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were impro-
<br/>visatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians,
<br/>there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security
<br/>were within. Without was the “ Red Death.”</p>
         <p>It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his
<br/>seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously 
<br/>abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.
</p>
         <p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let
<br/>me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were
<br/>seven—an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such
<br/>suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors
<br/>slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the
<br/>view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the
<br/>case was very different; as might have been expected from
<br/>the duke’s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so ir-
<br/>regularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more
<br/>than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twen-
<br/>ty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the
<br/>right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow
<br/>Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pur-
<br/>sued the windings of the suite. These windows were of
<br/>stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the pre-
<br/>vailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it
<br/>opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for exam-
<br/>ample, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The
<br/>second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries,
<br/>and here the panes were purple. The third was green
<br/>throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was
<br/>furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the
<br/>sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely
<br/>shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the
<br/>ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a
<br/>carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber
<br/>only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
<br/>decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood
<br/>color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there
<br/>any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden or-
<br/>naments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the
<br/>roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp
<br/>or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors
<br/>that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window,
<br/>a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its
<br/>rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the
<br/>room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and
<br/>fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber
<br/>the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hang-
<br/>ings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the ex-
<br/>treme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances
<br/>of those who entered, that there were few of the company
<br/>bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>
         <p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the
<br/>western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum
<br/>swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang;
<br/>and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and
<br/>the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen
<br/>lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep
<br/>and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and em-
<br/>phasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the
<br/>orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their
<br/>performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page18"/>
perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief dis-
<br/>concert of the whole gay company ; and, while the chimes
<br/>of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew
<br/>pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over
<br/>their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when
<br/>the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervad-
<br/>ed the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and
<br/>smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made
<br/>whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming
<br/>of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and
<br/>then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three
<br/>thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,)
<br/>there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were
<br/>the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as be-
<br/>fore.</p>
         <p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent
<br/>revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine
<br/>eye for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere
<br/>fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions
<br/>glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would
<br/>have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.
<br/>It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure
<br/>that he was not.</p>
         <p>He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellish-
<br/>ments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great
<br/>fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given
<br/>character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque.
<br/>There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phan-
<br/>tasm—much of what has been since seen in “ Hernani.’
<br/>There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and ap-
<br/>pointments. There were delirious fancies such as the mad-
<br/>man fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of
<br/>the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible,
<br/>and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To
<br/>and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multi-
<br/>tude of dreams. And these—the dreams—writhed in and
<br/>about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild mu-
<br/>sic of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And,
<br/>anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall
<br/>of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all
<br/>is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-
<br/>frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away
<br/>—they have endured but an instant—and a light, half-sub-
<br/>dued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now
<br/>again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to
<br/>and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many
<br/>tinted windows through which stream the rays from the
<br/>tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of
<br/>the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture:
<br/>for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light
<br/>through the blood-colored panes ; and the blackness of the
<br/>sable drapery appals ; and to him whose foot falls upon the
<br/>sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a
<br/>muffled peal more solemly emphatic than any which reaches
<br/>their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the oth-
<br/>er apartments.</p>
         <p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in
<br/>them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went
<br/>whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding
<br/>of midnight upou the clock. And then the music ceased, as
<br/>I have told ; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted ;
<br/>and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.
<br/>But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell
<br/>of the clock ; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of
<br/>thought crept, with more of lime, into the meditations of
  <br/>the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus, too, it <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last
<br/> chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many indi-
<br/> viduals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware
<br/> of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the
<br/>attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of
<br/>this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around,
<br/> there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or
<br/> murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then,
<br/>finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>
         <p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it
<br/>may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could
<br/>have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade li-
<br/>cense of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in
<br/>question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds
<br/>of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in
<br/>the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched with-
<br/>out emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and
<br/>death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest con
<br/>be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply
<br/>to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither
<br/>wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt,
<br/>and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the
<br/>grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so
<br/>nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that
<br/>the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting
<br/>the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not
<br/>approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer
<br/>had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.
<br/>His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with
<br/>all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet
<br/>horror.</p>
         <p>When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral
<br/>image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more
<br/>fully to sustain its role, stalkod to and fro among the waltz-
<br/>ers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a
<br/>strong shudder either of terror or distaste ; but, in the next,
<br/>his brow reddened with rage.</p>
         <p>“ Who dares ?" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers
<br/>who stood near him—“ who dares insult us with this blas-
<br/>phemous mockery ? Seize him and unmask him—that we
<br/>may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the bat-
<br/>tlements !”</p>
         <p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the
<br/>Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang
<br/>throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly—for the
<br/>prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had be-
<br/>come hushed at the waving of his hand.</p>
         <p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a
<br/>group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke,
<br/>there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the di-
<br/>rection of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at
<br/>hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made clo-
<br/> ser approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless
<br/>awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had</p>
         <p>inspired the whole party, there were found none who put
<br/>forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed
<br/>within a yard of the prince’s person ; and, while the vast as-
<br/>sembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of
<br/>the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but
<br/>with the same solemn and measured step which had distin-
<br/>guished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the
<br/>purple—through the purple to the green—through the green
<br/>to the orange—through this again to the white—and even
<br/>thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made
<br/>to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Pros-
<br/>pero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own mo-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page19"/>
mentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six cham-
<br/>bers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror
<br/>that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and
<br/>had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four
<br/>feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attain-
<br/>ed the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly
<br/>and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and
<br/>the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, up-
<br/>on which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the
<br/>Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of de-
<br/>spair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into
<br/>the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall
<br/>figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the
<br/>ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the
<br/>grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled
<br/>with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>
         <p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red
<br/>Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by
<br/>one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their
<br/>revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
<br/>And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last
<br/>of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And
<br/>Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable do-
<br/>minion over all.</p>

         <p>The Avon bard has sung in sweet tune, and we, essaying to
<br/>make the belief ours, hum after him, “ What’s in a name?”
<br/>But experience has an opposing conviction ; it rises up with
<br/>the argument, much is in a name, and each of us has many
<br/>clinging associations to maintain the affirmative. How
<br/>eagerly we inquire the name baptismal name especially,) of
<br/>a person whom we have not yet seen, and how hastily, deter-
<br/>mine his appearance, whether he will be agreeable, or
<br/>repellent to us, from our association with what he is
  <br/>called.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>So it is; we are creatures of strange prejudices; these,
<br/>though, are not wholly unaccountable. We can sometimes
<br/>trace their origin back even to our cradles. The first lullaby
<br/>we have any recollection of, is linked with a name, loved for
<br/>the one who hushed us into rest with its soothing strain ; or
<br/>recurs to us unpleasantly as we remember some discordant
<br/>chiding for our playful wakefulness. The sweet sound of
<br/>Viola at once creates a phantom of loveliness. And what
<br/>more appropriate name for a sunny faced, budding little
<br/>beauty, than Rosa. And Mary, the pet call with so many,
<br/>in all degrees of life. It graces the lonely cot, and softens
<br/>the splendor of the palace. The downcast, modest eye, and
<br/>fair Madonna brow, steal upon you, with the graceful tie of
<br/>piety and love, attached for so many centuries to the gentle
<br/>sound.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>With what nicety an author selects a title for his romance !
<br/>he well knows what depends on it ; frequently the remark
<br/>has reached us, “ I will read it, if I like the name.” “ The
<br/>Pirate,” charming—we are certain here is a rich treat of love
<br/>and venture; already we are interested in the hero, though he
<br/>may be</p>
         <div class="ab">“Link’d with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.”
</div>
         <p>It is needless for me to enumerate more instances of the
<br/>tenacity with which our prejudices hold to us, (for all can
<br/>recall likes and dislikes, associated with names and places,)
<br/>but I will hasten to relate one which followed me for many
<br/>years like a grim spectre.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first horror that presented itself to me at the threshold
<br/>of discernible life, was the woman who presided over the
<br/>department of edibles in my father’s house. She was the
<br/>cook par excellence, and we the envied of the neighbourhood.
<br/>Whenever a dinner or supper was to be given, (even in the
<br/>most remote house of the block,) she was duly consulted as
<br/>to the propriety of such and such dishes, which in her im-
<br/>portant opinion should be placed the first before the guests.
<br/>If it chanced we wished any change, the suggestion was po-
<br/> litely made, for none ventured to find fault with her arrange-
<br/>ments. At once the assurance was given, that it was “ dress-
<br/>ed precisely in the manner my lord had it served up to him,
<br/>and surely such quality knew what good eating was.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This was a quietus to the matter; and the dish was tasted
<br/>of by all, to which “ my lord” had set his imperishable seal
<br/>of approbation in the brain of our good cook. Thanks to
<br/>her, for my first impression of the blessings of a Republic,
<br/>as my youthful fancy pictured the frightful rule of lords, and
<br/>a land where people could not eat what best pleased them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Follow me now into her empire no Sultana ever swayed
<br/>her waiting-woman with more despotic rule, than she the
<br/>other domestics of the house. Every article had its place.
<br/>The saucepans hung in a row and told of the labor be-
<br/>stowed upon them. The kitchen was radiant with the glow of
<br/>the tortured metal. If one passed, and accidentally unhung
<br/>a skewer from its culinary gibbet, the tumult was enough to
<br/>give rise to the supposition that the premises were crumbling
<br/>in, and utter destruction inevitable, unless the spot was
<br/>speedily vacated.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The name of this wonder of my juvenile days, was Hannah
<br/>Johnson; she was a native of England, and had come to this
<br/>country to live with her son, Samuel Johnson. I know not
<br/>if he boasted being of the lineage of his illustrious predecessor
<br/>and LL. D., of the same name, but he was a clever young
<br/>man, and filled his calling with propriety. He was a super-
<br/>numerary clerk in my father’s counting-house, transacting
<br/>some little of the business, and performing all the menial re-
<br/>quirements. Samuel was the surviving child of five. Only <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page20"/>
a few months the mother and son realised the comfort of be-
<br/>ing together; he also died, and the mother was left destitute.
<br/>My father being aware of this, arrangements were made,
<br/>and she was received at home, where her grief was soon
<br/>dispelled by the continued employment she had allotted her-
<br/>self.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In appearance, she will stand for time immemorial, unique.
<br/>She was tall, far above the usual height of women, and
<br/>muscular, as though she had practised gymnastic exercises all
<br/>her life; undeniably belonging to the “locomotive order.”
<br/>Her eyes were large, pale blue, and protruding. Hair of the
<br/>peculiar dapple grey I have always given in my fancy to
<br/>witches, parted smoothly on her yellow seamed forehead,
<br/>and adorned by a snowy white linen cap, with a border about
<br/>four inches wide, standing erect around her face in bold de-
<br/>fiance, looking as if the fashion of Queen Bess’ frill was re-
<br/>vived again, and rebelliously mounted to encircle a face, in-
<br/>stead of cautiously standing up in ready defence for the neck.
<br/>Her gown was composed of that blue domestic spotted with
<br/>white, which was at one time the usual working attire of
<br/>people in her capacity, but now has entirely faded from
<br/>sight, and almost recollection. Upon great occasions, this
<br/>was thrown aside for a calamanco, she had “bought when
<br/>dear George was a baby, and if he had lived, he would have
<br/>been nine the day she left for this country,” and fixed in my
<br/>memory, for seventeen years she was a moveable in our house,
<br/>and still the rustling dress was presentable. The dress so far
<br/>met with my approval, but her neck-gear was a dense mys-
<br/>tery, and the cause of many a strange surmise. Winter and
<br/>summer it was wrapt in a strip of red flannel, which was
<br/>never laid aside, unless to be replaced by a similar piece,
<br/>whilst the cast off underwent a washing, and was stretched
<br/>on a little board for the noon-day sun to dry. Whether it
<br/>was intended as a preventive against affections of the
<br/>throat, or a slow cure, or perhaps a talisman, I never could
<br/>ascertain; still, year in, and year out, the rubyish necklace
<br/>obstinately obtruded on the eye. I never since have met with
<br/>any one who was not accessible in some way : all the blan-
<br/>dishments of childhood were used, pins, needles, thread-
<br/>cases, and even pinafores were purchased for her out of
<br/>my pocket-money, in hopes of getting a little kindness in re-
<br/>turn. A portion of each Sunday evening, I left the family
<br/>circle, and spent reading to Hannah, and never concluded
<br/>the favor, without going over her choicest selection, “The
<br/>order for the burial of the dead,” from, “ I am the resurrection
<br/>and the life,” to the close, which always drew forth her most
<br/>hearty “ amen.” Affection she had for none, except for an
<br/>old black cat, that at night slept by her feel, and mewed at
<br/>them through the day. In the animal creation, this was the
<br/>only living thing that elicited her admiration. Black and
<br/>sleek she was, without one white hair to redeem her in my
<br/>estimation from the name of jet; but this was not the naming
<br/>suited to her; she was called Blanche, after one of “my
<br/>lord’s” accomplished danghters. The said cat, and a bundle
<br/>of patches, comprised her earthly treasure; the latter she
<br/>reverently looked over occasionally, and pointed out: “ this
<br/>was dear John’s, this that blessed boy, Sammy’s, &amp;c.,” until
<br/>she had shown a sample of the clothes once worn by each
<br/>of her departed children.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Gratitude was held by her to be the crowning virtue,
<br/>though it was never manifested in words or deeds of love,
<br/>but cold, rigid justice ; “ ingratitude,” she would say, “is the
<br/>blackest of crimes." “Yes, Hannah,” my brother Harry
<br/>would playfully reply, “he that's ungrateful has no guilt
<br/>but one; all other crimes may pass for virtues in him.” “ Oh !
  <br/>that poesy, Mister Harry, was made for the drawing-room,<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>and folk what don’t like anything but what’s dressed up, but,
<br/>for my part, I say in plain English, it’s no better than steal-
<br/>ing.” Yet, with this unexceptionable sentiment, she was the
<br/>most disagreeable person I ever encountered. Her very
<br/>name, Hannah, was hateful to me.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If any of my schoolmates were so unfortunately called,
<br/>they seldom knew any of my indulgence. I would not prompt
<br/>them in a lesson, or assist with an exercise, and preferred to
<br/>be alone to being escorted by Hannahs. When I studied
<br/>Mythology, I wondered if Proserpine did not wear a red ban-
<br/>dage around her neck as a mark of designation for the queen
<br/> of hell. I sometimes thought she might be Lot’s wife come
<br/>back to earth to atone for her disobedience; so rocky, so un-
<br/>womanly was she.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>When I was about fourteen my mother laid before me
<br/>several works she especially wished me to read. This I
<br/>thought no hardship, (for I was fond of reading), until my
<br/>eye fell upon “Life and Writings of Hannah More.” I was
<br/>electrified, and quietly slipped the volumes back into the book
<br/>case, ejaculating (wittily as I thought) “ pray, no more Han-
<br/>nah !”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In vain I urged her removal from the house, as a nuisance.
<br/>Mother said she was an invaluable creature; my father pitied
<br/>her loneliness, and Harry; the sharer of my joys and sorrows,
<br/>liked to have her to plague and laugh at. Once, and only
<br/>once, was she tenderly moved for one of us. I was ill,—a
<br/>tear glistened in her eye as she hoped “ Miss Kate would not
<br/>die, for who else would read to her.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Thus time sped on. My brother who was in the navy,
<br/>and had been for nearly three years kept at southern sta-
<br/>tions, wrote to us. He had “at last concluded to light up
<br/>the dreariness of life, and take to himself a wife.” He de-
<br/>scribed the lady as highly intelligent, and quite pretty
<br/>enough ; but did not give her name. However, I was de-
<br/>lighted at the prospect of Harry’s future happiness, and plea-
<br/>sed with the thought of having so companionable a person
<br/>for my sister. The next letter dealt the blow,—she was call-
<br/>ed Hannah Fairfax. Fairfax contented me, but Hannah, oh
<br/>horror ! how could I receive her without giving offence ?
<br/>Impossible! I never could like her. Treat her as a sister ?
<br/>No, no, the welcome she met with must come from others
<br/>of the family, for Kate Rodney would be out of the way
<br/>when another Hannah arrived. Thoughts like these ran
<br/>through my silly head. I said little about the wedding, or
<br/>our expected guest, but my nurtured prejudice was suspect-
<br/>ed, and spoken of by my fond mother, though she did not
<br/>endeavor to dissuade me from it, but left it to the removal of
<br/>time and reason. We were all on the stilts of expectation ;
<br/>even myself, though I differed from the rest, for I lamented
<br/>the pain I inevitably would cause my brother.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Night—a winter night again gathered us around the bright,
<br/>peaceful hearth of home. My father was reading aloud,
<br/>whilst my mother was webbing some fancy article for one
<br/>of the gifts of love and welcome to the unknown comer. I,
<br/>apparently was idle, but in reality busily engaged, far in a
<br/>chaotic reverie of pleasure and disappointment; when it was
<br/>broken in upon by the sound of stopping carriage wheels, and
<br/>a well known voice in the hall told me Harry and the shock
<br/>had arrived. I closed my eyes as he entered the parlor, but
<br/>opened them, (for I had nerved myself) when I heard him
<br/>say, “here dear father and mother is your daughter Hannah."
<br/>My head reeled; a revolution had taken place. I thought he
<br/>said “Heavenly,” and not “Hannah." Unconsciously I uttered,
<br/>"Angelic !’’ for such was the being who was encircled in our
<br/>mother’s arms. She was one of the most lovely I ever look-
<br/>ed upon,—her soft hazel, beseeching eyes, asked for love,—<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page21"/>
her forehead was low, but faultlessly white, and draped by j
folds of the richest black hair Her form was a Houri’s.
</p>
         <p>Daily this gentle being won upon me. She was the love-
<br/>ly moonlight to our summer home; every one loved her, in-
<br/>deed it was impossible not to. The bliss of her husband
<br/>seemed entire, and I trembled lest it was too much for earth,
<br/>and ere long would be interrupted. Wherever I went I
<br/>wished Hannah with me. A party had not its complement
<br/>of beauty if she was not there. A book read with but half
<br/>the zest, if she did not peruse it with me ; in fact she had
<br/>become an essential in my cup of happiness. Still her name
<br/>was not wholly endurable, for a long time. I called her
<br/>Annie. At last an event occurred which was to be the buri-
<br/>al of my prejudice,—the birth of a daughter. It was deter-
<br/>mined the little stranger should be called Hannah,—the
<br/>name of my sister’s mother, whose memory she cherished,
<br/>with the sacredness of an affectionate daughter and sensitive
<br/>woman. How dearly I loved this liny one ! Scarcely a cap
<br/>could be found pretty enough for the velvety face, or socks
<br/>soft as the dainty wee feet they were to enclose. This little
<br/>love was another jewel to our diadem of happy home,—
<br/>never were one and all more joyous.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Even old Hannah looked well pleased, and hobbled in to
<br/>the christening, for she had two reasons for wishing to be
<br/>there. “ Mr. Rodney had been even as kind as ' my lord,’
<br/>and she had seen all his children christened,” (to witness the
<br/>baptism of a grandchild was I presume a greater pleasure
<br/>and compliment.) “Then Miss Kate, the baby’s name is
<br/>just what I like.” For better than a year she had been una-
<br/>ble to work, but imagined her control not yet at an end, and
<br/>actually hastened the decline of years, grieving over the
<br/>waste which must be during her absence; retaining only
<br/>breath to utter her final amen as she beckoned me to her bed
<br/>side, and pointed to the prayer book.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Poor Hannah ! that she had an annoying temper none can
<br/>deny, but she practised virtues many do not even compre-
<br/>hend—justice and gratitude.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A miniature Babel is below stairs ;—the fourth anniversary
<br/>of the birth of aunty’s pet; and she must join the little revel-
<br/>lers in a game of “ hot butter blue beans” or “ blind man's
<br/>buff”, twine a wreath for the evening's Queen, and help eat
<br/>bon-bons. Oh the laughing ones ! lovely budding flowers,
<br/>each possessing an imperishable germ. To be in such an
<br/>assemblage of innocence and beauty, makes one feel very
<br/>young again ; if time or care has impressed a furrow, it is
<br/>hushed away for the present.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Reader, I can tarry with you no longer ; but thanks for list-
<br/>ening to my story, and if you hold a similar dislike to a name
<br/>because of a disagreeable person, then seek a lovelier associ-
<br/>ation to render it musical, and believe me you can succeed.
<br/>Our great will should not be kept subservient to prejudices.</p>

         <div class="head">The Antigone.
</div>
         <p>I had been to see the Antigone of Sophocles not long
<br/>since, and sate through the five acts and four choruses with
<br/>mingled feelings of pleasure at the recollections of my school-
<br/>boy love for antiquity, which the scenes and action recalled,
<br/>and of disappointment that the translation so feebly shadowed
<br/>the nervous language and imagery of the most philosophical
<br/>of tragedians. In fact, what Porson had said of Pope's Iliad,“ It is a very pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it
Homer,” seemed doubly applicable to the present instance.
</p>
         <p>I had left the theatre in this mood, thinking only of what I
<br/>had seen, not of what I had read, and at the door was ad-
<br/>dressed by Leslie, the Alcibiades of my acquaintance. He
<br/>thus addressed me : “ Come to my room, most Athenian, for
<br/>if I remember well, of all the band who walked with me
<br/>in the Academic Grove of Cambridge, you were the most
<br/>entirely Hellenic; come with me, and while I uncork some
<br/>wine of Cyprus, (it must be my substitute for Chian), we will
<br/>talk over the new Antigone and the old one, grow classical,
<br/>as we sacrifice to Dionusos, and fancy ourselves beneath the
<br/>shadow of the Hill of Mars, and inhaling the balmy air that
<br/>sweeps over Old OEgea, Plataea and Salamis.” Though
<br/>unused to revel “ late of nights,” the temptation was too
<br/>strong to be resisted.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Leslie was domiciled in a quiet street not far from Hudson
<br/>Park, a key to which he has, and often with him I sate, in
<br/>the shadow of its trees, and discoursed of similar themes.
<br/>On that night, however, we were in his library, in which was
<br/>more than one cast from the great modern and ancient sculp-
<br/>tors, and in which was found most that was valuable in the
<br/>reveries of philosophers and delicious in the dreams of poets.
<br/>Upon the table lay open a volume of Sophocles, with which
<br/>he had been evidently occupied, previous to leaving for the the-
<br/>atre, to which I naturally turned while he occupied himself
<br/>in bringing from an adjoining room, not a bottle, but a narrow
<br/>necked vessel with a handle of twined serpents on each side,
<br/>giving it a semblance to an ancient amphora, and two cya-
<br/>thoi, not glasses. In this, however, he was not strictly cor-
<br/>rect, and the vessel and cyathoi were evidently not Grecian
<br/>but Etruscan or Pelasgican their shape. “I brought these,”
<br/>said he, speaking to me, “ from Herculaneum, where I
<br/>bribed the keepers, as Italians of modern times may always
<br/>be bribed. I did it too with a safe conscience. I know not why
<br/>the King of Naples should monopolize what must have been
<br/>intended as a legacy to Posterity. The wine is a present
<br/>from the Captain of the brig AEgeus, in which I came hither
<br/>from Smyrna, in company with a midshipman, three Jews,
<br/>and a cargo of tigs. But, fill up, and let us drink to the
<br/>memory of the Athenian drama! After that we must deter-
<br/>mine whether one of the next cups shall not be to its Anas-
<br/>lasts."</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I had thrown myself upon a chaise longue, not unlike
<br/>the couch of the classic ages, and resting my head upon a
<br/>pillow which meetly might have supported Croesus in his
<br/>prosperous days, began to sip from the cyathos the delicious
<br/>wine, which reflected, in its purple depths, the delicate tra-
<br/>cery of vine-leaves and grapes, with which it was overlaid.
<br/>I know not how it was, but I remember that while Leslie
<br/>spoke one of those glittering phrases which fall from his
<br/>lips like drops of honey from Hybla, and whose subject was
<br/>Alcibiades, I fell asleep. It may be that, inclined somewhat
<br/>to the philosophy of the porch, the strong Cyprus had over-
<br/>come my senses, and that I had poured too deep a libation
<br/>to Bacchus.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/> 
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page22"/>
         <p>Straight it seemed to me that Alcibiades entered, clad in
<br/>the rich and spotless dress of his day, with the crimson bus-
<br/>kin and Median train. Perfumes dripped from his waving
<br/>hair, and many a jewel sparkled upon his marble fingers.
<br/>Without more ado, he threw himself beside us, and filling
<br/>from the amphora a beaker, with his fingers filliped a few
<br/>drops upon an inkstand, fashioned in the shape of an ancient
<br/>altar, murmured the word “ Dionuso,” and quaffed it down
<br/>bocca aperta.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Your wine,” said he, “ is good ; I like most, however,
<br/>the rich Italian and Ionian wines. That of Chios and Cy-
<br/>prus is too strong and heavy for me ; yet Salustius, a Roman,
<br/>who, 450 Olympiads since, joined us enerthen, tells me that
<br/>the wines of Falernum are thrice as strong as this. Antho-
<br/>ny Hamilton tells me that those of Spain, and that grown in
<br/>islands of which we had not very vivid ideas—our Islands
<br/>of the Blest, are yet more potent; verily as the world grows
<br/>older, your taste for excitement increases.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This remark astonished me, because, though, as the great
<br/>master of the porch had taught, I believe in the identity and
<br/>personality of the dead in Hades, I had no idea they lived so
<br/>sociably as Alcibiades seemed to insinuate; at the lime, how-
<br/>ever, I did not speak of it, thinking, possibly, that it might
<br/>not be polite to recall to a gentleman and a stranger that he
<br/>was a subject of the Plutonian realm. I fancy that my
<br/>distaste to this, was, in character, similar to the feeling a
<br/>well-bred Englishman would entertain at asking an Ameri-
<br/>can the news from Pennsylvania. “ We drank,” continued
<br/>he, “some tolerable wine, grown in the neighborhood of
<br/>AEtna, last night, which was not unlike this, and, as we sat
<br/>over our cups, I heard that a tragedy of old Sophocles’ was
<br/>to be represented, and could not resist the temptation to visit
<br/>anothen again. I was fond of Sophocles.”</p>
         <p>“ But,” said Leslie, “ I knew not that you gentlemen sha-
dows often visited us.”
</p>
         <p>“ We do not. It has been some years since I was up.—
<br/>It was when a mad fellow named Bozzaris, near the field of
<br/>old Plataea, fought with and conquered the Scythian horde,
<br/>who now have possession of the soil of Hellas.”</p>
         <p>" Oh !” said I, “ you have heard of Bozzaris.”
</p>
         <p>“Yes, a poetaster, a countryman of your own, named
<br/>Drake, some four Olympiads since, joined us, and recited
<br/>some glorious verses, which served as a fitting introduction
<br/>for him to the whole population of Hades. Besides, some of
<br/>us Greeks had previously heard of Bozzaris from countrymen
<br/>of our own, who had died in the strife with the Scythians,
<br/>(Turcomans you call them.)”</p>
         <p>“Well, the schoolmaster is abroad,” said Leslie, “he is
even gone to the Devil.”
</p>
         <p>“ I know not that word, or its precise meaning; some Io-
<br/>nians I have heard, speak of the Heiraoi ; they believe in a
<br/>power antagonist to their God, whom they cal! Diabolos."</p>
         <p>“I assure you, Diabolos is here all potent, almost as the
Hatui, of which your old tragedians spoke so much.”
</p>
         <p>“ You have, then, more than one God. Count Anthony
<br/>said you had but one. I did not, however, understand him,
<br/>as I knew your Allan tides were not Epicureans, and men
<br/>have loo many wants for one God to be able to attend them
<br/>all.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Conversation then waned for a moment, while we more
<br/>than once replenished our cyathoi from the amphora. It as-
<br/>tonished me somewhat that Alcibiades did not respond to
<br/>us while we drank his health, but, after a few moments, I
<br/>remembered that was a custom derived from our northern
<br/>progenitors. At length we began to speak of the subject
  <br/>matter, the Antigone, and Alcibiades remarked—</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
         <p>“ As I sate last night in the Koilon, I was pleased to see
<br/> that women sate in the lowest row, showing that the wives
<br/>and daughters of the principal citizens sate with them to wit-
<br/>ness the play : verily the cool determination of Eurydice and
<br/> of Antigone seemed to blanch their cheeks. Our fair Athe-
<br/> nians would not accompany us to such places:—true, Aspasia
<br/>did so, but then, you know, she was differently situated. A
<br/>rare woman was Aspasia.”</p>
         <p>“ Yes, we have heard of her.”
</p>
         <p>“The music pleases me; in that you have made great
<br/>improvements. You have adopted the brazen instruments
<br/>of the Medes and the delicate Spartan flute. The Medea of
<br/> Euripides would, from the joint accompaniment, have had a
<br/>double effect. Even the Ocean Nymphs, and the Gossamer
<br/>Spirits of the Air, who came to the crags of Caucasus to
<br/>console the Prometheus Desmotes, would have found a music
<br/>soft as their own voices.”</p>
         <p>“ What thought you then of the declamation ?”
</p>
         <p>“What could I think? The Creon was not so good as
<br/>Pratinas, or as other actors whom I have known, but he
<br/>knew his part and felt it. The words of Sophocles, if the actor
<br/>but feels them, cannot be marred. The Antigone and Euri-
<br/>dice were played so well, they seemed to me women.
<br/>Yet there were discords. I use that term to express things
<br/>to which I am unused. The appurtenances of the tiring
<br/>room seem to me incompatible. No Anax ever dressed as
<br/>Creon did ; where was his sword? and Eurydice wore the
<br/>crescent of a Priestess of Athena, not of a Grecian matron.
<br/>The tragedy, however, may not be marred ; indeed old Thes-
<br/>pis, in his wagon knew not, five hundred Olympiads ago, that
<br/>his fame would pass into the Atlantis, of which Plato had
<br/>not yet written. Your Bronteion, too, is strangely placed :
<br/>the lightning is from Jove, but the thunder is of Saturn;
<br/>yours was, I know not where, it seemed to pervade the
<br/>whole house; but reach me yon amphora ! I will quaff a cup
<br/>and make a libation to the Hatai: let us sacrifice to them and
<br/>propitiate them.”</p>
         <p>“But our theatre is small.”
</p>
         <p>“Ah, yes, the very Koilon is not so large as the mere
<br/>Episkenion of our theatres, which were two stadia in breadth,
<br/>and made to contain the whole population of Athens, while
<br/> yours can only contain your wealthiest citizens, those of for-
<br/>tune. The slave at the door asked of me for admittance an
<br/>Attic talent of gold at Athens the price was half an obolus.
<br/> The great and useful scenes our drama portrays, should, too,
<br/> be represented in the open air, not within walls. The mar-
<br/>ble columns and seats, the beauty of the caryatidae, and the
<br/>severe and stern serenity of the works of the older sculptors,
<br/>well befitted the severity of AEschylus, and the philosophy of
<br/>Sophocles; for Euripides, another model of decoration might
<br/>be adopted, but it would not be that of the Atrion where I
<br/>saw the Antigone.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Reach me again yon amphora. The wine I have usually
<br/> drank for the last 450 Olympiads, has grown near AEtna or
<br/>Vesuvius, and has a sulphury twang, not so pleasant as
<br/>this.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ One or two things,” said Leslie, “ I wish to ask you of
<br/>the ancient drama—and the first is, who were the chorus,
<br/>and where were they placed ? Had they part in the play ?"</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ The chorus were musicians, and as the science of har-
<br/>mony was not so far advanced as it is now, our instruments
<br/>were fewer, and the greater part of their music was vocal;
<br/>they had no part in the action of the play, except that they
<br/>wore the costume of the age of the actors, and during the
<br/>changing of the scene, spoke in explanations of allusions,
<br/>with which the mass of the audience were not familiar.”</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/> 
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page23"/>
         <br/>
         <p>“Did your tragic actors wear masks?”
  </p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ Masks ? what are they ?”</p>
         <p>
            <br/>“ Coverings for the face, representing the passion supposed
    <br/>to characterize the personage they assumed.’’</p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ How could that be ? Creon even has his joy, and it must
    <br/>be expressed, the mask would destroy all expression.”</p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ Whence can we have derived the idea ?”</p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ Our actors painted, covering the whole face, often thick-
    <br/>ly enough, that possibly may explain the idea.”</p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ I do not,” said Leslie, “ see how it was possible for the
<br/>human voice to reach over the vast extent of your theatres: 
<br/>even our actors cannot always fill up the circumference of
    <br/>the buildings in which they perform ?”</p>
         <br/>
         <p>“ Ah,” said Alcibiades, “ we had various contrivances for
<br/>the purpose of increasing the sound ; among other things, we 
<br/>used echeea, or their various vases of brass, like to the Egyp- 
<br/>tian tumpanon, by which the sound was prolonged, and sent 
<br/>in reverberation to the very verge of the Koilon. These
<br/>vases were placed upon pedestals, upon which they rested
<br/>by the contact of but a single point. Over these echeea,
<br/>which were interspersed through the building, seals were
<br/>placed, lest the architectural beauty of the building should
<br/>be marred by their presence. Your vaulted dome must be
<br/>a great improvement, and a voice of ordinary capacity must,
<br/>beneath it, be able to reach with distinctness every ear. At
<br/>Athens, by the gesture alone, was the actor recognised, and
<br/>that alone was necessary, for every Athenian knew the works
<br/>of the great Tragedian, as you, doubtless, of your master
<br/>pieces, and could easily supply any word which he did not
<br/>hear.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ There were other differences which struck me, too ; they 
<br/>are not, however, material. The curtain now falls from the
<br/>roof of the building, on the stage : it was with us drawn up.
<br/>Usually before the curtain rose, the chorus had taken their
<br/>places, and the Coryphceus, the Aggelos, usually the first
<br/>character, spoke the long introductory to the action. It of-
<br/>ten seemed to me to be regretted that our tragedians did not
<br/>adopt some more artful manner of introducing the plot; the
<br/>custom, however, of all tragedians, has permanently fixed
<br/>the rule."</p>
         <p>“Did the chorus dance?”
</p>
         <p>“Not generally; if, however, it was composed of fe-
<br/>males, it did dance. There was a place called orches-
<br/>tra, in our theatres; the word was handed down to us
<br/>from the very days of Thespis, though its reason, long
<br/>before, disappeared. The chorus usually clustered around
<br/>their coryphoeus, who stood on the thumele, where was the
<br/>altar."</p>
         <p>“ The music you have heard to-day, differs from that of
your nation ?’’
</p>
         <p>“Ah, yes ! ours was monotone, like a Sapphic stanza, fin-
<br/>ite and beautiful, not running, as yours does, infinitely through
<br/>all the changes of Choric verse. Ah, you have much that
<br/>we were ignorant of: mere music with us, was a womanly
<br/>art, or rather, a slavish one: with you, however, a poet and
<br/>philosopher may, without error, devote themselves to so glo-
<br/>rious an accomplishment.”</p>
         <p>“ There is one thing more. I did not see you during the
representation; yet, with your graceful and peculiar dress,
I cannot well see how you escaped observation.”
“ Up early enough, the Dianusiakoi Technitoi gave me a
private box.”
</p>
         <p>When I heard this, I remembered that I had seen the
<br/>sleeve of a white robe, and a jewelled finger occasionally
<br/>on the outside of the left balcony box! we then sate for
  <br/>for some time, and conversed together. Alcibiades said<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>some prettinesses relative to our number, which was that
<br/>of the Graces, and other similar things, with which I did not
<br/>charge my memory, for, recurring to the days of the per-
<br/>fection of Grecian drama, I naturally used the system of
<br/>mnemonics then in vogue, which I will remark, is not near
<br/>so good as that of Professor Gouraud, whose lectures I have
<br/>attended, and whose octavo I have read.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Alcibiades took hold again of the amphora : it was dry.
<br/>While I thought Leslie moved to substitute for it another,
<br/>I awoke, strangely enough; I was alone, except that my
<br/>host slept soundly; the cyathos overturned, and the Cyprus
<br/>wine streaming over his bosom. I went home, and began
<br/>to write out this imaginary conversation, which I have just
  <br/>now finished.</p>

         <div>
            <div class="head">Dear Mrs. S——,</div>
            <p>I write to you, without an answer to my last. As I
<br/>cannot return to my children at present, you must relate to
<br/>me every thing about them. Please to send me an account
<br/>of the state of James’ room, when he leaves it in the morn-
<br/>ing. He is not as yet so neat and considerate as I wish. I
<br/>have no severity of feeling on such subjects : carelessness
<br/>may exist with justice and kindness, and its demonstrations
<br/>not only be inferior to, but in contrariety with the disposition.
<br/>He is rather more short of his own ideal than some of the
<br/>rest. I recommend to him for a motto,</p>
            <div class="ab">  "Heaven loves the ideal which practises too.”</div>
            <p>This is a line of Leigh Hunt’s, which I read this morning.
<br/>I have had great pleasure in turning over the new edition of
<br/>his poems, just collected in a little volume, where, amidst
<br/>too much that is vapid and grovelling, there is some of the
<br/>finest of the fine, I find the story of Ben Adhem somewhat
<br/>impaired.</p>
            <div class="ab"> “ Write me as one that loves his fellow men,”</div>
            <div class="ab">for</div>
            <div class="ab">“ Ecrivez-moi en quality d’amie de ceux qui aiment Dieu,”</div>
            <div class="ab">is a less easy and natural transition.</div>
            <div class="ab">“ Captain Sword and Captain Pen” is very much to the
  <br/>purpose.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Captain Sword,
<br/>...... forget the close thought, and the burning heart,
<br/>And prayers, and the mild moon hanging apart,
<br/>Which lifteth the seas with her gentle looks,
<br/>And growth, and death, and immortal books,
<br/>And the Infinite Wildness, the soul of souls,
<br/>Which layeth earth soft with her silver poles;
<br/>Which ruleth the stars and saith not a word;
<br/>Whose speed in the hair of no comet is heard ;
<br/>Which sendeth the soft sun, day by day,
<br/>Mighty, and genial, and just alway ;
<br/>Owning no difference, doing no wrong,
<br/>Loving the orbs and the least bird’s song ;
<br/>The great, sweet, warm angel with golden rod,
<br/>Bright with the smile of the distance of God.”
<br/>“ Indestructible souls among men
<br/>Were the souls of the line of Captain Pen ;
<br/>Sages, patriots, martyrs mild
<br/>Going to the stake, as child
<br/>Goeth with his prayer to bed:
  <br/>Dungeon-beams from quenchless head ;
<br/>Poets making earth aware
<br/>Of its wealth in good and fair.”</div> 
            <p> Are not these capital passages? You will enter with all
<br/>your heart into what he says about fishing, and “Izaak.”
<br/>“ Bodryddan” is dearly beautiful: it makes the reader feel truly,</p>
            <div class="ab">	" That earth also is a star”</div>
            <div class="ab">worthy of her

               <br/>" That sat retired in reverend chair,
<br/>Fading heavenward beauteously
<br/>In a long-drawn life of love.”</div>
            <div class="ab">There have been many good words about clocks and bells,
but these are memorable:—</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>" Lost on the roof, a clock’s old grace
<br/>Looked forth like some enchanted face
<br/>That never slept, but in the night
<br/>Dinted the air with thoughtful might
<br/>Of sudden tongue, which seemed to say,
<br/>‘ The stars are firm and hold their way ’ ”</div>
            <div class="ab">“An Angel in the House,” “Songs of the Flowers,” are
<br/>most choice. I thought I would have done with quoting, but
<br/>here are two lines describing martyrdom, which I must co-
<br/>py;—</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>" Now, now he gives the skies
<br/>The heart they gave (sweet thought 'gainst bitter wonders! )”</div>
            <p>There are some lines my fingers can scarcely resist, in
<br/>“ To Kosciusko,” “ To the Author of Ion,” “Our Cottage,”
<br/>“ Reflections of a Dead Body,” noble pieces. You will pick 
<br/>them out.</p>
            <p>Part of the revelling in a book of value is its evocation of
<br/>wonders that lie in the past. Hunt’s beautiful illustrations
<br/>of the “ Divine Mildness,” recalled Milton’s description of our
<br/>unconscious diurnal revolution:</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/> “ Or she from west her silent course advance
<br/>With inoffensive pace, that spinning sleeps
<br/>On her soft axle, while she paces even,
   <br/>And bears thee soft with the smooth air along.”</div>
            <p>The “ One that sat Retired” in “ Bodryddan,” brought to
<br/>mind a beautiful passage in a lecture of Hudson’s—that on
<br/>“All’s Well that Ends Well.” The Countess Rousillon is
<br/>to him, as he said, one of Shakspeare’s choicest fancies. It
<br/>has a hold on his affections, reminding him of an ancient
<br/>gentlewoman, “who was his friend in childhood, whose
<br/>head had blossomed for the grave, and her heart for heaven;
<br/>one to whom, if he had anything good he owed it. She told
<br/>me,” he said, “ the story of the Babes in the Wood, the Cap-
<br/>tivity of the Jews. I can never read of this Divine Countess
<br/>without thinking of that heavenly old child.” At the closing
<br/>words of this tender and beautiful sketch, a feeling burst of
<br/>sympathy, delicately subdued, came from the audience.
<br/>Gresset’s words were never more fit:—</p>
            <div class="lg">  
               <br/>Voir avec clairte,
<br/>Que l’homme n’est point fait pour la mechantete,
<br/>Consultez, ecoutez pour juges, pour oracles,
<br/>Les hommes rassembles ! voyez a nos spectacles,
<br/>Quand on peint quelque trait de candeur, de bonte,
<br/>Ou brille en tout son jour la tendre humanite,
<br/>Tous les coeurs son remplis d’une volupte pure,
<br/>Et c’est la qu’ on entend le cri de la nature.</div>
            <p>What a lovely phrase, “heavenly old child”! Hunt avoids
both “ old lady” and “ old woman.”</p>
            <p>I am very glad you think with me as to walking in the
<br/>fields with the children. I have heard you say, what is very
<br/>just, “ how much more can be seen in a walk than a drive !”
<br/>This excellent modem invention of gum-shoes enables the
<br/>lady’s foot to reach the lovely marsh flowers. I have found
<br/>lately improvement to all parts of my own nature from ram-
<br/>bles in the woods and fields, and my attention has been
<br/>turned more than ever to the beauty of flowers. I have been
<br/>Steeped in poetry lately, turning over the American poets to
<br/>enjoy the descriptions you allude to in one of your late let-
<br/>ters. I am now sorry that my intended embellishments of
<br/>wild flowers must leave behind the charm of their native
<br/>haunts. These, may my children search annually all their
<br/>lives! May every spring be to them, what it has been to
<br/>me always a new spring ! May they see, time after time,
  <br/>what Bryant saw,</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ When violets lean
<br/>O’er wandering brooks and things unseen,
<br/>Or columbines in purple drest.
<br/>Nod o’er the ground-bird’s hidden nest.”</div>
            <div class="ab">with Emerson—</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/> “ Beneath dim aisles in odorous beds,

<br/>Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.”</div>
            <div class="ab">with Street,</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Where its long rings uncurls the fern,
<br/>The violet, nestling low,
<br/>Casts back the white lid of its urn,
<br/>Its purple streaks to show.”</div>
            <div class="ab">May they share his feelings, when he exclaims,
</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Beautiful blossom ! first to rise
<br/>And smile beneath Spring’s wakening skies,
<br/>The courier of the band
<br/>Of coming flowers, what feelings sweet
<br/>Gush, as the silvery gem we meet
<br/>Upon its slender wand !</div>
            <div class="ab">Nor leave wandering for heat or cold, but see with Dana's
eyes delicate shadows embellish the expanse of snow.</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ A lovely tracery
<br/>Of branch aud twig, that naked tree
<br/>Of shadows soft and dim has wove,
   <br/>And spread so gently, that above
<br/>The pure white snow it seems to float
<br/>As if its darkening touch, through fear,
<br/>It held from thing so saintly dear”</div>
            <p>I was thanking you all the time for leading me this plea-
<br/>sant road. It puzzles me, by the way, how Bryant can com-
<br/>pare the gentian for color to the blue sky, since the blue is a
<br/>great deal darker; but I explain it by supposing he meant
<br/>that which grows in New York and south, which is, accord-
<br/>ing to Pursh, of a paler tint. Our gentiana crinita does not
<br/>I think express serenity, which it would, if it was of the
<br/>shade of the blue sky. Are you an observer of the express-
<br/>ion of flowers ? Burns, I suppose, considered the fox-glove
<br/>as expressive of dignity when he said,</p>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ The stately fox-glove fair to see,”</div>
            <div class="ab">and in that line,</div>
            <div class="lg">
               <br/>“ Wee, modest, crimson tipped flower.”</div>
            <br/>
            <p>doubtless he thought the low stature and rosy hue of the
<br/>daisy denoted blushing humility. To go back in imagina-
<br/>tion to June, the swamp honeysuckle seems to me the em-
<br/>blem of a beautiful country woman. I do not mean one un-
<br/>refined or illiterate, but full of naivete and careless graces,
<br/>like that one-sided flower, delighting the eye with its heaped
<br/>up cups and innocent whiteness.</p>
            <p>The kalmialatifolia seems like a beautiful duchess elegant-
<br/>ly dressed for a birthnight, yet with great precision, and with
<br/>decorations very elaborate and angular.</p>
            <p>Those plants which have a peculiar regularity of form, as
<br/>the galeum, and lysimachia quadrifolia, for instance, awaken
<br/>devotional feelings, as the hand of the divine architect seems
<br/>so obvious in their structure. A pinnate leaf has a voice.</p>
            <p>My brother has a patient now, (Mrs L.) whose recovery
<br/>is retarded by excessively sombre religious views. I think
<br/>it would have a tendency to cure her morbid fear of God, if
<br/>in the proper season, she could wander in the fields as I do,
<br/>and see the marmot eating grass, and then retreating to his
<br/>subterraneous castle, and the caterpillar devouring in perfect
<br/>peace the leaves of the milk-weed. If my brother’s unfor-
<br/>tunate patient had seen the benevolence of God exercised to
<br/>the animal creation, she would be very backward to con-
<br/>clude He could be otherwise than loving to human beings.
<br/>You would say perhaps, why not turn her attention to the
<br/>past blessings of her own lot ? But that might not have so
<br/>great a tendency to cure her dejection, because she has al-
<br/>was been too sickly to enjoy much.</p>

            <p>Henry says he observed two of my brother’s spruces re-
<br/>cently, and from having just read Harris’s book, he was in-
<br/>duced to search them for the false caterpillar, which he
<br/>found, and relieved the trees of seventy. Henry says
<br/>that Harris, for extending his protection over the trees, de-
<br/>serves from the Dryads their fairest wreath. Pray suggest
<br/>to James to examine our firs and pines.</p>

         </div>
         <div>
            <div class="head">August, 184-.
  Dear Mrs. M :—</div>
            <p>The letter of mine, which failed to reach
<br/>you, chiefly concerned Mary’s accident, but as you had an-
<br/>other of the same date equally particular, it is an unimport-
<br/>ant loss. James, who you know is always overrunning with
<br/>kindness to Mary, taxes his invention continually to amuse
<br/>her in her tedious confinement. This month of the cater-
<br/>pillars, for the sake of the month of the butterflies, he has
<br/>been looking up an old box and applying to me to furnish a
<br/>gauze cover with a string. Then he set off to the china
<br/>shop, where he procured a very little mug. This he filled
<br/>with the leaves of the carrot, on which the caterpillars of the
<br/>Asterias were feeding. The box was placed on Mary’s little
<br/>table, where it forms one of her amusements. Besides these,
<br/>he has introduced others, scanning every twig, and turning
<br/>up all the leaves in the garden to add to the stock. As they
<br/>are not very pretty creatures, in this stage of development,
<br/>he brings Mary only the full grown, just in season to secure
<br/>the fair sylph. Mary has a little book, in which she inserts
<br/>the description of the larva, leaving the page opposite blank
<br/>to receive the account of the creature in its perfect state. I
<br/>like this process, independent of the recreation necessary in
<br/>her present irksome condition. The habit of observation is
<br/>formed, and what can be more salutary to the mind, more in
<br/>harmony with itself, than to follow these divine processes?
<br/>The remarkable developement of this tribe must, conscious-
<br/>ly or unconsciously, keep alive the idea of personal improve-
<br/>ment. I think it one of the most luminous pages of</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="ab">“ The book of God before (us) set.”</div>
            <p>Mary is asking me to give up the pen to her. She thinks
<br/>she can fill up what remains of my sheet though unable to
<br/>complete a whole one, which she is discontented not to do,
<br/>when she writes to her mother, if she begins one. I give it
<br/>to her, meaning to continue my letter.</p>
            <p>Dear Mother :—I long to see you, but that you know
<br/>without my saying so, yet I love to write it. You do not
<br/>know how kind James is to me. Yes, that you must guess
<br/>at too. I hope I am improving, as I walk across the room
<br/>with less difficulty every day. You recollect that bunch of
<br/>the prettiest everlastings, that came up in the border last
<br/>spring. James, you remember, wished to have it spared,
<br/>as he says he likes even weeds, ever since he studied botany,
<br/>but that ought not to be called a weed, should it ? James
<br/>has been reading about all the gnaphaliums in North Ameri-
<br/>ca, in Gray, and all over the world in Rees. He says he
<br/>likes to know how many nations see the same flower. He
<br/>complains very much of that Dr. Gray for making us wait so
<br/>long for the rest of his book. But the everlasting, which I
<br/>was going to tell you about; lately some caterpillars were
<br/>found in webs on the top of the flowers. They ate the flor-
<br/>ets, and the white scales coming loose hid the webs. When
<br/>they grew large James brought them to me for my box that
<br/>Mrs. — says she has been telling you about. They are black
<br/>with stripes round, of yellow lines, spiny, with white dots in
    <br/>pairs. Mrs. M. tells me the butterfly comes out, after hang-<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>ing itself up, in about a fortnight, and is chiefly orange. I
<br/>mean, dear mother, to send you a chrysalis. James says he
<br/>has tried without success to rear the species you mentioned
<br/>in your letter to him, but they are described in Harris, creep-
<br/>ing and flying.</p>
            <p>James has brought me a little flower-pot, full of earth for
<br/>those that go into the ground. When they seem to be roam-
<br/>ing round and have left off eating, I put them on the top of
<br/>the earth and cover the pot with a gauze ; they go in, and in
<br/>ten days, I pour out the earth carefully, pick up the chrysalis,
<br/>and lay it on some cotton wool in a box, to stay till next
<br/>spring ; then the pot is ready for another.</p>
            <div class="ab">Yours, dearest mother,
Mary M.</div>
            <p>I begin anew, dear Mrs. M., as Mary has not filled the
<br/>sheet. James' room I visited, and will give you an exact
<br/>account. First, the top bed clothes were not turned over the
<br/>foot board as you direct—the window was open but a crack,
<br/>clothes changed lay on the floor instead of being put in the
<br/>clothes-bag. James had been walking on the beach to ga-
<br/>ther shells for Mary, and as he came home with his shoes
<br/>full of sand, it was poured out on the carpet. The clothes
<br/>that belonged in the wardrobe, were hanging, some over the
<br/>foot-board of the bed, some were on chairs, shoes every-where, 
  <br/>the dressing-table——! I am glad you never wish me to find
</p>
            <p>fault with your children, especially this most generous, kind-
<br/>hearted little fellow. I do not know but my affection is deep
<br/>enough to pull down, as it certainly is to build up with true
<br/>satisfaction ; but you are right in thinking the best and most-
<br/>beloved friend, is the most successful reformer. They will
<br/>listen to you as Dante did to Beatrice.</p>
            <p>You will like to hear of Alfred's punctuality. I received the
<br/>quarterly money at breakfast time, the first day of the month.
<br/>Indeed I was so sure of his faithfulness, I had promised to pay
<br/>a debt of Joseph’s that morning; so Joseph and I were much
<br/>relieved. Joseph hoped I should make him a short visit, as
<br/>soon as the children’s vocation was finished,but I tell him he
<br/>must wait till you return.</p>
            <p>We went to see your friend Mrs. T. lately. She took us
<br/> to the cemetery, which, in the newer parts, holds much I
<br/>thought beautiful. One of the late enclosures within its
<br/>hedge of thuga with its braided foliage, contained the trienta-
<br/>lis, the uva ursi, various Solomon’s seals, the epigoea, the Mit-
<br/>chelle, pyrolas of different species, most of the beautiful py-
<br/>rola maculata, enough of andromudas and elethias to make a
<br/>a necessary shade for the forest flowers. One, still later
<br/>planted, was enclosed with privet : how beautiful for such
<br/>a purpose, with its pure, white pyramidal tops of flowers
<br/>brightening its night of green ! Within, were many neottias,
<br/>whose sculpture-like, marbled leaves and spikes of white,
<br/>look so monumental. Here were all the lycopodiums, the
<br/>Linnoea, the gnaphalium margaritaceum, and a great variety
<br/>of ferns. In both, brilliant colors were avoided, and foreign
<br/>flowers—one of the last I wished for, the white rose. Why
<br/>have not we a while rose, but why should we have every
<br/>thing ? One colored flower was there: the witch hazel, the
<br/>autumn flower of whose leafless branches is almost as
<br/>beautiful an illustration of the immortal creature as the but-
<br/>terfly. The monument in each of these enclosures was em-
<br/>bellished by a beautiful design from Retsch’s Hamlet, one
<br/>by the angel keeping watch at the gate of the omb, and the
<br/>other by the Psyche striving heavenwards. With some want
<br/>of good taste, a butterfly, extricating itself from the sheath,
    <br/>was carved on Capt. ——stone. James, who has been
    <br/>drawing a good deal lately, and become very dexterous,
    <br/>drew with his pencil upon the marble, a beetle emerging
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/> 
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page26"/>
               <br/>from the earth ; however, when his back was turned, I suc-
<br/>ceeded in effacing the lines. You once enlightened me on
<br/>the falsity of contempt. I was always repelled by its ill-na-
<br/>ture. In the morning, James had been, as you might expect
    <br/>from his sweet disposition, quite annoyed with B—— for
    <br/>eyeing affectedly, in an indolent way, through the ring of a
<br/>whip he had in his hand, a negro girl who was passing, and
<br/>after we got home, I tried to make out his case to be the
<br/>same thing, thoughnot so obvious .Now, said I, that clumsy
<br/>form was the temple of a soul, and glorified by it, as the
<br/>meanest hovel is ennobled by having a bible in it. The cap-
<br/>tain did not look more unpromising, than the blunt, clumsy
<br/>black chrysalis of the lonely luna-moth. Ah! my friend, you
<br/>are no intellectual Swammerdamm!</p>

         <p>We do not know when we have seen in any American or
<br/>British Journal an article we have so much admired, or one
<br/>with whose opinions we have so thoroughly accorded, as
<br/>with a late review, by Mr. Whipple, of Mr. Griswold’s
<br/>“ Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century.” The paper
<br/>appeared in the last number of the whig Magazine. We
<br/>extract some passages relating to Tennyson. They seem to
<br/>us the very echo of thoughts which hitherto we have had an
<br/>opportunity of expressing only in conversation. The injus-
<br/>tice done in America to the magnificent genius of Tennyson
<br/>is one of the worst sins for which the country has to answer.</p>
         <p>Of all the successors of Shelley, he possesses the most sureness of
<br/>insight. He has a subtle mind, a keen, passionless vision. His
<br/>poetry is characterized by intellectual intensity, as distinguished
<br/>from the intensity of feeling. He watches his consciousness with
<br/>a cautious and minute attention, to fix, and condense, and shape in-
<br/>to form, the vague and mystical shadows of thought and feeling,
<br/>which glide and flit across it. He listens to catch the lowest whis-
<br/>perings of the soul. His imagination broods over the spiritual and
<br/>mystical elements of his being, with the most concentrated power.
<br/>His eye rests firmly oif an object, until it changes from film into
<br/>form. Some of his poems are forced into artistical shape, by the
<br/>most patient and painful intellectual processes. His utmost
<br/>strength is employed on those mysterious facts of consciousness,
<br/>which form the staple of the dreams and reveries of others. His
<br/>mind winds through the mystical labyrinths of thought and feeling,
<br/>with every power awake, in action, and wrought up to the highest
<br/>pitch of intensity. The most acute analysis is followed, step by
<br/>step, by a suggestive imagination, which converts refined abstrac-
<br/>tions into pictures, or makes them audible to the soul through the
<br/>most cunning combinations of sound. Everything that is done is
<br/>the result of labor. There is hardly a stanza in his writings, but
<br/>was introduced to serve some particular purpose, and could not be
<br/>omitted without injury to the general effect. Every thing has mean-
<br/>ing. Every idea was won in a fair conflict with darkness, or dis-
<br/>sonance, or gloom. The simplicity, the barrenness of ornament, in
<br/>some of his lines, are as much the result of contrivance as his most
<br/>splendid images. With what labor, for instance, with what atten-
<br/>tive watching of consciousness, must the following stanza have been
<br/>wrought into shape:</p>
         <div class="lg">
            <br/>“ All those sharp fancies, by down-lapsing thought
<br/>Stream’d onward, lost their edges, and did creep,
<br/>Roll’d on each other, rounded, smooth’d and brought
<br/>Into the gulfs of sleep.”</div>
         <p>This intense intellectual action is displayed in his delineations of
<br/>nature and individual character, as well as in his subjective gross-
<br/>ings into the refinements of his own consciousness. In describing
<br/>scenery, his microscopic eye and marvellously delicate ear, are ex-
<br/>ercised to the utmost in detecting the minutest relations and most
<br/>evanescent melodies of the objects before him, in order that his re-
<br/>presentation of it shall include everything which is important to its
<br/>full perception. His pictures of English rural scenery, among the
<br/>finest in the language, give the inner spirit as well as the outward
<br/>form of the objects, and represent them, also, in their relation to
<br/>the mind which is gazing on them ; but nothing is spontaneous; the
<br/>whole is wrought out elaborately by patient skill. The picture in
<br/>his mind is spread out before his detecting and dissecting intellect,
<br/>to be transferred to words, only when it can be done with the most
<br/>refined exactness, both as regards color, and form and melody. He
  <br/>takes into calculation the nature of his subject, and decides wheth-<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>er it shall be definitely expressed in images, or indefinitely
<br/>through tone, or whether both modes shall be combined. His ob-
<br/>ject is expression, in its true sense; to reproduce in other minds
<br/>the imagination or feeling which lies in his own ; and he adopts the
<br/>method which seems best calculated to effect it. He never will
<br/>trust himself to the impulses of passion, even in describing passion.
<br/>All emotion, whether turbulent or evanescent, is passed through
<br/>his intellect, and curiously scanned. To write furiously, would to
<br/>him appear as ridiculous, and as certainly productive of confusion,
<br/>as to paint furiously, or carve furiously. We only appreciate his
<br/>art, when we consider that many of his finest conceptions and most
<br/>sculptural images, originally appeared in his consciousness as form-
<br/>less and mysterious emotions, having seemingly no symbols in na-
<br/>ture or thought.</p>
         <p>If our position is correct, then most certainly nothing can be
<br/>more incorrect than to call any poem of Tennyson’s unmeaning.
<br/>Such a charge simply implies a lack in the critic’s mind, not in the
<br/>poet’s. The latter always means something, in everything he
<br/>writes; and the form which it is embodied is chosen with the most
<br/>careful deliberation. It seems to us that the purely intellectual ele-
<br/>ment in Tennyson’s poetry, has been overlooked, owing perhaps to
<br/>the fragility of some of his figures and the dreariness of outline ap-
<br/>parent in others. Many think him to be a mere rhapsodist, fertile
<br/>in nothing but a kind of melodious empiricism. No opinion is
<br/>more contradicted by the fact. Examine his poetry minutely, and
<br/>the wonderful artistical finish becomes evident. There are few
<br/>authors who will bear the probe of analysis better.</p>
         <p>The poetry of Tennyson is, moreover, replete with magnificent
<br/>pictures, flushed with the finest hues of language, and speaking to
<br/>the eye and the mind with the vividness of reality. We not only
<br/>see the object, but feel the associations connected with it. His
<br/>language is penetrated with imagination ; and the felicity of his
<br/>epithets leaves nothing to desire. “ Godiva” is perfect as regards
<br/>taste and the skill evinced in compelling the mind of the reader to
<br/>sympathize with all the emotions of the piece. Like the generality
<br/>of Tennyson’s poems, though short, it contains elements of interest
<br/>capable of being expanded into a much larger space. But the poem
<br/>which probably displays to the best advantage his variety of power,
<br/>is “ The Gardener's Daughter.” It is flushed throughout with the
<br/>most ethereal imagination, though the incidents and emotions come
<br/>home to the common heart, and there is little appearance of elabo-
<br/>ration in the style. It is bathed in beauty—perfect as a whole, and
<br/>finished in the nicest details with consummate art. There is s seem-
<br/>ing copiousness of expression with a real condensation; and the
<br/>most minute threads of thought and feeling,—so refined as to be
<br/>overlooked in a careless reading, yet all having relation to the gen-
<br/>eral effect,—are woven into the texture of the style, with the most
<br/>admirable felicity. “ Locksley Hall,” Aenone,” “ The May
<br/>Queen,” “Ulysses,” “ The Lot s Eaters,” “ The Lady of Shalott.’’
<br/>“ Marianna,” “ Dora,” " The Two Voices,” “ The Dream of Fair
<br/>Women,” “ The Palace of Art,” all different, all representing a pe-
<br/>culiar phase of nature or character, are still all characterized by the
<br/>cunning workmanship of a master of expression, giving the most
<br/>complete form to the objects which his keen vision perceives. The
<br/>melody of verse, which distinguishes all, ranging from the deepest
<br/>organ tones to that</p>
         <div class="lg"> 
            <br/>" Music which gentlier on the spirit lies,
<br/>Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes,”</div>
         <br/>
         <div class="ab">is also of remarkable beauty, and wins and winds its way to the
<br/>very fountains of thought and feeling.</div>

         <div class="head">Young America.</div>
         <p>Regretting the necessity of employing a phrase which is
<br/>not only borrowed, but redolent of affectation, we still have
<br/>the most earnest sympathy in all the hopes, and the firmest
<br/>faith in the capabilities of “ Young America.” We look upon
<br/>its interests as our own, and shall uniformally uphold them in
<br/>this Journal. What these interests are—what should be the
<br/>aspirations of the new men of the country, and of the country
<br/>through them in especial, it has been our intention to express
<br/>fully in our own words, at the first convenient opportunity—but
<br/>we have now lying before us an address which embodies all
<br/>that there is any necessity for saying.</p>
         <p>We allude to a paper read by Mr. Cornelius Mathews
<br/>at the late annual meeting of the Eucleian Society of the
<br/>University of New York. We shall be pardoned for making
<br/>some extracts:</p>
         <p>I do take it for granted, Gentlemen, that there are some new in-
<br/>fluences to be represented in Literature by the authors of this coun-
<br/>try. I am foolish enough to believe and insist that we are a pro-
<br/>vince to no other country on the face of the world. I therefore, in<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page27"/>
behalf of this young America of ours, insist on nationality and true
<br/>Americanism in the books this country furnishes to itself and to the
<br/>world : nationality in its purest, highest, broadest sense. Not such
<br/>as is proclaimed in taverns, ranted of in Congress, or made the occa-
<br/>sion of boasting and self-laudation on public anniversaries. It need
<br/>not (though it may ) speak of the Revolution—nor Washington—nor
<br/>the declaration of independence—nor Plymouth Rock—nor Bunker
<br/>Hill, Nor Bunker Mill Monument. And yet it may be instinct with
<br/>the life of the country, full of a hearty, spontaneous, genuine home
<br/>feeling; relishing of the soil and of the spirit of the people. It will
<br/>not be petty, I can assure you: in poetry, the echo of effete and
<br/>by-gone English schools, nor in history, the re-production of French
<br/>rhetoric, nor in humor, the popular authors of the time in another
<br/>country. It will not, in a word, grow cross-eyed with straining its
<br/>vision on models, three thousand miles away, while it makes a show
<br/>of busying itself with a subject spread on the desk before it. If I
<br/>read aright, the journals and periodicals of this country begin to
<br/>indicate a weariness of the petty standards, by which they have
<br/>been accustomed to measure and adjudge books of home production :
<br/>to be dissatisfied with the mere elegance in writing which has been
<br/>the prevailing demand and fashion of our literature. They feel that
<br/>here is a giant speaking in a piping treble, and dancing a child’s
<br/>hornpipe, to the universal contempt and mockery of the world.
<br/>The writings of a great country should sound of the great voices
<br/>of nature of which she is full. The march of a great people in
<br/>literature should be majestic and assured as the action of their in-
<br/>stitution is calm and secure. The discovery begins to be made that
<br/>the life of a young Continent is not to be represented, nor its heart
<br/>moved, by tinkling rhymers and sketches with sparrow's quills. It
<br/>is not necessary to enter, now, upon causes which have kept us in
<br/>servitude so long to men not worthy of us; nor to show why it is
<br/>that you may wander through whole bodies and collections of (so
<br/>called) American literature, and find no word or verse worthy of the
<br/>nation. The cause (allowing duly for the absence of great indivi-
<br/>dual genius) must at least be general, which produces so constant
<br/>and melancholy a uniformity of result. In the drama the people
<br/>begin to exhibit a like weariness and aversion to the constant itera-
<br/>tion and re-iteration of plays written for another people, another
<br/>state of society, and to speak not unfairly, in many of the true ele-
<br/>ments of manhood and progress, far behind ourselves. That spirit
<br/>which disdains defeat in war, in commerce or in science, cannot
<br/>much longer rest content with an iguominious vassalage in litera-
<br/>ture. The mere growth of the country will burst the bonds, and
<br/>leave it free to re-assume the vigorous step of a country yet in its
<br/>prime. Here in New York, is the seat and strong hold of this
<br/>young power : but, all over the land, day by day, new men are
<br/>emerging into activity: who partake of these desires, who scorn
<br/>and despise the past pettiness of the country, and who are ready to
<br/>sustain any movement towards a better and nobler condition.</p>
         <p>They contend for home-writers, home-writings, and home criti-
<br/>cism: and it is their belief that the world is yet to receive at the
<br/>hands of the authors of America works which it will be willing to
<br/>add to its catalogue of illustrious influences; to Homer and Dante,
<br/>Shakapeare and Milton, and whoever else has laboured in the broad
<br/>bold of human nature building on a base of sure good sense, and
<br/>embracing in a catholic spirit all that is good and of good influence
<br/>in all the world; drawing it home to their native land in a true na-
<br/>tionality, and returning it again to the world that gave it to bless,
<br/>and cheer, and purify all mankind. It is not a vain desire, I hope,
<br/>that we may yet live to see the world waiting the steps of authors,
<br/>of our own, watching the motions of their spirit, and hanging on the
<br/>birth of their labors : as of men who make a part of their daily
<br/>pleasure and happiness, as they do now of ours.</p>
         <p>And in art, shall we not have schools of our own ? Partaking of
<br/>the climate, the rocks, the woodlands, the rivers and the human
<br/>faces of our own country ? Chosen from what ever region of the
<br/>world the subjects may he, will there not be something in the
<br/>form and spirit, in the skill and kind of execution, to inform us that
<br/>their origin is in the American heart and the American genius ? I
<br/>Would not here, any more than in the writing of books, restrict the
<br/>artist to parallels of latitude and longitude ; nor insist that his sub-
<br/>jects be American, even in name. But what am I to think of a
<br/>country whose very caricatures—the little pieces illustrative of the
<br/>great national incident of the election of a President—are made up
<br/>from the odds and ends of English designers : as though we were
<br/>made thankful for the crumbs and ends of dry crust that drop from
<br/>the table of a master and superior. A stranger visiting us might
<br/>argue against our character, with almost irresistible success, from
<br/>that single circumstance. A people whose mirth—in a question
<br/>where all are ready to think for themselves, and laugh for them-
<br/>selves, one would suppose,—is the charity gift of foreigners. There
<br/>is room and occasion—no more room, no better occasion, any
<br/>where in the world—for a school of comic design, here in New
<br/>York, which shall be truly national, characteristic, and emi-
<br/>nently successful. I have not yet had the good fortune to en-
<br/>counter a single person capable of a respectable performance in this
<br/>way although I am told there are such.</p>
         <p>In sculpture, and some departments of painting, we have already
    <br/>accomplished something in the true spirit of Young America, and<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>the world is ready to acknowledge it. But in another province of
<br/>art, that of engraving,, we have played the copyist and servant with a
<br/>vengeance. For fifty years, at least, I take it, the whole force of
<br/>engravers of the United States has been employed in the dilligent
<br/>imitation and copying and re-production of worn-out and cast-off
<br/>plates of France and England. There are a few examples of cred-
<br/>itable effort annually ; but the eye for the long intervals between,
<br/>is pained and wounded by the saddest parodies and extravaganzas,
<br/>in steel, and copper, and wood. And in music are we never to have
<br/>melodies that shall fix us with links, invisible, yet stronger than
<br/>steel, to our native land; whose sounds swelling over the sea as
<br/>we draw near, or chaunted in far lands, away from home, or sound-
<br/>ing here at our own firesides, shall awaken in us every tender, and
<br/>pleasing, remembrance of this dear country that is ours? You see
<br/>the spirit of what I am attempting to enforce? The business of
<br/>Young America in this regard, is then, as I understand it, to nourish,
<br/>and encourage, and sustain, by a harmonious combination of all the
<br/>true young influences, the manly young writers of the country:</p>
         <p>A Home Literature, national, vigorous, of the soil and the spirit
<br/>of the people : and a popular press, ready to sustain it and itself, by
<br/>showing that it is worthy to form the guide and the friend of the
<br/>country, through which, and to which, it speaks ;</p>
         <p>National Drama, free of the conventionalities, abuses, and false
<br/>usages of the stages of the old world ; a drama, which all Americans
<br/>of all classes, without distinction of sect or party, may attend not
<br/>only without wound or dishonor, but to be moved, and made proud
<br/>and glad by pictures and appeals true to their own experience, and
<br/>to that which they, as Americans, desire and long for;</p>
         <p>Schools of Art in Portraiture, Humor, History-Painting, Sculp-
<br/>ture, Music, which shall grow like these out of the national spirit,
<br/>elevating and enlivening our daily life : making mirth,and similitude,
<br/>and enduring forms of that which we know to be true, and worthy,
<br/>and our own.</p>
         <p>And to further these objects : to bring on their accomplishment
<br/>speedily and happily, let me counsel perfect union and harmony
<br/>among this young brotherhood ; let every writer and every man
<br/>having an influence in art and literature, look upon his fellow-la-
<br/>borer as his brother. Let him insist that he shall be respected, and
<br/>that his labor be worthily rewarded. Let such as are the auxilia-
<br/>ries of literature and art, be given to understand that the writer and
<br/>the artist is something in the nature of a Principal in transactions
<br/>relating to his craft, and that he will and must he dealt with as
<br/>such. Let him demand his station among men, and let men know
<br/>that, one of the ruling powers of the world, will not have his wea-
<br/>pon of authority made, when out of actual service, a scourge for
<br/>his degradation and overthrow.</p>
         <p>United, the authors and artists of America, the unelected, but self-
<br/>sustained governors of a free people, will be the noblest body, the
<br/>manliest phalanx that walks the earth ; at the head of a movement,
<br/>to whose march the whole world will, ere long, be beating joyful
<br/>time.</p>

            <div class="head">Wiley and Putnam s Library of Choice Reading. No. XIII.
The Age of Elizabeth. By William Hazlitt.</div>
            <p>We cannot help regarding the thorough success of Wiley
<br/>and Putnam’s Library of Choice Reading, as the harbinger
<br/>of a better day for the interest of American Letters. It has
<br/>at length been fairly shown, that not only our educated
<br/>classes, but our public at large, will purchase, and have ca-
<br/>pacity to enjoy, a kind of books immeasurably superior, in all
<br/>that renders a book valuable, to the species of literature
<br/>with which we have been latterly deluged.</p>
            <p>The experiment of fine paper, well-sized type, and a taste-
<br/>ful form of getting up generally, has been attempted, and
<br/>not in vain. The day of “cheap literature” is, we thank
<br/>Heaven, happily over; and for this much-desired result it is
<br/>difficult to say how much we are indebted, or rather how
<br/>much we are not indebted, to the liberality and good judg-
<br/>ment of Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam. To have failed in this
<br/>enterprise would have been to throw us back for several years
<br/>into the quagmire of the yellow-backed pamphleteering. Of
<br/>course a great deal depended upon the tact with which books
<br/>for the series were selected. There was a juste milieu to be
<br/>attained—a happy medium between the stilted and jejune
    <br/>—between the ponderous and the ephemeral. Works were
    <br/>required of a piquancy to render them at once popular, (for
<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/> 
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page28"/>
               <br/>the immediate and extensive sale of the Library was indis-
<br/>pensible) and at the same time, of a gravity which would en-
<br/>able them to make their way as volumes not only sufficient
<br/>ly well gotten up, but of a sufficiently standard character to
<br/>warrant their preservation in our book-cases. This difficult
<br/>task fell into the best hands; and the result has been one
<br/>whose importance to the present interest of literature in
<br/>America, can scarcely be overrated. Booksellers in this
<br/>country have a trick of as implicitly following a good lead,
<br/>as did les moutons de Panurge, and we fancy that we al-
<br/>ready perceive, in all quarters, a disposition to prosecute the
<br/>good work of readable books, so auspiciously commenced.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the very best, although not the last volume, of the
<br/>European series, is No. XIII—“ Lectures on the Dramatic
<br/>Literature of the Age of Elizabeth, by William Hazlitt."</p>
            <p>It is indeed a rich work. We cannot, to be sure, agree
<br/>with some of its author’s admirers, in calling him “ The best
<br/>critic which England has produced in the nineteenth cen-
<br/>tury,” for in almost every point, except the vivida vis of glow-
<br/>ing fancy, we look upon him as the inferior of Macaulay—a
<br/>man who, if he has not written the best criticisms ever penn-
<br/>ed, has at least shown the capacity to write them ;—but
<br/>we would rank him next to Macaulay, and very far before
<br/>Leigh Hunt, who was a dexterous but unanalytical, and some-
<br/>what confused prosodist—or Charles Lamb, who thought
<br/>brilliantly, and never troubled himself with thinking if he
<br/>thought to any purpose—or Wilson who always considered
<br/>himself most honest when he was the fullest of prejudice,
<br/>and who had cultivated rhodomontade into a passion. Of
<br/>Jeffrey and Gifford we say nothing—for between these men
<br/>and Hazlitt there are no points of approximation and they
<br/>cannot be compared.</p>
            <p>The criticisms of the latter are, we think, his best compo-
<br/>sitions :—his best book is “The Age of Elizabeth.” Upon
<br/>the whole he is singularly vivid, forceful, acute, discrimina-
<br/>tive, and suggestive. His honesty is wonderful in an age of
<br/>dishonesty. His courage is very well as things go. His
<br/>judgment is never for one moment to be depended upon in
<br/>any connected or consecutive series of opinions. He is often
<br/>profound—but his profundity is invariably detailed or parti-
<br/>cular.</p>
            <p>We quote a few highly characteristic passages from his
    disquisition on the Get man Drama :</p>
            <p>“ I have half trifled with this subject: and I believe I have done so
<br/>because I despaired of finding language for some old rooted feelings
<br/>I have about it, which a theory could never give nor can it take
<br/>away. ‘ The Robbers’ was the first play I ever read : and the ef-
<br/>fect produced upon me was the greatest. It stunned me like a
<br/>blow, and I have not recovered enough from it to describe how it
<br/>was. There are impressions which neither time nor circumstances
<br/>can efface. Were I to live much longer thau I have any chance of
<br/>doing, the books which I rend when I wus young I can never for-
<br/>get. Twenty years have elapsed since I first read a translation of
<br/>‘ The Robbers,' but they have not blotted the impression from my
<br/>mind : it is here still, an old dweller in the chambers of the brain.
<br/>The scene in particular in which Moor looks through his tears at
<br/>the evening sun from the mountain’s brow, and says in his despair,
<br/>“ It was my wish like him to live, like him to die: it was au idle
<br/>thought, a boy's conceit,' took last hold of my imagination, and that
<br/>sun has to me never set! The last interview in ‘ Don Carlos' be-
<br/>tween the two lovers, in which the injured bride struggles to burst
<br/>the prison-house of her destiny, in which her hopes and youth lie
<br/>confined, and buried, as it were, alive, under the opposition of un-
<br/>speakable anguish, I remember gave me a deep sense of suffering
<br/>and a strong desire after good, which has haunted me ever since.
<br/>I do not like Schiller’s late style so well. His ' Wallenstein,’
<br/>which is admirably and almost literally translated by Mr. Cole-
<br/>ridge, is stately, thoughtful, and imaginative: bnt where is the en-
<br/>thusiasm, the throbbing of hope and fear, the mortal struggle be-
<br/>tween the passions: as if all happiness or misery of a life were
<br/>crowded into a moment, and the die was to be cast at that instant ?
<br/>Gotzebue’s best work I read first in Cumberland's imitation of it in
<br/>The Wheel of Fortune,’ and I confess that that style of sentiment
  <br/>which seems to make of life itself a long-drawn endless sigh, has<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>
  something in it that pleases me, in spite of rules and criticism.
<br/>Goethe's tragedies are (those that I have seen of them, his ' Count
<br/>Edmont,' ‘ Stella, ’&amp;c.) constructed upon the second or diverted man-
<br/>ner of the German stage, with a deliberate design to avoid all pos-
<br/>sible effect and interest, and this object is completely accomplished.
<br/>He is however spoken of with enthusiasm almost amounting to
<br/>idolatry by his countrymen, and those among ourselves who import
<br/>heavy German criticism into this country in shallow, flat-bottomed
<br/>unwieldy intellects. Madame de Stael speaks of one passage in
<br/>his ‘ Iphigenia,’ where he introduces a fragment of an old song,
<br/>which the Furies are supposed to sing to Tantalus in Hell, reproach-
<br/>ing him with the times when he sat with the Gods at their golden
<br/>tables, and with his after-crimes that hurled him from heaven, at
<br/>which he turns his eyes from his children and hangs his head in
<br/>mournful silence. This is the true sublime. Of all his works I
<br/>I like his ' Werter' best, nor would I part with it at a venture, even
<br/>for the ‘ Memoirs of Anastasius the Greek,’ whoever is the author;
<br/>nor ever cease to think of the times, “ when in the fine summer
<br/>evenings they saw the frank, noble-minded enthusiast coming up
<br/>from the valley,” nor of “ the high grass that by the light of the
<br/>departing sun waved in the breeze over his grave.”</p>

<br/>tions are needed for the training of the organs, and the culti-
<br/>vation of the voice.” We have looked through the work
<br/>with great interest, and believe it to be the best American
<br/>treatise on the subject discussed. There are some passages,
<br/>(relating chiefly to metre), with which we totally disagree,
<br/>and of which we may take an opportunity of speaking more
<br/>fully hereafter—but in general the book appears to us re-
<br/>markably accurate and valuable. The elocutionary abilities
<br/>of Mr. Murdoch arc of a high order. We rejoice to learn
<br/>that be is about returning to the stage.</p>

         <div class="head">The Drama.</div>
         <p>Mrs. Mowatt, at Niblo’s, has been the great theatrical
<br/>attraction of the week. She has been very successful, drew
<br/>large and fashionable as well as intellectual audiences, and
<br/>elicited boisterous applause, with much of a kind less equi-
<br/>vocal.</p>
         <p>She has erred, we think, in making this arrangement—
<br/>that is to say, she has somewhat injured the prestige of her
<br/>name, first in appearing at a summer theatre, and secondly
<br/>in appearing again at all after so brief an interval. Mrs.
<br/>Mowatt owes it to herself to maintain a certain dignity ; and,
<br/>although this certain dignity be preposterous, in fact in the
<br/>fiction of the world's view it is all important. A lady so
<br/>well-connected, and so well established in the public eye by
<br/>her literary reputation, could have had no difficulty in coming
<br/>upon the stage in her own fashion, and almost on her own
<br/>terms. The Park, as the place of her debut, was, of course,
<br/>unobjectionable, although in a negative sense. She lost no
<br/>caste by coming out here, but the fact cannot be disputed
<br/>that she would have gained much by first appearing in Lon-
<br/>don, and presenting herself to her countrymen and country-
<br/>women with the eclat of a foreign reputation. We say this,
<br/>with a bitter sense of our national degradation, and subser-
<br/>viency to British opinion:—we say it, moreover, with a con-
<br/>sciousness that Mrs. Mowatt should not have done this thing
<br/>however much it would have furthered her interests.</p>
         <p>On another point she has beyond doubt acted unwisely.
<br/>Mr. Crisp is in many respects an excellent actor, but he is by
<br/>no means of that degree of eminence which we should have
<br/>desired in the supporter of Mrs. Mowatt. With Mr. Forrest
<br/>she would have had advantages which can never be afforded
<br/>her by Mr. Crisp.</p>
         <p>We have no sympathies with the prejudices which would
<br/>entirely have dissuaded Mrs. Mowatt from the stage. There
<br/>is no cant more contemptible than that which habitually de-
<br/>cries the theatrical profession—a profession which, in itself,
<br/>embraces all that can elevate and ennoble, and absolutely
<br/>nothing to degrade. If some—if many—or if even nearly all
<br/>of its members are dissolute, this is an evil arising not from
<br/>the profession itself, but from the unhappy circumstances
<br/>which surround it. With these circumstances Mrs. Mowatt
<br/>has, at present, no concern. With talents, enthusiasm, and
<br/>energy, she will both honor the stage and derive from it ho-
<br/>nor. In the mere name of actress she can surely find nothing
<br/>to dread—nothing, or she would be unworthy of the profes-
<br/>sion—not the profession unworthy her. The theatre is en-
<br/>nobled by its high facilities for the development of genius—
<br/>facilities not afforded elsewhere in equal degree. By the
<br/>spirit of genius, we say, it is ennobled—it is sanctified—be-
<br/>yond the sneer of the foul or the cant of the hypocrite. The
<br/>actor of talent is poor at heart indeed, if he do not look with
<br/>contempt upon the mediocrity even of a king. The writer
<br/>of this article is himself the son of an actress—has invariably
<br/>made it his boast—and no earl was ever prouder of his earl-
<br/>dom than he of his descent from a woman who, although
<br/>well-born, hesitated not to consecrate to the drama her brief
<br/>career of genius and of beauty.</p>
         <p>At Niblo’s, as at the Park, Mrs. Mowatt made her first appear-
    <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>ance as Pauline, in “The Lady of Lyons;” and this is the
<br/>only character she has yet sustained. On the play itself we
<br/>have lately seen some strictures which seem to us unjust.
<br/>We regard it as one of the most successful dramatic efforts of
<br/>modern times. It is popular, and justly so. It could not
<br/> fail to be popular so long as the people have a heart. It
<br/>abounds with sentiments which stir the soul as the sound of
<br/>a trumpet. It proceeds rapidly, and consequentially : the
<br/>interest not for one moment being permitted to flag. Its in-
<br/>cidents are admirably conceived, and wrought into execution
<br/>with great skill. Its dramatis personae throughout, have the
<br/>high merit of being natural, although, except in the case of
<br/>Pauline, there is no marked individuality. She is a creation
<br/>which would have done no dishonor to Shakspeare—and she
<br/>excites in us the most profound emotion. It has been sillily
<br/>objected to her that she is weak, mercenary, and at points
<br/>ignoble. She is—and what then? We are not dealing with
<br/>Clarissa Harlowe. Bulwer wished to paint a woman, and
<br/>has done so. The principal defect of the play lies in the he-
<br/>roine’s consenting to wed Beauseant, while aware of the ex-
<br/>istence and even of the continued love of Claude. As the plot
<br/>runs, there is a question in Pauline’s soul between a compa-
<br/>ratively trivial, because mere worldly, injury to her father,
<br/>and utter ruin and despair inflicted upon her husband. Here
<br/>there should have been not an instant’s hesitation. The au-
<br/>dience have no sympathy with any. Nothing on earth should
<br/>have induced the wife to give up the living Melnotte. Only
<br/>the assurance of his death could have justified her in sacri-
<br/>ficing herself to Beauseant. As it is we hate her for the
<br/>sacrifice. The effect is repulsive—at war with the whole
<br/>genius of the play.</p>
         <p>Of Mrs. Mowatt, and of her acting, we have to speak on-
<br/>ly in terms of enthusiastic admiration. We have never had
<br/>the pleasure of seeing her before—and we presume that there
<br/>are many of our readers who have never seen her. Her
<br/>figure is slight—even fragile—but eminently graceful. Her
<br/>face is a remarkably fine one, and of that precise character
<br/>best adapted to the stage. The forehead is the least prepos-
<br/>sessing feature, although it is by no means an unintellectual
<br/>one. The eyes are grey, brilliant, and expressive, without
<br/>being full. The nose is well formed, with the Roman
<br/>curve, and strongly indicative of energy ; this quality is also
<br/>shown in the prominence of the chin. The mouth is some-
<br/>what large, with brilliant and even teeth, and flexible lips,
<br/>capable of the most effective variations of expression. A
<br/>more radiantly beautiful smile we never remember having
<br/>seen. Mrs. Mowatt has also the personal advantage of a
<br/>profusion of rich auburn hair.</p>
         <p>Her manner on the stage is distinguished by an ease and
<br/>self-possession which would do credit to a veteran. Her
<br/>step is very graceful and assured—indeed all her movements
<br/>evince the practised elocutionist. We watched her with the
<br/>closest scrutiny throughout the whole play, and not for one
<br/> instant did we observe her in an attitude of the least awk-
<br/>wardness, or even constraint, while many of her seemingly
<br/>impulsive gestures spoke in loud terms of the woman of ge-
<br/>nius—of the poet deeply imbued with the truest sentiment of
<br/>the beauty of motion.</p>
         <p>Her voice is rich and voluminous, and although by no
<br/>means powerful, is so well managed as to seem so. Her ut-
<br/>terance is singularly distinct—its sole blemish being an oc-
<br/>casional Anglicism of accent, adopted probably from her in-
<br/>structor. Her reading could scarcely be improved. In this
<br/>respect no actress in America is her equal—for she reads not
<br/>theatrically, but with the emphasis of Nature. Indeed the
<br/>great charm of the whole acting of Mrs. Mowatt is its natu-
    <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/> 
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page30"/>
            <br/>ralness. She moves, looks, and speaks with a well-control-
<br/>led impulsiveness as can be conceived from the customary
<br/>rant and cant—the hack conventionality of the stage. If she
<br/>does not suffer herself to be badgered out of this good path
<br/>it will lead her inevitably to the highest distinction—a very
<br/>proud triumph will assuredly be hers.</p>
         <p>Mr. Crisp makes a respectable Melnotte, but little more.
<br/>His action and general manner in this part, are not we think,
<br/>sufficiently calm. Claude is not so much impetuous and im-
<br/>pulsive, as the man of profound passions and deliberate pur-
<br/>poses. Where he takes the character of the Prince Mr.
<br/>Crisp very improperly makes him assume the coxcombical
<br/>airs of the Count in “ Fashion.” He should be made to
<br/>sneer—but no more. His true dignity should never be left
<br/>out of sight. In light comedy Mr. Crisp is, indeed, a very
<br/>admirable actor.</p>
         <p>At the Park, the French troupe have been very successful,
    and have unquestionably deserved success.</p>
         <p>At Castle Garden, the chief attraction has been the admir- j
<br/>able dancing of Mademoiselle Desjardins. Since Elisler we
<br/>have had no one more graceful.</p>
         <p>The Chatam Street and the New Bowery are both, we be-
<br/>lieve doing well. At the latter, Mrs. Flynn (an excellent
<br/>actress) has been winning new laurels in such pieces as
<br/>“ Perfection” and “ The Four Sisters.”</p>
         <p>Mr. Flynn’s new theatre at Richmond Hill will be opened
<br/>in a few weeks. It will be large and airy, accommodating a
<br/>more numerous audience, perhaps, than did the Old Bowery.</p>

         <div>
            <div class="head">An Apology for Church Music and Musical Festivals, by
Edward Hodges, Mus. Doct. of Sidney Sussex College.
Cambridge.</div>
            <p>The subject of the remarks which we propose to present
<br/>to our readers, is one of paramount importance to the profess-
<br/>ors, and to the cause of music. There is ever a host of ene-
<br/>mies ready to fall open-mouthed upon music and upon all re-
<br/>lating to it, and more particularly is church music open to
<br/>bitter and bigoted persecution, from men of all sects, more
<br/>especially among the clergymen. Some of them probably
<br/>are wroth at being compelled to shorten their sermons, in
<br/>consequence of music lengthening the service; others, per-
<br/>fectly conscious of the eloquence and beauty of their dis-
<br/>courses, feel afraid that the music should draw off some of
<br/>the admiration due to them. There are also, doubtless, some
<br/>who conscientiously believe music an ungodly science, be-
<br/>cause sinners and other profane people sing and play, and
<br/>others who think that the money paid to singers and organ-
<br/>ists could be used to much better advantage if placed at their,
<br/>disposal. But we will leave to Dr. Hodges the defence of;
<br/>church Music, being perfectly satisfied that there is no other
<br/>man in this country so fully capable of handling the subject.</p>
            <p>The remarks, of which we give a portion this week, were
<br/>furnished us by the kindness of the author, and were written
<br/>by him some years since, in answer to certain papers in
<br/>which the propriety of refusing to allow the performance of
<br/>the London Grand Musical Festival, to take place in West-
<br/>minster Abbey, was powerfully argued.</p>
            <p>How ably and triumphantly Dr. Hodges advocated the
    <br/>cause of church music will be seen in our future numbers.
</p>
            <p>We shall give the remarks nearly entire, for we are sure
<br/>that the elegance and force of the writer's style, the unan-
<br/>swerable truth of the arguments he advances, and the great
<br/>authorities he quotes in his support, will prove all sufficient,
  <br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/>to recommend the papers to the earnest attention of cur rea-
  <br/>ders.
</p>
            <p> There is no science, human or divine, of such universal acepta-
<br/>tion among mankind, as that no man can be found to impugn its
<br/> pretensions. In this age of subversion, therefore, wherein all relig-
<br/>ion is denounced as priestcraft, and civil government as tyranny, we
<br/> are not to wonder that music also should have its adversaries. And
<br/> yet, if in the whole range of human contemplation, there be any
<br/> one thing which would seem less likely than all others to stir up
<br/>strife and contention, that subject is the science of sweet sounds.
<br/>Man, in all ages, from the infancy of the world to the present day,
<br/>has recognized its power, and bowed to its influence. In every
<br/>clime from the frigid regions about the poles, to the burning plains
<br/>of the torrid zone, music has been appealed to as the laborum dulce
<br/>lenimen, the joy of buoyant youth, the solace of declining age.
<br/> Practised by saints and angels, lauded by sage philosophers, encour-
<br/> aged by grave legislators, and sanctioned not only by the usage of
<br/>time but by almost an identification with the most solemn offices
<br/> of our most holy religien, it has come down to us to be aspersed and
<br/> vilified in this our day as a pursuit utterly unworthy of an intellec-
<br/>tual being, and in its noblest exhibitions to be stigmatized as a pro-
<br/>fanation of our ecclesiastical edifices.</p>
            <p>Now although nothing has been recently alleged against church
<br/>music, which has not been adduced and triumphantly refuted, again
<br/>and again, in past times ; yet forasmuch as it is possible that some
<br/> persons may be carried away by the specious plausibility with
<br/>which old sophistries have been tricked out, I have thought it not
<br/>amiss, in the absence of a better champion, to attempt a brief reply
<br/> to what modern gainsayers continue so pertinaciously to advance.
<br/>This is the more necessary inasmuch as the opposition at present is
<br/>principally conducted by two most respectable public prints, viz.
<br/>the Standard, which may be considered as the organ of the high-
<br/>church section of Toryism, and the Record, which may with equal
<br/>truth be deemed the representative of the opinions of the so-called
<br/>Evangelical party in the establishment. Had the “ railing accusa-
<br/>tion’’ been confined to that portion of the public press which trades
<br/>in sedition and revels in the imaginary perspective of the progres-
<br/>sive destruction of all our venerable institutions, civil as well as sa-
<br/>cred, the reproach might have been borne with honor, and suffered
<br/>to pass unheeded as the idle snail which leaves its slimy track upon
<br/>the village steeple. Every Christian musician [and I trust there
<br/>are many such] feels on the occasion with David, the man after
<br/> God’s own heart, and yet the most musical king the world ever
<br/>saw, when he bemoans himself in Psalm LV., “ For it was not an
<br/>enemy that reproached me, then I could have borne it; neither
<br/> was it he that hated me, that did magnify himself against me, then
<br/>I would have hid myself from him:" a psalm appropriately address-
<br/> ed “ To the chief musician on Neginoth.” Still I should not have
<br/> had recourse to this method of defending the science which I have
<br/> the honor to profess, had not the editor of the Standard refused to
<br/> insert a short communication which I addressed him in reply to some
<br/>of his animadversions; contenting himself in his notice to corres-
<br/>pondents with calling me “an enthusiast,” and informing the pub-
<br/>lic that “ he could not accommodate his conscience to he the means
<br/>of disseminating opinions which he believed to be erroneous,”
<br/>although the latter referred to consisted principally of a statement
<br/>of facts. Although this conduct of the editor would seem to be a
<br/>departure from that straightforward rule of rectitude which I would
<br/>fain believe has been and is generally his actuating principle, I can
<br/>not be very angry with him on the occasion, as it has afforded me
<br/>an opportunity of throwing into a more permanent shape the few
<br/>arguments which I hope shortly to bring forward.</p>
            <p>The Standard from time to time, for many months last past, has
<br/>dropped hints of its antipathy to music. At length it began to speak
<br/>more distinctly, and under date of the 26th March has a passage of
<br/>this sort:</p>
            <p>“ Sensuality of every kind, feasts and festivals, whether culinary or musi-
<br/>cal, for both are alike sensual, ought to be forever excluded from the seats of
<br/>learning and religion.”</p>
            <p>"If the Bishop thinks with us, that the propriety of employing a Church
<br/>as a place of sensual recreation, or as a place lor the collection of money, re-
<br/>ceived in consideration of enjoyment of any kind ; if the Bishop thinks with
<br/>us that the propriety of such an employment of a Church is at best doubtful,
<br/>it is surely not merely his right, but his duty to avoid taking part in the ap-
<br/>proaching festival.”</p>
            <p>“ Our views are altogether practical. Leaving out of view, for the present,
<br/>the higher question, whether the application to seculur uses of things usually
<br/>devoted to the uses of religion be directly sinful or otherwise, we are quite
<br/>sure that it is, consequentially, injurious to the interests of the Church that
<br/>permits it.”</p>
            <p>“ It is almost an instinct, or if it he not an instinct, it must be amongst the
<br/>earliest truths that open to the mind, which teaches that the things of this
<br/>world cannot he permitted to intrude upon the considerations of the next, and
<br/>the services which these last enjoin, without detriment to the purity of relig-
<br/>ious feeling. Nor must we lose sight of the fact, that at the present the
<br/>Church of England is, in the strictest sense of the word a Church militant;
<br/>that she is beset with enemies, by no means scrupulous in their warfure—with
<br/>enemies who could easily enough convert a muster of singers and fiddlers in
<br/>one of her principal temples, with an apparatus of check-takers and door-
<br/>keepers to collect money for hearing these singers and fiddlers, into a very op-
<br/>probitious similitude of a theatrical representation; and, unquestionably, they
<br/>who would so represent a musical festival in a cathedral, would find ready
<br/>hearers amongst the nonmusical part of the world, that is, among nineteen-
<br/>twentieths of the populalion, including ourselves in the unhappy majority.<br/>
               <div class="columnbreak"/> 
               <div class="pagebreak" id="#page31"/>
It is very true, there are those who think that music may be made subservient
<br/>to the cultivation of religion; but it is a doleful truth that there are also
<br/>those, we are persuaded the great majority, if they dare confess it, who feel
<br/>eaen the very small infusion of music usually permitted in our liturgical service,
<br/>an obstruction, rather than an aid to their religious contemplations.	The truth</p>
            <p/>
            <p>of the matter is, the musical faculty not indigenous to our soil. We must
<br/>not fall into the common mistake, that a love of songs is a taste for music,
<br/>even were we a singing people, which we are not. It is merely the gratifica-
<br/>tion which arises from the combination of variety with regularity, as express-
<br/>ed in sounds, the same which we see exhibited in dancing, which adds to
<br/>whatever pleasure is afforded by the words of a song,—but we must not get
<br/>into a metaphysical treatise. Suffice it to say, that as the uninitiated in mu-
<br/>sic do not go to musical festivals for the sake of devotion, so it may reason-
<br/>ably be doubted. that many who do go to such festivals may be classed with
<br/>those who go to church</p>
            <div class="ab">‘ To hear the music there ;'</div>
            <p> 
               <br/>and that many more deceive themselves into the notion that their feelings
  <br/>are religious, when they are little better than animal sensuality.</p>

  <br/>JOHN RONGE,
  <br/>THE HOLY COAT OF TREVES,
  <br/>AND THE NEW GER. CATHOLIC CHURCH.
  <br/>Including authentic details of the events connected with the recent
<br/>exhibition of the pretended " Coat of our Lord ” in the Cathedral of
<br/>Treves, during the months of August and September, 1844 : compris-
<br/>ing the letters and protestations of the author against the imposition
<br/>and superstitions of the Roman Catholic priests, &amp;c.
  <br/>This publication is exceedingly opportune; it will be perused with
<br/>deep interest by the Protestant community at large.—Commercial Ad-
<br/>vertiser.
  <br/>The noble protest of Ronge has been circulated in Germany, not by
<br/>thousands, but by millions of copies ; and it has been hailed with loud
<br/>applause by all classes, because it expeesses a public sentiment, and
<br/>finds a response in all hearts.—New York Observer.

  <br/>A PILGRIMAGE TO TREVES,
  <br/>THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE MEUSE, AND THE FOREST OF
  <br/>ARDENNES.
  <br/>BY CHARLES EDWARD ANTHON, Esq.
  <br/>This is the production of a young American, who had the rare for-
<br/>tune to be present at the most marvellous occurrence of the 19th cen-
<br/>tury—the exhibition of the Holy Robe. In addition to a very graphic
<br/>description of this extraordinary event, which, from the excitement it
<br/>has created, seems destined to be an era in the Christian Church, this
<br/>unpretending volume is replete with antiquarian lore, relating to the
<br/>city of Charlemagne, from which the " Pilgrimage ” commences—
<br/>the intermediate historic and poetic ground ; and of the once renowned
<br/>city of Treves, with which it closes. It is the work of a scholar, and
<br/>cannot fail to enlist a profound interest.—Oswego Advertiser.
  <br/>MR. PRESCOTT’S HISTORICAL WORKS.
  <br/>In 3 volumes 8vo, beautifully printed and accompanied with fine En-

  <br/>HISTORY OF
  <br/>THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO
  <br/>WITH A LIFE OF THE CONQUERER, HERNANDO CORTES,
  <br/>AND A VIEW OF ANCIENT MEXICAN CIVILIZATION.
  <br/>BY WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT, Esq.
  <br/>Mr. Prescott appears to possess almost every qualification for his
<br/>task; he has a pure, simple, and eloquent style—a keen relish for the
<br/>picturesque—a quick and discerning judgment of character, and a calm,
<br/>generous and enlightened spirit of philanthropy, There is no exag-
<br/>geration in stating that his Conquest of Mexico” contains most of the
<br/>valuable qualities which distingush the most popular historical writers
<br/>in our language of the present day. It unites the chivalrous but truth-
<br/>ful enthusiasm of Col. Napier, and the vivacity of the accomplished
<br/>author of the " Siege of Granada,” with the patient and ample research
<br/>of Mr. Tytler.—Edinburgh Review, May, 1845.
  <br/>In 3 volumes 8vo, uniform with the above, with Portraits and Maps.
  <br/>HISTORY OF THE
  <br/>REIGN OF FERDINAND AND ISBAELLA,
  <br/>THE CATHOLIC.
  <br/>BY WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT, Esq.
  <br/>The Tenth Edition.
  <br/>It would be altogether supererogatory to make this celebrated work
<br/>the subject of critical analysis, since it has so long been distinguished
<br/>by the concurrent and enthusiastic applause of the whole reading com-
<br/>munity. We know of scarcely any other work so amusing, instruc-
<br/>tive, and powerfully attractive as the “ History of Ferdinand and Isa-
<br/>bella ;” it possesses every charm which elegance of diction, graceful-
<br/>ness of style, and interest of subject can impart. In a word, it is such
<br/>a production as could only have emanated from a mind richly stored
<br/>with the wealth of sound learning, genius, and the felicitous art of its
<br/>application.—-N. Y. Review.</div>

  <br/>SECOND EDITION.—This valuable work is being
  <br/>introduced into a large number of the best Schools in the City and
  <br/>Country.
  <br/>It only needs to be generally known to become universally estab-
  <br/>lished.
  <br/>Testimonials are received from every quarter.
  <br/>From Rev. R. F. Burnham, Rector of St. Paul's Church, Hoboken.
  <br/>“ Having seen with much pleasure, a second edition, by your house,
<br/>of " A Plain System of Elocution," I beg leave to express to you my
<br/>opinion of the high merit of that work.
  <br/>Its title is in keeping with the plan pursued in the book ; a rare fact
<br/>in this age of making many books. In the work may be found what
<br/>this age needs—a System of Elocution, that presents to the learner
<br/>something tangible; and that combines meaning with beauty, and
<br/>beauty with force.
  <br/>I hereby express the opinion that the Principals of Seminaries of
<br/>Learning would benefit the department of Elocution, by the introduc-
<br/>tion of Mr. Vandenhoff’s System."

  <br/>SIR —WE WILL THANK YOU TO CAUTION
  <br/> the public against a set of imposters who are calling upon our cus-
<br/> tomers, asserting that they are engaged by us in the capacity of agents.
<br/> In several instances they have succeeded in obtaining orders. But
<br/> when the goods are delivered great dissatisfaction has been given by
<br/>the infamous and utterly base imitations. But still persisting that the
<br/> cards are our manufacture, they too often succeed in foisting them
<br/> upon the unsuspecting. We ourselves would strenuously caution the
<br/>said parties that, should they persist after this notice, we will try what
<br/>effect a State Prison will have upon them.

         <div class="ab">BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
         <br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<br/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<br/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<br/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<br/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<br/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<br/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, arc too often
<br/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<br/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<br/>only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<br/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<br/>musicians.
         <br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the
<br/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
<br/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
         <br/>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
<br/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<br/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<br/>of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
<br/>necessary to give a lew of the names in the principal cities.
