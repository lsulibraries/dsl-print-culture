         <div class="head">TWENTIETH ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE ACADEMY
OF NATIONAL DESIGN.</div>
         <p>THE Artists of New York,
<br/>make their appeal to the
<br/>public but once a year;
<br/>eleven months they labor
<br/>in their retired studios—
<br/>unknown but to a select
<br/>few, seeking, like miners
<br/>in the dark, after the
<br/>gems which a thoughtless
<br/>world will regard with
<br/>as much indifference as
<br/>though they were soap
<br/>bubbles which had been
<br/>created by a puff, and like a puff could be meetly rewarded
<br/>Among the innumerable excitements of our busy life, the open-
<br/>ing of the Academy seems but a trivial matter, yet to many
<br/>an ambitious spirit it is the one great event of the year. That
<br/>modest little canvass, bearing upon its surface a remote like-
</p>
         <p>ness of a kitten, a decayed tree, or a red-nosed toper, and
<br/>hung, or rather stuck in a pokerish corner on a level with
<br/>one’s boots, as though spectators carried their eyes in their
<br/>ankles, insignificant as it may appear to you or me, is an ob-
<br/>ject of immense importance to somebody; the corner stone
<br/>of a young artist’s reputation, the point d'appui of his for-
<br/>tunes and happiness; and you may be sure that the obscure
<br/>position in which the merciless "hangers" have placed his
<br/>chef d'œuvre has caused him a cruel palpitation of the heart,
<br/>and not unlikely a flood of tears, and he has promised him-
<br/>self that when he gets to be a “ hanger" he will be sure and
<br/>give all young artists a place on the line. Happy period of
<br/>hopes and disappointments, when there is something to look
<br/>forward to! It is better to be a poor artist with something
<br/>to gain, than a Rafaelle with powers fully developed an no-
<br/>thing more to hope for.</p>
         <p>The first glance at the exhibition, impressed us with an
<br/>idea of its superiority over the exhibition of the last year, and
<br/>a more deliberate survey of the pictures has confirmed the
<br/>impression. There is a smaller number of works than the
<br/>exhibition of last year contained, and consequently there are
<br/>fewer bad pictures; we understand that there were some
<br/>paintings rejected, and every sincere friend of Art will regret
<br/>that the committee bad not rejected “ some more." It is no
<br/>disgrace to an artist to paint a poor picture, but it is a dis-
<br/>grace to an institution like the National Academy, which
<br/>assumes the responsible duty of fostering and encouraging
<br/>Art, to exhibit pictures to the public, which have no artis-
<br/>tic merit of any kind. It is a mistaken kindness to an
<br/>artist to exhibit one of his works that will bring him into
<br/>contempt; it will be better that he remain unknown,
<br/>than known unfavorably ; his crude works, which may appear
<br/>respectably in his own room, when hung by the side of a<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>finished performance will appear very bad. The hanging
<br/>committee have an extremely delicate duty, and it is easy
<br/>to understand the difficulty of rejecting the work of a per-
<br/>sonal friend or of an associate, but their duty to the cause of
<br/>Art, and even to the individual himself, should outweigh
<br/>every other consideration, and no amiable feelings should be
<br/>allowed to avert the decisions of an honest judgment. Every
<br/>visiter to the exhibition will feel that the committee of ar-
<br/>rangement have done themselves—the cause of Art, and one
<br/>of their own members, a grievous wrong, by the admission
<br/>of the landscape numbered 28 on the catalogue. We do not
<br/>believe that any member of the Academy, excepting the one
<br/>who painted it, will say that this picture is worthy of a place
<br/>in the exhibition, and every body will feel that it will do the
<br/>artist whose name it bears a positive harm; yet it is given a
<br/>post of honor, and two of the very best paintings in the
<br/>exhibition are hung so high that their real merits cannot
<br/>be discovered. There are other paintings in the exhibition
<br/>which should have been excluded, but none so obtrusive as
<br/>this, or by artists who write N. A. at the end of their names.
<br/>We have heard a very good reason given for hanging this
<br/>picture.—The artist committed murder, and therefore was
<br/>hung; to which we agree, but then he should have been
<br/>hung out of sight: the law of the state says that no criminal
<br/>shall be hung in public.</p>
         <p> The exhibition consists of 369 works of Art, contributed
<br/>by 145 artists, of whom four are foreigners. There are 152
<br/>portraits, about thirty miniatures, ninety-seven landscapes,
<br/>fifteen historical compositions, ten or twelve water-color
<br/>drawings, five pen and ink sketches, two pieces of sculp-
<br/>ture, one architectural design, and five foreign engravings,
<br/>which we do not see the propriety of hanging in an exhibi-
<br/>tion of original pictures.</p>
         <p>We are very happy to see that the best portraits in the
<br/>exhibition are contributed by young artists, hitherto unknown,
<br/>who are neither academicians nor associates, for it is to our
<br/>young artists that we must look for honorable distinction in
<br/>the world of Art; and though in landscape the meed of excel-
<br/>lence must still be awarded to Cole and Durand, and in works
<br/>of humor, to Mount and Edmonds, there are others, particu-
<br/>larly in landscape, who are found treading upon their heels,
<br/>and who will very soon be dividing honors with them. We
<br/>begin our remarks at the beginning of the catalogue, for the
<br/>sake of convenience.</p>
         <p>No. 1. Death of Abel—C. Mayr, A. There are many
<br/>good points in this picture, although the general effect of it
<br/>is unpleasant. The subject is both hackneyed and impres-
<br/>sive and it would be impossible to handle it without repeat-
<br/>ing somebody’s ideas. The first murder is a solemn theme,
<br/>and it should be so handled as to leave no trifling impressions
<br/>on the mind of the spectator, but to do so requires talents
<br/>which Mr. Mayr evidently lacks. It is truly a melancholy
<br/>sight to see so much ability, and so much time and good ma-
<br/>terials, employed all to no purpose. What perfect works
<br/>should we not see if every man could know what he was<div class="pagebreak" id="#page258"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>best calculated to perform! The merest tyro could tell Mr.
<br/>Mayr that the head of his Adam is a good deal too small,
<br/>that Eve is a good deal too young, that Abel lies as flat upon
<br/>the ground as a board, and that the pointer, though very
<br/>well painted, detracts from the solemnity of the subject. Full
<br/>sized naked figures do not show to good advantage in a room
<br/>as small as that of the National Academy.</p>
         <p>No. 6. Portrait of Calvin Gitteau.—S. Thayer, Syracuse.
<br/>As the work of a young artist, this portrait possesses conside-
<br/>rable merit. Though by no means a very agreeable picture,
<br/>it is truthful and modest, and very evidently a good likeness
<br/>of the original.</p>
         <p>No. 7. Portrait of a Lady—by A. H. Wenzler. We re-
<br/>gard this picture as the best portrait in the exhibition. There
<br/>is a leaden tone which pervades it that is far from pleasant(
<br/>but taken altogether as to drawing, color, and expression, we
<br/>have seen nothing there that can be placed beside it. This,
<br/>and the other portraits by the same hand in the exhibition,
<br/>must give the artist a high position in his profession.</p>
         <p>No. 8. Red Jacket's Descendants—W. J. Wilgus, Buffalo.
<br/>The portraits of an Indian woman and her child, are well co-
<br/>lored, and well drawn, but it is not easy to judge of an artist's
<br/>ability, in portraiture, from such subjects as this. The only
<br/>portraits that we have seen by Mr. Wilgus were of Indians;
<br/>he has an “ H ” at the end of his name, and we believe he
<br/>enjoys a high reputation at the west as a portrait painter.</p>
         <p> No. 10. Italy in the Olden time—T. Rossiter, A. This
<br/>picture is well called after the olden time, for it resembles
<br/>nothing that the moderns have ever seen. If paintings like
<br/>this, are the legitimate fruits of a residence in Italy, they
<br/>should be a caution to our young artists who are longing to
<br/>go abroad, to remain at home, and be content with Nature.</p>
         <p>No. 11. Portrait—by H. Peters Gray, N. A. As a color-
<br/>ist, Mr. Gray undoubtedly stands at the head of the contri-
<br/>butors to the present exhibition, but his portraits lack other
<br/>qualities which are more essential in a picture than color;
<br/>he has taste and fancy in a high degree, but the chief essen-
<br/>tial of a portrait, correct drawing, is often wanting in his
<br/>performances. This portrait bears sufficient resemblance to
<br/>the original to enable his acquaintances to see for whom it
<br/>is intended, but the head is exceedingly ill drawn, or the
<br/>position in which he stands is a very bad one.</p>
         <p>No. 12. Portrait of a Gentleman—W. Swain, A. This is
<br/>the portrait of Mr. Casilear, an artist of fine abilities, who
<br/>seems to have a strange reluctance to show his performances
<br/>to the public. Mr. Swain has succeeded belter in this pic-
<br/>ture than in any other that we have seen from his easel.—
<br/>No. 43, A Portrait of Dr. Milnor, by the same artist, is a
<br/>good likeness, but it is not equal in artistic merit to this of
<br/>Mr. Casilear.</p>
         <p>No. 3. The Discovery—by L. P. Clover, A. A small cabi-
<br/>net painting, representing a lady in a library, reading a let-
<br/>ter ; a cavalier is looking over her shoulder, who probably
<br/>discovers something, which gives a title to the picture.
<br/>Through the open door is seen a life size copy of a group,
<br/>from the Antique, Cupid and Psyche. Last year the hanging
<br/>committee rejected a painting by an academician for contain-
<br/>ing the same figures, infinitely better painted. There is a
<br/>globe in one comer of the picture, which is well done; it is
<br/>the only point in the composition upon which we can bestow
<br/>much commendation. We must confess to a hearty dislike
<br/>of these masquerade subjects, they are out of place every
<br/>where excepting in a lady's magazine, and even there they
<br/>would be out of place if we did not expect to see them as a
<br/>matter of course. It is impossible that they should embody<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>an idea that will prove either profitable or pleasing to any
<br/>body, and we cannot but wonder that an artist should throw
<br/>away his time in producing such inanities, while the world
<br/>is full of sober realities, whose shadows even appeal forcibly
<br/>to the heart. Some of Mr. Clover’s earlier sketches seemed
<br/>to indicate a love of nature which he must have entirely
<br/>lost. The “Discovery” is a bad picture of a very bad
<br/>school.</p>
         <p>No. 13. Portrait of C. H. Marshall—by C. C. Ingham. N.
<br/>A. Mr. Ingham is probably one of the best painters of silks
<br/>and velvets in the world ; and if ladies had porcelain necks
<br/>and coral lips, he would be equally as good a painter of de-
<br/>licate women; but flesh is a substance that he has never
<br/>looked at with a view of giving a resemblance to it on his
<br/>canvas. The subject of this portrait is one of the bluffest
<br/>looking men in New York, but we should never suspect it
<br/>from the picture before us. It is carefully and elaborately
<br/>painted, but still leaves an impression on the mind of a want
<br/>of finish. A picture may be elaborated to the last extreme,
<br/>and still appear unfinished—because there will be something
<br/>wanted. Mr. Ingham’s portraits are admirably adapted to
<br/>the tastes of a certain class, fortunately a large one, who
<br/>have the means, and are generally willing to pay liberally
<br/>for their gratification. While there is a passion for fine fur-
<br/>niture and fine dresses, he will never lack for sitters; and it
<br/>is well that there are all kinds of artists, that no tastes may
<br/>be left ungratified. His portraits will be invaluable a centu-
<br/>ry or two hence to the student in costumery.</p>

     <div>
         <div class="head">PUBLIC DISASTERS.</div>
         <p>The public press, and the public voice during the last fort-
<br/>night, have been mainly occupied in discussing the particu-
<br/>lars of the two great disasters which happened so close toge-
<br/>ther :—the wreck of the Swallow, and the fire at Pittsburgh.
<br/>The rumors of a Mexican War were flying about all the
<br/>while; but though the truth of such rumors would prove
<br/>the greatest disaster that the country has experienced in
<br/>thirty years, yet they had no power to divert people from the
<br/>discussion of a calamity of actual occurrence. Every wonder
<br/>must live its nine days, and it is a subject of regret that some
<br/>wonders do not live much longer.</p>
         <p>There seems to be a general disposition in the public mind
<br/>to fix the blame of a disaster like that of the Swallow upon
<br/>some particular individual, and we perceive that the Grand
<br/>Jury have presented the pilot of that unfortunate boat for
<br/>manslaughter. But we do not believe that any body enter-
<br/>tains a serious thought that such a charge can be sustained.
<br/>It is very possible, in this case of the Swallow, that nobody
<br/>is to blame but the community at large. If the boat had
<br/>been properly constructed, not a life would have been lost.
<br/>But it is the fashion to build steam-boats like birch canoes to
<br/>satisfy the public craving for rapid travelling, and it must be
<br/>evideut that a boat one-sixteenth of a mile in length and
<br/>only thirty feet in breadth, would break in two whenever one
<br/>end of her should be suspended out of the water. It is true
<br/>that the chances of such a thing happening on the Hudson
<br/>river are very few, but those few should have been guarded
<br/>against. The boats on the river should either have been dif-
<br/>ferently constructed, or the rock upon which the Swallow
<br/>struck should have had a beacon placed upon it; and if there
<br/>are any other places of similar danger in the river, they
<br/>should have beacons placed upon them without delay.—
<br/>There may have been very gross carelessness on the part of
<br/>the pilot of the Swallow, but there will always be careless-
<br/>ness on the part of other pilots; it is quite impossible to
<br/>guard against it wholly, and the safer way will be to put it<div class="pagebreak" id="#page259"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>out of the power of carelessness or inefficiency to destroy life
<br/>and property, by erecting all suitable safeguards before we
<br/>expose ourselves to danger. The public demand swift ve-
<br/>hicles when they travel: they must, therefore, be content to
<br/>pocket such accidents as are consequent upon their rapid
<br/>manner of travelling. If one of the old-fashioned slow-going
<br/>boats had been in the place of the Swallow, she would have
<br/>lain there very comfortably without straining a limb or wet-
<br/>ting a passenger. We do not condemn rapid travelling, but
<br/>we condemn the disposition of people not to rest content with
<br/>the inevitable consequences of their own system.</p>
           <p> The great fire in Pittsburgh by which millions of property
<br/>have been destroyed, was owing entirely to a miserable idea
<br/>of economy, which led the people of that city to construct
<br/>their houses in such a manner as to invite a general confla-
<br/>gration. A very little extra expense in the construction of
<br/>their houses, would have saved them from the terrible cala-
<br/>mity which has nearly overwhelmed them. We marvel at
<br/>people who build cities in the neighborhood of a volcano,
<br/>which may at any moment bury them under a shower of
<br/>lava; yet we build our cities of the most inflammable mate-
<br/>rials, neglect to provide the proper means for extinguish-
<br/>ing a conflagration, and when destruction is upon us stand
<br/>aghast for a moment, and then go rapidly to work recon-
<br/>structing our houses of the same perishable materials, and
<br/>filling them with our most costly goods. A few thousand
<br/>dollars would have saved New York in 1835 from the disas-
<br/>trous fire from which she has not yet recovered. Such ano-
<br/>ther cannot probably ever occur in this city again; we build
<br/>our houses of better materials and in a better manner; and
<br/>we have greatly increased our means of extinguishing fires
<br/>by the introduction of the Croton into our streets, but our
<br/>neighbor, Brooklyn, only requires a torch to be applied to
<br/>one of her tinder houses during a dry north-wester, to be laid
<br/>in ruins in a very few hours. They have whole streets of
<br/>slight wooden houses, which could only be saved from burn-
<br/>ing by being pulled down, while their supply of water is ex-
<br/>ceedingly limited. It is owing more to good luck than good
<br/>management that they have not already been reduced to
<br/>ashes.</p>
         <p>Instead of feeling astonishment at the occurrence of an ex-
<br/>tensive conflagration in any of our cities, we should rather be
<br/>amazed at the non-occurrence of such an event.</p>
      </div>
            
      <div>
         <div class="head">BROADWAY.</div>
         <p>Willis calls the Castle Garden “the amputated toe of
<br/>Broadway.” When observing the general arrangement of this
<br/>our Gotham, I always think of Gulliver when he fell asleep
<br/>upon the plains of Lilliput, and the Lilliputians fastened him
<br/>to the ground by his hair. Castle Garden suggests Lemuel’s
<br/>head; the bridge, his neck; Broadway up to the Park, his
<br/>body ; the remainder of Broadway, his left leg; Park Row,
<br/>Chatham street, and the Bowery, represent his right leg;
<br/>two long slips, that stretch out into the East River and the
<br/>Hudson, his arms; the great iron pipes that convey the Cro-
<br/>ton and the Gas, his great arteries; the service-pipes, his
<br/>smaller blood-vessels; and, by the recent establishment of
<br/>Morse's telegraphic wires, the imaginary giant has been fur-
<br/>nished with nerves.</p>
         <p> Let us stand for a moment, on the battlements of Castle
Garden—in other words, on the giant’s forehead.</p>
         <p>What a scene is this! The waters of the Atlantic are at
<br/>our feet. Who knows how far these bright blue waves,
<br/>have rolled to visit us this morning. See how their tiny
<br/>ridges reflect the flying clouds! How gracefully they bear
<br/>up these “ white winged ships”—the angels or messengers
<br/>of our national Commerce—as they enter this noble bay, not
<br/>dealing death and destruction in their path, as in former days,
<br/>but freighted with the productions of many a clime, from the
<br/>iron of northern Russia to the spices of Ceylon! See the <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>leafless forest that surrounds our wharves as if it grew out
<br/>of the water, its culminating points piercing the sky like the
<br/>spears of an army of Titans. You can hear, at this distance,
<br/>the clicking cogs of a hundred windlasses, loading and un-
<br/>loading a hundred ships. Hundreds have recently arrived:
<br/>—hundreds are about to set sail. Owners, captains, consign-
<br/>ers, provision-merchants, passengers and crews are moving
<br/>busily around these masts. Only a low dull murmur reaches
<br/>us here, from their many thousand tongues, and their foot-
<br/>steps on the sounding decks. But most prominent, perhaps,
<br/>among the objects that attract attention, are the little steam-
<br/>ers that ply hither and thither, snorting and choking as they
<br/>paddle along, and giving noisy animation to the scene.
<br/>Steamers of a much larger class, fitted for navigating the
<br/>Sound, and belonging to the Norwich and Stonington lines,
<br/>lie alongside the pier to our right. Around the landing-place,
<br/>the crowd of cabmen is dense. The old “Massachusetts”
<br/>has just arrived. She is letting off her steam; and the loud,
<br/>continuous roar, mingling with the shouts of cabmen, police-
<br/>men, and jackalls from the Hotels, sounds as though King
<br/>Acohis and his subject Eurus were quarrelling at the mouth
<br/>of the storm-cave, while Notus and his other brethren, mem-
<br/>bers of the tempestuous cabinet, complete the hoarse quin-
<br/>tette by exerting their highly effective windpipes. One
<br/>glance more at Staten Island, Governor’s Island, and the
<br/>other two, Bedlow and Gibbet, South Brooklyn and the Jer-
<br/>sey shore—landscape and waterscape together. We must
<br/>be gone. Somebody will be complaining pettishly that all
<br/>this is irrelevant, and that not one word has been said about
<br/>Broadway.</p>
        <p>Let us now walk along the giant’s neck to his collar-bone
<br/>—the farther limit of the Battery-green. His neck, indeed,
<br/>might at first sight appear to be wry : but the truth is, the
<br/>huge ante-diluvian is merely bending his head, listening to
<br/>the music of the sea.</p>
        THE BOWLING GREEN.
<p>The enclosure before us is a strong effort at “ rus in urbe.”
<br/>Although the effort is in some respects a failure, vet it can-
<br/>not be denied that the spot is forcibly suggestive of the olden
<br/>time, when our “ forbears” indulged in the sports of merry
<br/>England and phlegmatic Deutschland. The effect of the
<br/>ledge of rocks and its Croton cascade is decidedly bad. The
<br/>sun has never shone before on such a ledge of rocks as that
<br/>in the Bowling-Green. If it were possible successfully to
<br/>ridicule the true, this work of art might be pronounced a
<br/>burlesque on nature. The beautiful roebuck and it smate
<br/>gaze upon the phenomenon in undisguised amazement; and,
<br/>if the same privilege were extended to them, as a less come-
<br/>ly quadruped enjoyed more than three thousand years ago,
<br/>they would doubtless say that they had never seen the like
<br/>in their native wilds. However, we will not grumble. The
<br/>water is clear and bright, and the grass is green ; and these
<br/>graceful creatures,—now habituated to their narrow limits,
<br/>and their little Gothic hut of arching bows—seem, if we may
<br/>judge by their playfulness, to have quite forgotten their for-
<br/>est-home. The Bowling-Green must be a little paradise to
<br/>those who dwell around it;—refreshing to the eye when
<br/>Broadway is swept by clouds of summer dust, and grateful
  <br/>to the nostrils in dog-days.</p>
         <p>Let us walk up, on the sunny side of this great thorough-
fare, as far as</p>
THE PARK.
<p>The English and the French have not yet decided whether
<br/>London or Paris is the head-quarters of European civilization.
<br/>There can be no doubt with regard to the head-quarters of
<br/>civilization in America. To this distinction New-York has
<br/>an undisputed claim; and the Park is the centre of New-
<br/>York. In that highly-respectable-looking building, the City
<br/>Hall, Law, on which all civilization is founded, rears its aw-
<br/>ful head, unwigged. In Canton and Calcutta—in Mexico
<br/>and Guatimala, people talk of "the Park." Everybody who
<br/>comes to New-York, makes the Park the nucleus around
<br/>which all his ideas of Gothamian localities arrange them-
<br/>selves. There! the fire-bell tolls! It is a solemn, porten-
<br/>tous sound! Already the engines are rattling along the
<br/>rough street One would think the firemen must stand on
<br/>the qui vive from morning to night, and from night to morn-
<br/>ing, with their engines on the pavement, and the ropes in
<br/>their hands, ready to start at the first note of alarm, and ar-
<br/>ray the elements each other—water against fire. See<div class="pagebreak" id="#page260"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
         </p>
         <p>how the school-boys fly across the gravelled walks, leaving
<br/>their cricket-bats and balls, to find out where the blaze is!
<br/>Red-flannel shirts, and glazed hats—mitre-crowned, quaker-
<br/>brimmed—lead the way. Hurrah ! it is a glorious time for
<br/>these young fellows ! Their hot blood beats high in their
<br/>pulses. The reaction, after this excitement, will cool the
<br/>fever in their veins ; and, if the fever did not waste itself
<br/>on a few such things as these, the community might feel its
<br/>effects in some less venial encroachments upon the public
<br/>peace.</p>
         <p>That fountain !—we must not forget to speak of the foun-
<br/>tain, now shaped like a fan, then like an umbrella—now
<br/>dancing in mid-air, then falling in silver spray into the basin
<br/>below. Of how many beautiful things it is an emblem!
<br/>How suggestive of pure thoughts—of holy aspirations ! It is
<br/>the “genius loci”—the good genius of the place. Who knows
<br/>the extent of its humanizing influences upon the tens of thou-
<br/>sands who gaze upon it as they pass? We living things,
<br/>called men,—we insulated spirits, bottled up in matter, and
<br/>floating down the resistless stream—are wondrously affected
<br/>by externals. The physical and the intellectual—the visible
<br/>and the invisible—the tangible and the immaterial, are full of
<br/>analogies, coincidences, and harmonies. But, as this article
<br/>is intended to be read, it will be expedient so eschew meta-
<br/>physics.</p>
         <p>Here are thirty coaches in a line, and thirty coachmen
<br/>looking out for fares—most of them whistling, as sailors do,
<br/>when they want to raise the wind. I often wonder whether
<br/>it is possible that the majority of these loafers can earn
<br/>enough in a day to buy grease for their axles. It is almost
<br/>an event to see one of them getting a job ; and yet here they
<br/>stand, winter and summer, in storm and sunshine, mending
<br/>their whips and quarrelling about the next nomination to the
<br/>presidency. The motto of the Epicurean is “a short life and
<br/>a merry one the motto of these hackmen is—a long life
<br/>and a lazy one.</p>
        THE SHOPS.
<p>Trusting that these facts and reflections have produced a
<br/>deep impression upon the mind of the susceptible reader, we
<br/>shall, with his permission, continue our ambulatory progress
<br/>toward “ Japonica-dom.”</p>
        <p>The merchants have already began to set up their awn-
<br/>ings, for the rays of the noonday sun are even now sufficient-
<br/>ly powerful to spoil the dyes of the beautiful fabrics that
<br/>tempt us from every window. Many of these stores are
<br/>really splendid ; and their arrangements indicate a cultiva-
<br/>ted taste on the part of the designers. There are three or
<br/>four establishments in Broadway, unsurpassed in London or
<br/>Paris; and many of their fair patronesses are unrivalled in
<br/>Cork or Circassia. If the reader is a lady, it is requested
<br/>tha.. she will consider herself especially alluded to in this last
<br/>expression of opinion. Here it may be proper, before pro-
<br/>ceeding farther, to whistle in a low tone “ The Groves of
<br/>Blarney.”</p>
        THE PASSING CROWD.
<p>During a walk of ten minutes, to meet five or six thousand
<br/>people, each moving along with a separate purpose, is cal-
<br/>culated to awake reflection in the dullest. A few years ago,
<br/>all these men and women were little children, amusing
<br/>themselves with tops and skipping ropes, and going to
<br/>school: a few years hence, they will all know how much of
<br/>our current theology is based upon eternal truth—how much
<br/>upon the false and flimsy theories of men: for they will be
<br/>among those unseen realities, on which we too often descant
<br/>so thoughtlessly and speculate so absurdly. This is an idea
<br/>with which all are familiar; but its vast bearings are mea-
<br/>sured only by a few.</p>
        <p>Omnibuses—omnibuses—omnibuses! what a convenience!
<br/>what a nuisance! Go back for a moment to the time of
<br/>Abraham, and the patriarchal institutions on which all soci-
<br/>ety is based. Think of dwelling in tents, and believing in
<br/>astrology, and riding on camels. Then think of a crowd of
<br/>people rushing down Broadway in four-wheeled boxes, drawn
<br/>by the degenerate representatives of Arabian coursers. The
<br/>effect of contrast in time, place, and circumstance is amusing,
<br/>you will admit. Abraham flourished in the nineteenth cen-
<br/>tury before the Christian era,—we, in the nineteenth century
<br/>after it. What stirring dramas have been enacted during the
<br/>long interval! Nineteen centuries more, and antiquaries
<br/>will perhaps be rambling with their note books among the
<br/>scarce distinguishable ruins of this great city, and inquiring<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>of the herdsmen, who shall feed their flocks between Harlem
<br/>and the Battery, concerning the whereabouts of the ancient
<br/>Broadway ! Mutandum est omnibus—the omnibuses must
<br/>pass away !</p>

         <div class="note" id="">Translated from the French.</div>
         <p>It was but the other day that I chanced to be crossing the
<br/>gloomy vestibule of the Palais de Justice, called with much
<br/>reason the Hall des Pas Perdus. The door leading to the
<br/>different court rooms, opened on a large platform, chequered
<br/>with grey and black stones. It was the hour of opening the
<br/>courts, and several hundred persons were passing to and fro;
<br/>the scraping of their feet, mingling with the dull sound of
<br/>voices, echoed from the wall of the vaulted building.</p>
          <p> The advocates a robe neuve carried under their arms enor-
<br/>mous bundles of papers. On the other hand, the members of
<br/>the bar who were shabbily dressed, burdened themselves
<br/>with nothing, except perhaps a small roll, which brought to
<br/>mind the baton of the marshals of France. Some of these car-
<br/>ried the luxury of carelessness in attire to a singular excess. I
<br/>observed particularly, one gown with sad rents in the back,
<br/>and sleeves fringed with tatters ; the lining presented a curi-
<br/>ous sample of all the shades, aided by grease, dust, and long
<br/>wearing, to an original ground of black. I hastened to see
<br/>who wore a garment so nearly in rags, and was surprised to
<br/>recognise one of our best and most celebrated lawyers. I
<br/>complimented him gravely on his costume.</p>
          <p> “ I should hardly have known the most famous of our ad-
<br/>vocates,” said I, “but I comprehend : the degree of rustiness
<br/>of costume designates the degree of celebrity ; the holes in
<br/>your toga serve, in your order, for epaulettes and marks of
<br/>distinction. The common soldiers have new robes—the ge-
<br/>nerals old and torn ones..”</p>
          <p> He smiled and replied, “This is the first and only gown I
<br/>have ever worn. I should not feel at ease in a new one; and
<br/>would not plead without this old friend upon my shoulders.
<br/>Indeed, it troubles me, I assure you, to be even under the
<br/>necessity of having it patched."</p>
          <p> “ I can easily believe that,” said I, casting an eye over
<br/>the tattered covering.</p>
          <p>“ And what are you doing here ?" asked he, “ you cannot
<br/>be engaged in a suit, or I should be the first to be informed,
<br/>—eh !”</p>
           <p>“Certainly,” I replied, “ chance alone brings me into the
<br/>Hall des Pas-Perdus. I confess to you I have a horror of law
<br/>suits : the very sight of a brief makes me shudder.”</p>
           <p>“ You are wrong. The annals of law contain more of the
<br/>dramatic—more of the romantic and thrilling, than the most
<br/>fertile imagination could supply. Every one of its pages is a
<br/>history of intense interest. Open at hazard, read the first
<br/>lines, and you find what will move you to mirth, melt you to
<br/>tears, or cause you to grow pale with terror.”</p>
           <p>While speaking, the lawyer introduced the tip of his fin-
<br/>ger, at hazard, between two leaves of a volume he held, and
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page261"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
opened it. “Just as I said!” cried he, “ Look here ; chapter
<br/>3d, paragraph 138,—here we are in the midst of deep trage-
<br/>dy. I have ten minutes yet, before my cause comes on; so I
<br/>will tell you a story which the sight of this article brings to
<br/>mind.”</p>
           <p>“ In 1812, a young man, son of a colonel, who was killed
<br/>in battle, lived with his mother in the fifth story of a house,
<br/>in the rue Coquenard. Being the widow’s only son, he was
<br/>exempted from military service, much to his regret, for Gus-
<br/>tave Remicourt, like others at that time, had dreamed of bat-
<br/>tles, and the rewards of victory; the epaulettes of a general,
<br/>or a cross from the emperor’s own hands. His mother, whose
<br/>only means of support was a small pension allowed her as
<br/>the widow of an officer, old and infirm, and dependent on her
<br/>son’s daily cares, always wept when he talked of going to
<br/>the wars. He therefore stifled his regrets in his own breast,
<br/>and applied himself to his duties with affectionate zeal, per-
<br/>forming every day the monotonous services of a clerk to the
<br/>minister of finance. He never quitted his mother, except for
<br/>the bureau, and returned as soon as he was at liberty.</p>
           <p>“ At the time of the Russian campaign Madame Remicourt
<br/>could no longer get her pension paid ; and a hundred francs
<br/>a month, the salary of Gustave, was hardly sufficient for their
<br/>maintenance in the most humble manner! The poor invalid
<br/>tried to assist her son; but the effort only increased her ma-
<br/>lady to such a degree, that it was soon dangerous to leave
<br/>her alone. Gustave was reduced to the alternative of giving
<br/>up his clerkship, or of hiring a nurse.</p>
           <p>“The porters know all that passes in any part of their
<br/>houses. In spite of the care taken by Madame Remicourt
<br/>and her son to conceal their hapless condition, it was known
<br/>to all their neighbors. These had looked upon her as their
<br/>superior in rank and education, and had always observed to-
<br/>wards her a guarded respect, not only due to the rank of her
<br/>late husband, but imposed by her well dignified manner.
<br/>The knowledge that she needed assistance, encouraged these
<br/>good people to offer their services ; and two or three of the
<br/>females at length established themselves as regular nurses.</p>
           <p>“ Among these obliging but officious friends, was a young
<br/>Italian, the widow of a Piedmontese captain, who had per-
<br/>ished like Colonel Remicourt, in the service of France. Ma-
<br/>dame Giuseppa Vicento was beautiful, and possessed a de-
<br/>gree of talent and quickness of perception, which often sup-
<br/>plies to a certain extent, the defects of education. She was a
<br/>Neapolitan, and did not hesitate to acknowledge that her
<br/>husband had chosen her from the lowest rank of the people.
<br/>Her singular and noble style of beauty, and the grace of her
<br/>carriage, fully justified the captain’s love. She was extreme-
<br/>ly attentive to Madame Remicourt, who, on her part, con-
<br/>ceived for her a sentimeat of real friendship. The young
<br/>Italian became her privileged nurse. While Gustave was
<br/>absent at the bureau, she remained with his mother, and
<br/>wailed upon her with almost filial solicitude. She knew
<br/>how to divert the sufferer from melancholy thoughts, and to
<br/>cheer her with the hope of belter days: while listening to
<br/>her sweet and animating voice, Gustave felt no longer sad
<br/>or discouraged. Every morning he left her with regret; at
<br/>evening he hastened to return, and always found her by his
<br/>mother's side.</p>
           <p>“The space is not wide between gratitude and love, in
<br/>the heart of a young man of twenty; Gustave was soon des-
<br/>perately enamored of the fair Italian, nor could he at all
<br/>times conceal his passion. But the calm demeanor of Giu-
<br/>seppa, the veneration with which she inspired him, and the
<br/>timidity that always attends first love, prevented its avowal.
<br/>Meantime Giuseppa seemed to read his thoughts; for her
<br/>reserve towards him increased, and she more frequently
<br/>mentioned the name of her late husband.</p>
           <p>“ This conduct, by depriving him of hope, but rendered
<br/>more violent his passion. A smile from her sufficed to throw
<br/>him in raptures: and when she was colder than usual, he
<br/>would relapse into the deepest gloom. The signora seemed
<br/>unconscious of her power over Gustave: and whenever Ma-
<br/>dame Remicourt, uneasy on her son’s account, alluded to it,
<br/>she would turn the conversation with admirable address.</p>
           <p>“ The condition of the invalid suddenly became alarming.
<br/>The physician who visited her did not conceal his apprehen-
<br/>sions from Giuseppa. and one morning, urged by Gustave s
<br/>questions, she informed him that his mothers end was near.
<br/>Struck by the dreadful intelligence, the young man sunk into
<br/>a chair, rigid and insensible. His mother saw him and was
<br/>terrified; she sprang from her bed, and called his name with <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>her dying voice : Gustave recalled to sense by the sound,
<br/>hastened to support her in his arms; she sank upon his
<br/>breast, and breathed her last sigh.</p>
           <p>“The bereaved son was seized with convulsions; the
<br/>neighbors were obliged to tear him from his mother’s corpse,
<br/>and remove him to a neighboring room. For many days he
<br/>lay between life and death, prostrated by a brain fever. On
<br/>the fifteenth day reason returned ; the first name he uttered
<br/>was his mother’s; the first person he recognised was Giu-
<br/>seppa; she had watched by him during the severest parox-
<br/>ysms of his illness. She had taken on herself the duty of at-
<br/>tending to the burial of his mother, and had even sold some
<br/>jewels of her own to defray the expenses of the funeral.</p>
           <p>“ ‘ He could only bathe the hand of Giuseppa with tears,
<br/>and cover it with passionate kisses. She did not withdraw
<br/>the hand; neither did she change the conduct she had adopt-
<br/>ed towards him. As his health was gradually re-established,
<br/>she saw him less and less frequently. Gustave earnestly
<br/>longed to ask the reason of this reserve, but he was not yet
<br/>quite prepared to make an avowal of his love.</p>
           <p>“At last he was well enough to return to his duties at the
<br/>bureau. One evening, a day having passed without seeing
<br/>Giuseppa, he summoned courage to go to her lodgings, and
<br/>ask her to accompany him to Ins mother’s grave. The sig-
<br/>nora, without hesitation, wrapped herself in a shawl and took
<br/>his arm.</p>
           <p>“When they came to the cemetery, and the bereaved
<br/>youth had read the name of his mother, carved on a wooden
<br/>cross, he fell on his knees, and relieved the oppression of his
<br/>heart by a hurst of tears. He then rose, and offering his hand
<br/>to the Italian, said:</p>
           <p>“ I am now alone in the world; alone! for you love me
<br/>not, madame!’</p>
           <p>“ She raised her hand, and looked at him fixedly, but did
<br/>not reply.</p>
           <p>“Why did you not suffer me to die?' he asked. ‘What
<br/>would you have me do with the wretched life you have pre-
<br/>served ?’</p>
           <p>“She smiled pensively, and said—‘A few months of ab-
<br/>sence will cure you of this : it is more in your head than in
<br/>your heart. The loneliness of your condition since your mo-
<br/>ther’s death, has caused you to feel the need of attaching your-
<br/>self to some one, and I chanced to be the first—the only per-
<br/>son who was near you.’</p>
           <p>“ Oh spare me ! do not rend my heart!’ cried he in a voice
<br/>of despair.</p>
           <p>“Listen to me,’she resumed. ‘Love, with us Italians,
<br/>is not a feeble, fleeting sentiment, content with little. He
<br/>that I love, shall be the idol of my life; for him I would joy-
<br/>fully sacrifice existence—happiness—conscience, itself! Thus
<br/>will I love; thus would I be loved.’</p>
           <p>“And do I not love you thus?’</p>
           <p>“You believe so—but I repeat, you love me not. I will
<br/>prove you, Monsieur Gustave. I am very poor; to pay the
<br/>last duties to your mother, I sold the jewels which were my
<br/>last resource. If it were necessary—to save me from misery,
<br/>from hunger—to commit a crime, could you ? You tremble,
<br/>you grow pale! Reassure yourself: I was only jesting. You
<br/>see plainly that your love is all a delusion.’</p>
           <p>“ Giuseppa then began to walk homeward, without taking
<br/>Gustave’s arm. He remained standing, with his head droop-
<br/>ed upon his breast.</p>
           <p>“For two days, he avoided the Italian ; at the end of that
<br/>time, he entered her apartment. She was sitting before a
<br/>table, embroidering, without her shawl, though the weather
<br/>was cold, and with but little fire on the hearth.</p>
           <p>“Gustave laid on the table a banknote worth five hundred
<br/>francs. ‘ I have anticipated part of my year’s salary,’ said
<br/>he with sorrowful pride.</p>
           <p>“ 'It is well,’ answered she quietly; ‘I can buy another
<br/>shawl. I sold mine this morning for bread.’ She regarded
<br/>him at the same time with an expressive look, as much as to
<br/>say—‘ As I sold my jewels to bury your mother.’</p>
           <p>“'You are right—Alas!’ cried he; ‘I have hardly yet ful-
<br/>filled a mere duty. How will you prove my gratitude and
<br/>love?'</p>
           <p>“ She smiled disdainfully, without raising her head, and an-
<br/>swered, ‘ were I in your place, I should have no need to ask.’</p>
           <p>" ‘ Giuseppa!’</p>
           <p>" ' I was never loved but once. He who loved me was poor;
<br/>but bavin" seen me he won for me rank, opulence, and hap-
<br/>piness ; he counted nothing; stopped at nothing; so I was<div class="pagebreak" id="#page262"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>proud to bear his name—and adore him as a deity.’</p>
           <p>“ ' But you repel my love; you plunge me into despair.
<br/>Consent to become my wife ; I feel that I shall then toil with
<br/>an ardor that must ensure success.’</p>
           <p>“ ' Oh yes!’ interrupted she, ironically, ' during the week,
<br/>I should be the servant of your humble lodgings ; on Sunday
<br/>I should, perhaps, have the recreation of a walk ; my ideal
<br/>of the future would be the hope of your obtaining one day,
<br/>perchance, the situation of head-clerk !'</p>
           <p>" ' But in mercy, Giuseppa, tell me what I must do ?’
<br/>“ ' Act, and do not talk about it. Vicento would have found
<br/>out.’ ”</p>
           <p>Here my friend the advocate was silent a few moments.</p>
           <p>“ Six months after,” resumed he, “ I was invited to a ball
<br/>at the house of the Signora Giuseppa. She lived in a rich
<br/>hotel in the Rue de l’Universite, and all Paris talked of the
<br/>splendor of her entertainments. I could not help observing,
<br/>that evening, the extreme paleness and agitation of M. Remi-
<br/>court. He was continually falling into gloomy reveries, from
<br/>which he would start suddenly, glancing about him with a
<br/>look of terror. At other times he would gaze fixedly at per-
<br/>sons in company, yet seem unconscious of their presence.</p>
           <p>" The queen of the festivities was the beautiful Italian.
<br/>Dressed superbly, and blazing with jewels, she yielded her-
<br/>self with girlish delight to the pleasure of the dance. Some-
<br/>times, in passing Gustave, she would throw on him a smiling
<br/>glance, and then his whole face would light up with joy ; but
<br/>when she was gone, he relapsed into gloom. This singular
<br/>conduct was easily explained ; it was generally understood
<br/>that he was an unsuccessful wooer of the lovely widow. This
<br/>I learned from the observations of persons near me.</p>
           <p>“ After that, I lost sight for a year, of M. de Remicourt and
<br/>Giuseppa. I had just made my debut at the bar, with con-
<br/>siderable success. My professional engagements condemned
<br/>me to incessant labor, and left me no leisure to mingle in fash-
<br/>ionable gaieties. One morning I received a note; a woman
<br/>begged me to stop at the Conciergerie, where she was im-
<br/>prisoned. This woman was Giuseppa.”</p>
           <p>At this moment an attorney came out of the first chamber,
<br/>and hastening towards us, informed my companion that his
<br/>cause had come on.</p>
           <p>“ Hang the cause,” cried I “ I want the rest of your story.”</p>
           <p>“ You shall have it some other time,” said my friend, and
<br/>adjusting his tattered gown, he entered the court room. I
<br/>followed and listened with great interest to his admirable
<br/>pleading.</p>
           <p>At eight the court adjourned. The advocate then took me
<br/>by the arm, and went out, continuing the story as if he had
<br/>not been interrupted.</p>
           <p>“ I found Giuseppa in prison, but dressed with the taste
<br/>which had always characterised her. She smiled, reached
<br/>me her hand, invited me to sit down, and did the honors of
<br/>her cell with as much grace as I had seen her do the honors
<br/>of her salon.</p>
           <p>“I took a seat, and waited for the fair Italian to explain
<br/>the cause of her arrest, and her motive in sending for me.</p>
           <p>“At length she said—‘ Monsieur, though yet young, you
<br/>have a high reputation among the members of the bar in
<br/>Paris. I think, also, I have had the pleasure of meeting you
<br/>sometimes in society, and even of receiving you at my house.
<br/>For these reasons I have recourse to you in the embarrass-
<br/>ment caused by my sudden arrest. May I count upon your
<br/>assistance ?’</p>
           <p>“All this was said with an ease, calmness, and even a
<br/>levity, that showed not the least disquiet of mind.</p>
           <p>“ I bowed my head in sign of assent.</p>
           <p>" ‘ How do the laws of France,’ she continued, ' punish the
<br/>crime of counterfeiting bank-notes?’</p>
           <p>“ I showed her a paper containing the words—‘ the pun-
<br/>ishment of forgery shall be death.'</p>
           <p>" ' But,’ cried she with a smile, ‘ here is another clause a
<br/>little below. ‘ The law rewards the informer.’</p>
           <p>“ I read her the following paragraph:—' Art. 148. Persons
<br/>guilty of the crimes mentioned in articles 132 and 133, shall
<br/>be exempted from punishment, provided, before prosecution,
<br/>they give information of the crimes, and discover the chief
<br/>criminals to the proper authorities; or if, even after the
<br/>commencement of a prosecution against them, they furnish
<br/>such information as shall procure the arrest of other guilty
<br/>persons.’</p>
           <p>“With a slight but graceful gesture, she twined her slen-
<br/>der fingers in her beautiful dark hair. ' Ah!’ she exclaimed,<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>' the law pardons the informer! Thanks—and adieu, Mon-
<br/>sieur l’avocat.’</p>
           <p>“ The same evening, the friend who had accompanied me
<br/>to Giuseppa’s ball, informed me that Gustave Remicourt had
<br/>been arrested, upon what charge no one could divine. Alas!
<br/>I divined but too well! the next day, with my friend, I vis-
<br/>ited the young man in prison. He appeared calm, though
<br/>not altogether unconcerned. ' My arrest,’ said he, " is caused
<br/>by some mistake. There does not exist the least proof
<br/>against me.’</p>
             <p>" ' Monsieur,’ I asked, ' do you know the articles in the
<br/>code relative to the crime of forgery ?’</p>
             <p>"' No, monsieur,’ he replied.</p>
             <p>“ The law exempts from all punishment, those who inform
<br/>against their accomplices.’</p>
             <p>" ‘If I had accomplices,’ answered he coolly, 'I would suf-
<br/>fer death a thousand times, rather than betray them.’</p>
             <p>" ' But think you, others would observe the like generosity
<br/>towards you ?’</p>
             <p>" ' You know my secret, monsieur,’ he murmured with a
<br/>broken voice.</p>
             <p>" ' Are you not the victim of an accusation ?’</p>
             <p>" ' Giuseppa!—of hers !—oh no ! I would not believe her
<br/>capable of such baseness ! Oh no ! chance has put justice on
<br/>the traces of my crime.’</p>
           <p>" ' Why had you not recourse to flight, when you heard of
<br/>her arrest ? You had time to save yourself.’</p>
           <p>" ' Because I wished to save her. This very night the guards
<br/>of the Conciergerie, gained over by gold, had promised to loos-
<br/>en the bars of Giuseppa’s window, and aid her escape. I
<br/>should then have carried her to England. Ah ! I regret the
<br/>loss of liberty and life only for her sake ! But I will yet save
<br/>her, monsieur ! Before my judges I will assume myself the
<br/>whole of the guilt of the crime charged against her. Poor
<br/>Giuseppa !’</p>
           <p>" After his arrest Gustave saw the Italian but once ; and
<br/>that was when the judge who committed him caused them
<br/>to be brought together in his presence. Prudence, and his
<br/>resolution to save Giuseppa, enabled him to restrain his emo-
<br/>tions.</p>
           <p>" When, on the trial, he saw her come into court, he could
<br/>not conceal his agitation ; but uttering a faint cry, stretched
<br/>out his hands towards her. She passed close by him, her
<br/>eyes fixed on the ground; and took her place, not with the
<br/>accused, but among the witnesses. Gustave looked at her,
<br/>and sank back on his seat. The judges entered at that mo-
<br/>ment, and the court was opened.</p>
           <p>" The first witness called was Giuseppa. She confessed
<br/>her part in the crime charged against Remicourt, and fur-
<br/>nished the most incontrovertible details respecting the issue
<br/>of the false bills. Frequently the murmurs of the specta-
<br/>tors interrupted without in the least discomposing her. Gus-
<br/>tave listened in silence, and when the president interrogated
<br/>him, only replied, ' All that madame has said is true.’</p>
           <p>“ The depositions being taken, and the procureur-general
<br/>having spoken, I rose in my turn. I endeavored to show-
<br/>that there were extenuating circumstances to be taken into
<br/>view on behalf of my unfortunate client, who had evidently
<br/>been enticed into crime by the woman who had betrayed him.
<br/>But he interrupted my pleading.</p>
           <p>" ' My guilt is proved,’ he said with firmness; 'I have
<br/>confessed it; let my sentence be pronounced.’</p>
           <p>" The prisoner was condemned to death, but the verdict
<br/>being accompanied by a recommendation to mercy, his pun-
<br/>ishment was commuted to imprisonment for life.</p>
           <p>" The next day I visited Remicourt, in company with a
<br/>friend, who gave him a bible, under the cover of which was
<br/>concealed a poison.</p>
           <p>" ' I thank you,’ said Gustave, ‘but I will not avail myself
<br/>of this means of escape from infamy. I have yet a duty to
<br/>fulfil before leaving this world.’</p>
           <p>“I offered to appeal from the judgment, and procure a new
<br/>trial, but he obstinately refused his consent. Eight days
<br/>after he departed for the galleys, wearing the dress and load-
<br/>ed with the chains of the galley-slaves. Giuseppa was set
<br/>at liberty the day after the trial. She immediately sent to
<br/>the prison of Remicourt, means to facilitate his escape ; but
<br/>he refused to use them.</p>
           <p>" You remember the exciting political events from 1812, to
<br/>1816 ?—the invasion of France, the taking of Paris, the resto-
<br/>ration, the return from Elba, the hundred days, Waterloo,
<br/>and finally the second return of the Bourbons. In the tu-<div class="pagebreak" id="#page263"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>mult of these stupendous events, Gustave and Giuseppa pas-
<br/>sed from my recollection.</p>
           <p>“One evening at the carnival, in 1817, fatigued with a
<br/>week of unusual labor, I went in search of recreation and di-
<br/>version, to a ball at Frascati’s, resolving to play the idler for
<br/>at least a few hours. The crowd became so compact and so
<br/>disorderly, that I was forced against the wall of one of the
<br/>salons, and nearly crushed to death, when a mask came to
<br/>my relief, and with powerful efforts forcing a way through
<br/>the living mass, carried me into a room where, thanks to his
<br/>attentions, I soon recovered recollection and breath. I ex-
<br/>pressed my gratitude for this timely assistance, and begged
<br/>my preserver to tell me his name, or let me see his face ;
<br/>but he answered only by an imperative gesture enjoining si-
<br/>lence, and leaving the cabinet, disappeared in the crowd. I
<br/>had only time to notice the whiteness of his hands, and a
<br/>large diamond ring on his finger.</p>
           <p>“It would have been prudent to have quitted the hall at
<br/>once, and returned home; but I continued to enjoy with a
<br/>sort of childish pleasure, the gaiety of a scene that had so
<br/>nearly proved fatal to me.</p>
           <p>“ Ere long I noticed a lady magnificently wearing on her
<br/>head a coronet of diamonds. The splendor of her dress was
<br/>lost in her beauty, which was heightened by an air of noble-
<br/>ness and majesty, that commanded universal attention. It
<br/>was Giuseppa ! She cast her eyes upon me, but the indiffer-
<br/>ence of her look caused me to think she had not recognised
<br/>me.</p>
           <p>“ As for me, the sight of her inspired me with such unea-
<br/>siness and horror, that I quilted the hall, and went to the
<br/>rooms where gaming parlies were at play. The sight of
<br/>gold, the emotions of the players, and the various fortunes
<br/>of the game, filled me with a kind of intoxication ; I could
<br/>not resist the temptation of joining them. I lost; but losing
<br/>at cards only urges to the trial of new chances; I continued
<br/>to play, anxious and breathless, as fortune continued unfavor-
<br/>able to me, when I felt a hand laid on my shoulder. I turn-
<br/>ed quickly, ashamed of having been surprised at a gaming
<br/>table by one of my friends, and saw the black domino that
<br/>had rescued me in the early part of the evening.</p>
           <p>“ ‘ You owe me your life, monsieur,’ said he, ' I will now
<br/>render you another service equally great; play no more ! It
<br/>is not in the violent and vulgar emotions excited at cards
<br/>that you should spend your mental activity. Reserve all
<br/>your energies for success at the bar, and leave gaming to
<br/>unfortunate wretches reduced by fate to this refuge from
<br/>thought.’</p>
           <p>“ While I regarded him with surprise, he put into my
<br/>hands the bank-note that I had just laid on the table, and
<br/>taking from his pocket a handful of gold threw it down at
<br/>hazard before the roulette. He gained ; in ten minutes I had
<br/>recovered my losses, and the black domino had acquired a
<br/>considerable sum.</p>
           <p>“I retired, but remained standing among the crowd, cu-
<br/>rious to see more of the person who had rendered me such
<br/>services. His figure was concealed in the large folds of a do-
<br/>mino of black satin, his face bidden by a mask of the same
<br/>hue. closed tightly ; his beard flowed down upon his breast.
<br/>He seemed at once to defy and govern chance; for during
<br/>several hours, he was invariably a winner. By degree the
<br/>rumor of his singular fortune spread to the ball room, and
<br/>numbers came out to see 'he man who seemed thus possess-
<br/>ed of magical powers. He showed no emotion at finding
<br/>himself the object of general curiosity. Suddenly, however,
<br/>he was seized with a violent convulsive trembling; I rushed
<br/>to his side, and supported him ; he would else have fallen to
<br/>the ground.</p>
           <p>‘ Take me away—for pity !’ murmured he. faintly. I forc-
<br/>ed my way out of the room, dragging him along, and leaving
<br/>large sums of his money on the table.</p>
           <p>“In a few minutes he recovered his composure. He rose
<br/>quickly, disengaged himself from my arm, and laughed bit-
<br/>terly, and as I thought, convulsively. ‘Ah!' he exclaimed,
<br/>'at last the hour has struck—the hour!’</p>
            <p>' You assisted me: I thank you, and have yet a request to
<br/>make. Take these bills which I have just won, and restore
<br/>them only to me, or to the person who will give you the
<br/>name engraved in the inside of this watch, which I also de-
<br/>posite in your hands.’</p>
           <p>" He gave me his pocket-book, placed his watch in my
<br/>hand, and hastened back to the card table. His luck had
<br/>not abandoned him, even during his absence. Everybody<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>looked at him in astonishment, and almost with superstitious
<br/>fear. While gathering up the money he had gained, he
<br/>cast his eyes around, and fixed them on Giuseppa, who had
<br/>come with others to see the wonderful player.</p>
           <p>‘Will you play, Madame?’ he asked.</p>
           <p>“ She smiled, and put into the hands of a gentleman who
<br/>was with her a purse of gold, which he staked. Fortune
<br/>ceased to be favorable to the masked player. He lost all he
<br/>had won since he returned to the table.</p>
           <p>‘I have brought you ill luck,’said Giuseppa.</p>
           <p>‘Ah!’ replied he with a gesture of indifference, ‘ I cannot
<br/>have two pleasures at once, and I prefer that of looking at
<br/>you to the insipid one of winning gold.’</p>
           <p>“ She gave a slight toss of her head. ‘ But’ added the
<br/>mask, ‘fortune will befriend me again, if I wish it.’</p>
           <p>“ He threw his last bank note on the table. The boast
<br/>was verified ; he was once more a winner.</p>
           <p>‘You are a magician!’ cried Giuseppa: the mask was
<br/>looking fixedly at her.</p>
           <p>‘If you please,’ said he, ‘I will show you my secret for
<br/>commanding fortune.’</p>
           <p>“ She hesitated a few moments before quitting the arm of
<br/>her escort, but at last made a step towards the unknown.
<br/>He was at her side in an instant, and threw the gold in his
<br/>hands among the crowd surrounding the table. This of
<br/>course caused a scuffle and confusion, in the midst of which
<br/>the black mask seized the arm of the Italian, and drew her
<br/>towards the ball room. I followed unobserved, but so close
<br/>behind them that I could not help hearing what they said.
<br/>The language of the mask was that of a man passionately
<br/>enamored.</p>
           <p>‘I have long loved you’—faltered he; ‘ long watched your
<br/>movements, long followed your steps. My heart, hand, for-
<br/>tune, are devoted to you. A voice that never decieves, tells
<br/>me that we have been affianced for years. Yousee, I can
<br/>dispose of fate as I choose !’</p>
           <p>‘ Ha!’ she cried with some appearance of agitation—
<br/>‘ would you have me regard as serious the pleasantries of a
<br/>masked ball ?’</p>
           <p>‘ My words are serious: I repeat it, we are affianced;
<br/>nothing shall separate us in future.’</p>
           <p>“ At this moment, the musicians began to play a waltz;
<br/>the mask encircled with his arm the waist of the Italian,
<br/>and drew her among the dancers. The circle was but small,
<br/>so that every few moments, in the measure, Giuseppa and
<br/>her partner were brought close to me, and I heard much of
<br/>what they said. With a kind of strange intuition, I compre-
<br/>hended the sense of these interrupted words, heard as it
<br/>were by stealth, amidst the noise of the crowd,, the tumultu-
<br/>ous clamor of voices, and the music of the orchestra.</p>
           <p>'Ah—you do not know me?’ said the mask. ‘But I
</p>
         <p>know you well; I know the smallest details of your whole
<br/>life; I will tell them if you choose.—Dance Giuseppa, I
<br/>should say—Madame Vicento!’</p>
           <p>“ Giuseppa started, and placed her hand on her breast.
<br/>‘I feel a prick in my side,’ she exclaimed ; ‘a pin is hurting
<br/>me.'</p>
           <p>“ They passed ; I heard no more till both were brought
<br/>round again.</p>
           <p>‘It is nothing. What is the prick of a pin, in the bewilder-
<br/>ment of the waltz, at the moment when your destiny is about
<br/>to be accomplished ?	,</p>
           <p>“ The music played more briskly ; the dancers moved more
<br/>rapidly. As they passed again, I heard the mask say—</p>
           <p>‘What have you done with the young man who loved you
<br/>so much—with Gustave ’</p>
           <p>'Heavens ! the pin hurts me severely ! Stop—let us stop
<br/>—for mercy’s sake!’</p>	
           <p>“ But he bore her on, more impetuously than ever.</p>
           <p>‘He loved you passionately—with so much faith—so
<br/>much devotion! What have you done with him ?’</p>
           <p>'This pricking—oh ! what pain! what pain !'</p>
           <p>“Again they passed,—I sought them eagerly: but had
<br/>hardly caught a glimpse of them, than a bound brought them
<br/>near me. I heard the wild voice of the mask !</p>
           <p>'You enticed him into crime—into infamy! In exchange
<br/>for his love, you gave him—the galleys!</p>
           <p>'For mercy's sake, Monsieur! I am dying with pain!
<br/>The pricking is more severe than ever!'</p>
           <p>'To save yourself'—cried he, 'you, who devised the crime
<br/>—you, who reaped its sole fruits—betrayed and sold him!
<br/>You abandoned him to death, without compassion.'</p>
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page264"/>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
           <p>'Heap your reproaches upon me ; I merit them. But for
<br/>pity’s sake, monsieur, let me rest. This frightful pain—I
<br/>can support it no longer.’</p>
           <p>“ He grasped her as a tiger would seize his prey.</p>
           <p>‘Waltz on—you shall not stop !’ he cried. They whirled
<br/>again round the circle.</p>
           <p>'	I will cry for help—help ! Oh ! my heart! the pain is
<br/>in my heart!’</p>
           <p>“I felt the locks of Giuseppa brush against my cheek.
<br/>The mask laughed scornfully.</p>
           <p>'Cry out! the music will drown your voice.’</p>
           <p>‘Help! help!’ cried she, struggling.</p>
           <p>“ During this strange scene I stood motionless and appalled.
<br/>I could hear the voice of her tormentor more terrible than
<br/>ever.</p>
           <p>‘ Cry out again, and you die instantly ! This pricking is
<br/>from the point of my stiletto; it has slowly pierced your
<br/>breast.’</p>
           <p>‘ Help me!’</p>
           <p>“ I rushed towards them. The ma,sk cried in her ear, ‘ It
<br/>is the hand of Gustave that holds the steel.’</p>
           <p>‘ Great heaven ! aid me !—aid !’</p>
           <p>‘ Hold ! would you perish ? Before any one comes to help
<br/>you I will plunge it in your heart!’</p>
           <p>'In spite of my efforts, I could not keep up with them. I
<br/>heard no more, but in every turn of the waltz I saw the face
<br/>of Giuseppa—her eyes fixed with horror—her cheek growing
<br/>paler and paler ; her livid lips striving to articulate. At last
<br/>some crimson drops fell on her gauze dress. The inexorable
<br/>mask clasped his victim more closely in his arms. The cre-
<br/>scendo of the musicians announced that the waltz was at an
<br/>end; when a cry of mortal anguish startled every one pre-
<br/>sent. I rushed to the spot. Giuseppa had sunk to the ground;
<br/>a fine stiletto had pierced her heart.</p>
           <p>“Search was instantly made for the murderer; the gates
<br/>were closed, and no one permitted to go forth till alter a
<br/>strict examination. But it was unsuccessful; all that could
<br/>be found was a black domino, spotted with blood, and thrown
<br/>in a corner of the vestibule.</p>
           <p>“I never heard afterwards of Remicourt; and placed the
<br/>money he had left with me in the funds of one of the hospi-
<br/>tals of Paris. No one has ever come to claim the watch, or
<br/>mentioned the name engraved within it. Here it is”—said
<br/>he, showing it to me.</p>
           <p>“ Ha ! I had no idea it was so late. Dupin and Oremieux
<br/>are waiting to consult with me. Adieu.”</p>

         <div class="head">THE OVAL PORTRAIT.</div>
           <p>The chateau into which my valet had ventured to make
<br/>forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately
<br/>wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one
<br/>of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which
<br/>have so long frowned among the Appenines, not less in fact
<br/>than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it
<br/>had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We estab-
<br/>lished ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuous-
<br/>ly furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the
<br/>building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique.
<br/>Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with mani-
<br/>fold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unu-
<br/>sually great number of very spirited modern paintings in
<br/>frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which
<br/>depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but
<br/>in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the
<br/>chateau rendered necessary—in these paintings my incipient
<br/>delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so
<br/>that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room—
<br/>since it was already night—to light the longues of a tall
<br/>candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed—and to
<br/>throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet
<br/>which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that
<br/>I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to
<br/>the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a
<br/>small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and
<br/>which purported to criticise and describe them.</p>
           <p>Long—long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I gazed.
<br/>Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by, and the deep mid-
<br/>night came. The position of the candelabrum displeased
<br/>me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than
<br/>disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its
<br/>rays more fully upon the book.</p>
         <br/>
         <div class="columnbreak"/>
          <p>But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated.
<br/>The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many)
<br/>now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto
<br/>been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts.	I
<br/>thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It
<br/>was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into woman-
<br/>hood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed
<br/>my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to
<br/>my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut,
<br/>I ran over in mind my reason for so shutting them. It was
<br/>an impulsive movement to gain time for thought—to make
<br/>sure that my vision had not deceived me—to calm and sub-
<br/>due my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a
<br/>very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>
          <p>That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt;
<br/>for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had
<br/>seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing
<br/>over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</p>
          <p>The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young
<br/>girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is
<br/>technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of
<br/>the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom and even
<br/>the ends of the radiant hair, melted imperceptibly into the
<br/>vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of
<br/>the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filagreed
<br/>in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more ad-
<br/>mirable than the painting itself. But it could have been
<br/>neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty
<br/>of the countenance, which bad so suddenly and so vehement-
<br/>ly moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fan-
<br/>cy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for
<br/>that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities
<br/>of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have
<br/>instantly dispelled such idea—must have prevented even its
<br/>momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these
<br/>points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half re-
<br/>clining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length,
<br/>satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back with-
<br/>in the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute
<br/>life-likeliness of expression, which at first startling, finally
<br/>confounded, subdued and appalled me. With deep and rev-
<br/>erent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position.
<br/>The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view,
<br/>I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings
<br/>and their histories. Turning to the number which designat-
<br/>ed the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words
<br/>which follow:</p>
            <p>“ She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely
<br/>than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and
<br/>loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious,
<br/>austere, and having already a bride in his Art: she a maiden
<br/>of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee: all
<br/>light and smiles, and frolicksome as the young fawn : loving
<br/>and cherishing all things : hating only the Art which was
<br/>her rival: dreading only the pallet and brushes and other
<br/>untoward instruments which deprived her of the counte-
<br/>nance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady
<br/>to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his
<br/>young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat
<br/>meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber
<br/>where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from over-
<br/>head. But he, the painter, look glory in his work, which
<br/>went on from hour to hour and from day to day. And he
<br/>was a passionate, and wild and moody man, who became
<br/>lost in reveries ; so that he would not see that the light which
<br/>fell so ghastlily in that lone turret withered the health and
<br/>the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him.
<br/>Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she
<br/>saw that the painter, (who had high renown,) took a fervid
<br/>and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night
<br/>to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more
<br/>dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld tbe
<br/>portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty
<br/>marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than
<br/>of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly
<br/>well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclu-
<br/>sion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the pain-
<br/>ter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned
<br/>his eyes from the canvas rarely, even to regard the counte-
<br/>nance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints
<br/>which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the
<br/>cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks<div class="pagebreak" id="#page265"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>had passed, and hut little remained to do, save one brush up-
<br/>on the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady
<br/>again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp.
<br/>And then the brush was given, and then the tint was plac-
<br/>ed ; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before
<br/>the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he
<br/>yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast,
<br/>and crying with a loud voice ‘This is indeed Life itself!’
<br/>turned suddenly to regard his beloved:—She was dead."</p>

<br/>The strife that sunward still, and higher,
<br/>Would ceaseless rise;
<br/>More in the strife than in the crown,
<br/>The virtue lies.
<br/>Still, at the mountain's wooded base
<br/>The fledgling hawk, though proud, may chase
<br/>A game too humble for the race
<br/>Of stronger plumes;
<br/>So may the soul her strength await,
<br/>Whom Hope illumes.
<br/>And should my day be limited,
<br/>Let conscious worth my soul bested ;
<br/>Glory may wreath the honored head,
<br/>But could not rise
<br/>With crown of stars, to match the worth
<br/>That higher lies.	</div>

         <div class="head">THE DIGNITY OF LABOR.</div>
           <p>This is one of the cant phrases of the day, but it is used
<br/>mainly by people who prefer to be undignified and idle.
<br/>The dignity of labor is a good phrase by itself, but we have
<br/>never heard it used by cartmen or hod-carriers, or kitchen
<br/>maids; neither have we known any body able to live in idle-
<br/>ness, voluntarily going to work for the sake of the dignity at-
<br/>tending upon useful employment. The most ambitious men
<br/>among us are covetous of the indignities of do-nothing-hood.
<br/>We hear every day people talk with great sincerity of the
<br/>dignity of labor, but yet nobody manifests any desire to gain
<br/>distinction by carrying a hod or trundling a porter’s barrow.
<br/>On the contrary, our ambitious men are not only very care-
<br/>ful to do nothing that is useful themselves, but they even es-
<br/>teem it an honor to be descended from ancestors who have
<br/>never labored. We know the son of a house carpenter who
<br/>blushes like scarlet whenever his father’s profession is allu-
<br/>ded to, while another gentleman of our acquaintance who
<br/>has been compelled to labor at a trade biinself, takes great
<br/>delight in boasting of his grandfather, who had never labor-
<br/>ed at any useful occupation in his life, but had lived on a
<br/>pension from government, which was awarded to him in
<br/>consideration of his having worn a pair of gilt epaulettes a
<br/>certain number of years. The dignity of labor, is a phrase
<br/>that was invented by certain people who wished to make<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>laborers contented with their condition, lest they should grow
<br/>dissatisfied and refuse to work any longer to support a cer-
<br/>tain number of their fellow beings in a state of idlehood;
<br/>but the laborers do not appear to appreciate the compliment
<br/>that has been so generously bestowed upon them, and as they
<br/>seem as little satisfied with their condition as ever, we would
<br/>throw out a hint to the philanthropists to bestow the titles
<br/>of honor which are now exclusively conferred upon idlers,
<br/>upon the laborers, and perhaps by this expedient those who
<br/>earn our daily bread for us might be induced to believe that
<br/>there is a real dignity in labor. In the event of a reversal of
<br/>titles taking place, those who labor the hardest should re-
<br/>ceive the highest honors. A gentleman farmer, or a boss
<br/>builder, would then call his ploughman or hod-carrier, your
<br/>excellency Andrew Maguire, while a member of Congress
<br/>would call his man Charles, “your honor,” and a rich brok-
<br/>er would address his coachman as Dennis O’Neal, Esq. A
<br/>boss workman or an overseer would, of course, be nothing
<br/>more than plain mister. A merchant’s wife would call her
<br/>chambermaids young ladies, and her cook madame. A sys-
<br/>tem like this would be very likely to have an extremely hap-
<br/>py effect upon the lower classes, and convince them that the
<br/>dignity of labor is not a mere hollow sound uttered by
<br/>quack philanthropists to please the ear of mountebank mor-
<br/>alists. As it is not unlikely that our hint will be taken by
<br/>the upper classes, who are fond of anything that smacks of
<br/>novelty, we will give a model or two lor the kind of recom-
<br/>mendation that should in such a case be given to a servant on
<br/>leaving his place.</p>

         <div>
            <div class="head">Thirteenth Annual Report of the Trustees of the Perkins Institution
and Massachusetts Asylum of the Blind.</div>
            <p>This exceedingly interesting report is from the pen of the
<br/>philanthropic Director of the Asylum at Mount Washington,
<br/>Dr. Howe. It is not simply a report of the condition of the
<br/>Institution, for it contains much collateral matter full of im-
<br/>portant suggestions to thinking minds. But the chief interest
<br/>of the report centres in that part of it which relates to Laura
<br/>Bridgman, the deaf and blind mute, whose deprivations
<br/>have rendered her name famous. It is generally known that
<br/>Dr. Howe had succeeded in opening a communication of
<br/>ideas with her, seemingly an almost impossible attempt, and
<br/>that under his care she was gradually coming to a knowledge
<br/>of the kind of world, physical and spiritual, which she inha-
<br/>bits. The great difficulty in the education of a mind like
<br/>hers, must be to keep it free from errors, for all abstract
<br/>truths and falsities must be alike to her, and an impression
<br/>once created upon her mind could scarcely be removed.
<br/>Feeling the importance of this, her instructor was very care-
<br/>ful not to allow any improper person to have communication
<br/>with her; but during his absence in Europe last year, it ap-
<br/>years that some busy-body, more zealous than discreet, un-
<br/>dertook to indoctrinate the poor girl with sectarian princi-
<br/>ples, and sadly deranged her ideas of the Deity by talking to
<br/>her of the Atonement, the Lamb of God, and some mystical
<br/>points of mere speculative doctrine. These things were, per-
<br/>haps, not further beyond her comprehension than of the per-
<br/>sons who talked to her about them ; but they perplexed her
<br/>more, because she required for every symbol a definite idea.
<br/>She could not understand metaphorical language; hence the
<br/>Lamb of God was to her a real animal, and she could not
<br/>conceive why it did not grow old like other lambs, and be
<br/>called a sheep. Her misconception of terms which, from
<br/>their familiarity, are to us so plain in their meaning, shows
<br/>how difficult the task must be always to convey exact
<br/>thoughts to her mind on abstract subjects. She appears to
<br/>be very much attached to Dr. Howe, and while he was in
<br/>Europe sent him several letters, one of which we extract
<br/>from the Report:—</p>
           <p>MY VERY DEAR Dr. Howe :
<br/>What can I first say to God when I am wrong? Would he send
<br/>me good thoughts and forgive me when I am very sad for doing
<br/>wrong ? Why does he not love wrong people if they love him ?
<br/>Would he be very happy to have me think of Him and Heaven very
<br/>often? Do you remember that you said I must think of God and Hea-
<br/>ven ? I want you to please to answer me to please me. I have learn-
<br/>ed about a great many things to please you very much. Mrs. Har-
<br/>rington has got a new little baby eight days last Saturday. God was
<br/>very generous and kind to give babies to many people. Miss Roger’s
<br/>mother has got baby two months ago. I want to see you very much.</p>
            <p>I send much love to you. Is God ever ashamed? I think of God very
<br/>often to love Him. Why did you say that I must think of God ? You
<br/>must answer me all about it, if you do not I shall be sad. Shall we
<br/>know what to ask God to do ? When will he let us go to see Him in
<br/>Heaven ! How did God tell people that he lived in Heaven ? How
<br/>could he take care of folks in Heaven and why is he our Father?
<br/>When can he let us go in Heaven ? Why can not He let wrong peo-
<br/>ple to go to live with Him and be happy ? Why should he not like to
<br/>have us ask him to send us good thoughts if we are not very sad for
<br/>doing wrong.</p>
            <p>The whole Report relating to this interesting girl is in-
<br/>tensely exciting, and we shall look forward to the annual
<br/>reports of Doctor Howe with a good deal of curiosity. She
<br/>could hardly have fallen into better hands for her own hap-
<br/>piness, or for the benefit of mankind. It is very apparent
<br/>that important hints in education may be gathered in watch-
<br/>ing the advancement of a mind like Laura Bridgman’s from
<br/>total darkness into the light of comparative day. Although
<br/>now on the verge of womanhood, she has less elementary
<br/>knowledge than a child of six years.</p>
            <p>The cases of blind and deaf mutes are not as rare as they

            <div class="head">The Diary of Lady Willoughby. No. 5 of Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library
of Choice Reading, pp. 100. Price 25 cents.</div>
            <p>The Diary of Lady Willoughby is framed on the exact plan
<br/>of the Amber Witch, and is quite as successful a composition
<br/>in its way, although it is entirely unlike that remarkable
<br/>production.</p>
            <p>It professes to be the diary of an English lady, in the lat-
<br/>ter part of the reign of Charles I, during the first fourteen
<br/>years of her married life. To make the resemblance to reality
<br/>the more perfect, the first edition in England was published
<br/>in exact imitation of books in the seventeenth century. This
<br/>external evidence of authenticity must have helped, in a de-
<br/>gree, to render more perfect the illusion which the author has
<br/>created, and it is not strange that many, even among learned
<br/>readers, believed it to be a genuine diary of the troublous times
<br/>of the English revolution. As a literary curiosity it could
<br/>have but little value for the million, but as a truthful record
<br/>of human affections, which are the same in all time, it will
<br/>have a value, like that of those simple tales which are al-
<br/>ways so acceptable to the great mass of English readers. A
<br/>lady of our acquaintance, who is no great devourer of books,
<br/>by the way, took it up by accident, and declared that she had
<br/>never been so bewitched by a book before. It is evidently
<br/>the work of a pious, tender-hearted mother—such a passage
<br/>as the following could have been written by none other:</p>
            <p>“ Arose this morning with mind more composed than for some time
<br/>past. Cicely’s mother ill, and I went down to see her: She is a bright
<br/>Example of Patience ; her Trials and Sufferings have been manifold,
<br/>bodily pain the least, has lost three children in infancy, and one
<br/>daughter grown up: and yet, can it be, has known still deeper sorrow.
<br/>Returned through the Park. Never saw the chestnuts and beeches
<br/>more beautiful in their autumnal tints, the fallen leaves crushed pleas-
<br/>antly beneath my feet; the Sun was setting before I was aware, and
<br/>the Aire grew suddenly chill. Taking the nearest way I entered the
<br/>house by aside door, and there beneath the old Mulberry saw the lit-
<br/>tle Carte and whip as they had been left by my poor Child the last
<br/>day he was out, when he looked so tired and I carried him in. I
<br/>stooped and look up the Whip, and hiding it beneath my cloke, went
<br/>straight up stairs: no Hand had touched it since his : the teares I wept
<br/>over it did me good: it seemed my innocent right to weep over this
<br/>Token of my lost one.</p>
            <p>“ The fullnesse and brightnesse of a young mother can never againe
<br/>be my experience, since that joy has been a Source of Suffering and
<br/>agony never to be forgotten. Death followed into the habitation
<br/>where life had just taken his abode. Not in short space of time can
<br/>the Heart recover such Dispensations, and in the excellency of no other
<br/>joys can it ever forget the stroke that first destroyed its sweetest hopes:
<br/>Death once seene at our Hearth leaveth a shadow which abideth there
<br/>forever.”</p>

<br/>the publication of which has just been begun by Henry G.
<br/>Daggers, 30 Ann street, on the cheap system; in respect of
<br/>which the editor, Mr. Benjamin, very justly remarks, in the
<br/>prospectus: “There is certainly no reason in the nature of
<br/>things why a novel should be more harmless when printed
<br/>in a costly and elegant style, than when issued so as to
<br/>render it obtainable by the poor as well as the rich, by the
<br/>laboring as well as the idle. Nevertheless there may be, and
<br/>doubtless is, some force in the objections to cheap literature,
<br/>based on the fact that the system has been abused. This,
<br/>however, should not cause any reader to reject, but simply to
<br/>discriminate. Before purchasing, even at the most paltry
<br/>prices, he should look at the name of the editor or publisher,
<br/>and, if either be a man of fair standing, give him the benefit
<br/>of it; his goods should be considered with as much discrimi-
<br/>nation as those of a manufacturer, and his stamp should
<br/>pass as current with the public.”</p>
           <p>It is greatly to be deplored that publishers are too seldom
<br/>influenced by any other motives in putting forth books, than
<br/>mercenary considerations, but books should not be regarded as
<br/>mere merchandise, and no publisher should allow his name to
<br/>appear on a book of pernicious tendencies, who wishes to pre-
<br/>serve the character of a good citizen, or establish himself in a
<br/>profitable business. The most successful publishers of cheap
<br/>books, are the Chambers, of Edinburgh, who have never, in
<br/>any instance pandered to the base feelings of our nature, by
<br/>the issue of improper books, or sought to gain popularity by
<br/>any species of trickery or meretricious show. Their eminent
<br/>success should embolden other publishers to imitate their
<br/>example.</p>
            <p>The books which Mr. Daggers has selected for the initials
<br/>of his series are unexceptionable of their kind, and they are of
<br/>a kind which will always be popular while there is a love tor
<br/>the marvelous in the human mind.</p>

College, etc., etc. New York : Harper &amp; Brothers.</div>
            <p>We believe that before the publication of Dr. Guy's book,
<br/>there was no convenient text-book of the English language
<br/>on the subject of Forensic Medicine. The voluminous work
<br/>of the Becks, although highly elaborate and meritorious was
<br/>for obvious reasons unadapted to the purposes of the student
<br/>—nor, indeed, as a manual for the legal or medical practi-
<br/>tioner, could it be considered as suitable in any respect. The
<br/>present volume omits every thing of merely literary interest
<br/>as well as all that concerns the history of Forensic Medicine’
<br/>—that is to say, the state of the law in former times and in
<br/>different countries. The mam object has been to afford re-
<br/>sults—general conclusions—in a word, to make a practical
<br/>and useful book.</p>
            <p>In discussing each subject, the author commences with a
<br/>brief account of the existing provisions of the law ; investiga-
<br/>ting, in the second place, under distinct heads, the principal
<br/>medical questions springing from the law, and appending
<br/>practical rules for medico-legal investigation. Throughout
<br/>the subjects are illustrated by cases.</p>
            <p>The American editor has corrected numerous errors existing
<br/>in the English work, and adapted the whole to the laws and
<br/>institutions of the United States. His additions (which are
<br/>very numerous and important) are distinguished from the
<br/>English text by being enclosed in brackets.</p>

<br/>position to sell this amount of reading matter for fifty cents.
<br/>Here are 700 pages, printed in close minion type, profuse-
<br/>ly interspersed with nonpareil, in double columns large oc-
<br/>tavo, on very good paper—and all for half a dollar! The
<br/>most astounding miracles of Mesmerism, if fairly examined,
<br/>would be found scarcely more really marvellous than this.</p>

           <p>We observe that unusual care has been taken in getting
<br/>up this edition. The typography is very correct, and the five
<br/>volumes bound or unbound, would form a valuable addition
<br/>to any library which chances to be without a copy of Scott’s
<br/>novels.</p>

            <div class="head">The Chronicles of Pineville. By the author of Major Jones’
Courtship, with twelve illustrations, engraved from original designs
by F. O. C. Darley. Philadelphia. Carey and Hart. 1845.</div>
            <p>It is still a disputed point among certain critics whether
<br/>America has produced a humorous writer, and we have
<br/>heard the author of the book before us cited as the best ex-
<br/>ample of a humorist that America can boast. But the Au-
<br/>thor of Major Jones’ Courtship is a comic rather than a hu-
<br/>morous writer. The merit of his sketches lies in their fidel-
<br/>ity to the scenes described, and not in their wit and humor.
<br/>The illustrations by Darley are the best of the kind that we
<br/>have seen in any American work, they are executed with
<br/>great freedom, and are very well as mere designs, but they
<br/>lack character, as they could not fail to do, since they were
<br/>not drawn from nature. They might be used to illustrate
<br/>tales of Michigan or Massachusetts life with as much propri-
<br/>ety as sketches of life in Georgia. In one of the illustrations
<br/>there is a stone cottage, and in another there is a row of
<br/>three story houses ; but we doubt the existence of such
<br/>things in Pineville. The cuts are executed with greater
<br/>neatness and beauty than we are accustomed to see in our
<br/>wood engravings, and they are exceedingly well printed.</p>

         <div class="head">THE MAGAZINES.</div>
          <p>The Lady’s Book for May has several very excellent papers—
<br/>among which the most valuable if not altogether the most interesting
<br/>is the “ European Correspondence” by Grund. Mr. Grund is one of
<br/>the most remarkable men we ever met,—possessing a wonderful facul-
<br/>ty of observation, and a memory which stands in little need of Profes-
<br/>sor Gouraud. His analytical power is also great, and as a critic few
<br/>men are entitled to greater consideration. Take as a specimen his
<br/>account of Kaulbach’s “Destruction of Jerusalem.”</p>
          <p>"Kaulbach, in his ‘ Destruction of Jerusalem,’ seizes not only on
<br/>an historical moment or catastrophe in the downfall of the Jews, but
<br/>on its poetical signification and its connection and relation to the hu-
<br/>man mind, which, after all, is the great laboratory of history. The
<br/>most accurate description of an event by an eye-witness is yet tar
<br/>from being an herodical account of the same, and so is the representa-
<br/>tion of an historical event far from being an historical picture. Kaul-
<br/>bach shows us the awful calamity of the destruction of the holy city
<br/>in its historical signification, in its relation to our religious conscious-
<br/>ness and to ourselves. The figures which he presents to the eye of
<br/>the beholder were never in life thus grouped together, and yet—his
<br/>painting is eminently historical.</p>
           <p>“ In the middle of the picture you see a group of dead bodies, dying
<br/>men and women, and some who, in their despair, attempt to destroy
<br/>themselves. This is the high priest, with his family; on both sides
<br/>and behind him you behold the cause of their distraction—the sources
<br/>of these rivers of blood. The Roman imperator enters in triumph the
<br/>holy city: the horrors of heathenism are planted on the altar of the
<br/>only living God ; the daughters of Zion are robbed : mothers, in des-
<br/>pair, attack their own flesh and blood ; and the people, in wild dis-
<br/>may, throng the streets leading to the temple of Jehovah, whose
<br/>burning columns threaten to bury them under its burning ruins. But
<br/>the painter, in producing this wild confusion, has introduced the unity
<br/>of design by the higher religious source from which these evils spring.
<br/>The religious faith of the world saw in the destruction of Jerusalem a
<br/>visitation of Divine Providence, which was expected as it was prophe-
<br/>sied. This idea is introduced into the picture by the angels with
<br/>burning swords which descend from Heaven, and the holy prophets
<br/>which are there enthroned. The destruction of the holy city, there-
<br/>fore, is an act of poetic justice—the last act of the Jewish drama
<br/>which reconciles the beholder to her fate. But. also, the relation of
<br/>the catastrophe to our own times is admirably indicated. It deprived<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>the people of Israel of their home : what remained of their faith was
<br/>doomed to endure the yoke of perpetual slavery. This fact the mid-
<br/>dle ages have dressed into the Story of ‘ The Wandering Jew;’ and
<br/>him, scourged by demons, the artist has introduced into his picture.
<br/>But what of the people of Israel belongs to the New Testament, des-
<br/>tined in the name of the Saviour to possess the world, our Christian
<br/>ancestors leave, under the guidance of angels, the burning town. This
<br/>group concludes the picture.</p>
              <p>“ The design is, us you may conclude from this description, con-
<br/>ceived in the most elevated and philosophical sense. It is, as regards
<br/>that conception, unique and unsurpassed by any work of art, ancient
<br/>or modern. The whole is. as it were, a picture in motion.”</p>
             <p>Miss Leslie continues her “ Bloxhams and Mayfields,” which loses
<br/>nothing of its interest as it proceeds. “La Cubana,” by the Poor
<br/>Scholar, has some passages of glowing poetry, intermingled with
<br/>some that are any thing else. “ The Gazelle ot the Menagerie,” by
<br/>Miss Gould is particularly happy, and so is the “ Horae Otiosae.”
<br/>The engravings are a mezzotint by Sadd, (Charles I. taking leave of
<br/>his children,) and a Mountish-looking design entitled “ The Recruit”
<br/>—engraved by Ellis.</p>
              <p>In the “Editors’ Book Table” there are some very just remarks on
<br/>the subject of taking out copyright for Magazines. It is really very
<br/>difficult to see how any one can, in conscience, object to such a course
<br/>on the part of Mess. Godey and Graham. To our apprehension a mere
<br/>statement of the facts of the case should stand in lieu of all argument.
<br/>It has been long the custom among the newspapers—the weeklies es-
<br/>pecially—to copy Magazine articles in full, and circulate them all over
<br/>the country—sometimes in advance of the magazines themselves. In
<br/>other words Godey and Graham have been at all the cost, while the
<br/>papers have enjoyed, if not all the advantage—at least the most im-
<br/>portant item of it—the origination of the articles. To such au extent
<br/>had this piracy been carried, that many magaziue subscribers ceased
<br/>to be euch, because they could procure all that was valuable in
<br/>these works from the newspapers very little later and often at less
<br/>cost, than from the magazines themselves.</p>
               <p>Graham’s Magazine for May is peculiarly rich in contributions.
<br/>Cooper’s sketch of Preble is worthy the best days of its author. Mrs.
<br/>Stephens’ “ Zuleica” is, also, an excellent article, and Grund's ‘ ‘ For-
<br/>eign Literary News” will be read with interest by all:—it is sadly dis-
<br/>figured, however, by typographical mistakes. We venture to correct
<br/>one or two of these, in copying the annexed exquisite ballad. It is
<br/>quoted by Mr. Grund from “ La Normandie Romanesque, Traditions,
<br/>Legendes et Superstitions Populaires de Cette Province.”</p>

          <p>In the review of the “ Spirit of the Age,” although “ Orion” is hear-

            <div class="head">THE CONCERT ROOM.
CONCERT OF THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.</div>
          <p>The last, and by far the worst Concert of the season, took place at
<br/>the Apollo Saloon on Saturday April 19th. The following is the pro-
<br/>gramme :</p>
            
           <div class="ab">

<br/>Overture, (Oberon.) -	Weber.</div>

           <p>The symphony by Beethoven is a wonderful composition. The
<br/>programme states that the subject is, or may be, supposed to be the
<br/>story of Orpheus and Eurydice ; whether such is the case or not, we
<br/>will not argue at present. Indeed, unless the composer himself states
<br/>his subject, we should, ourselves, always receive, with much caution,
<br/>any gratuitous elucidation, for music will so differently affect different
<br/>people, that what will appear perfectly natural, and in just accordance
<br/>with the refined feelings of some, would seem sheer raving and mad-
<br/>ness to others. It is true, that intellectual musical minds will but
<br/>rarely differ upon the true sentiment and meaning of a fine composi-
<br/>tion ; but as to its detail, no two will be found to agree, unless indeed
<br/>the composition be vocal.</p>
           <p>The performance of the first movement was slovenly in the extreme
<br/>It wanted precision, force, and clearness. We would merely quote
<br/>the mistake made by Mr. J. A. Kyle, to prove that even such orches-
<br/>tral excellence may have an exception. We would suggest to the con-
<br/>ductor, if one who follows where be should lead may be called so.
<br/>that when he meets with a p in his score, that its meaning is piano or
<br/>soft, and that two pp’s mean also soft, only more so. This will cer-
<br/>tainly be no news to him theoretically, but it would certainly astonish
<br/>his hearers, if he should by chanct give any practical evidence of his
<br/>knowledge. The Andante is truly an exquisite movement, but it was
<br/>badly played; there was a total want of delicacy in the performance<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>of the stringed instruments, (excepting the violoncelli, which were ad-
<br/>mirably handled) the violins scraped away unmercifully without taste
<br/>or expression, and in the short fugue towards the close, one half
<br/>seemed undetermined whether they were playing in the major or the
<br/>minor.</p>
            <p>The Allegretto or minuett and trio, was begun one half too fast so
<br/>the conductor immediately altered the time, and continued altering it
<br/>backward and forward, until he suited himself, which did not happen
<br/>we conclude, until after the movement finished.</p>
            <p>We would gladly expatiate upon the beauty and the peculiarity of
<br/>this movement, but we have a long notice before us and must refrain.</p>
            <p>For a description of the finale, we must refer our readers to the
<br/>printed description—it says that “ it will be found in many parts, the
<br/>very embodiment of mental distraction.” Gentle reader, this is per-
<br/>fectly true ; a more perfect picture—tone-picture—of mental distrac-
<br/>tion, we never listened to, but the author had less to do with it than
<br/>the conductor and the band. It was chaos, chaos—nothing but chaos !
<br/>It was a performance utterly disgraceful to a society of such preten-
<br/>sions, and one formed of such admirable materials. But the cause of
<br/>this is by no means difficult to arrive at. The society is made up of
<br/>cliques or cabals, composed of different nations; some of these parties
<br/>are a compound of two people of different birth places, who coalesce
<br/>for the purpose of keeping a third party from taking the lead; and it,
<br/>unfortunately, most frequently happens that the most worthy and effi-
<br/>cient member is sacrificed to a mean, paltry, narrow-minded, national
<br/>and party jealousy or prejudice, while in his stead is placed a man in-
<br/>capable of filling the office with any credit to himself or the society.
<br/>Not only does this illiberal feeling exist and act within the society it-
<br/>self, but it operates to the exclusion of good, efficient, and necessary
<br/>members; so jealous is each party, lest the new member should in-
<br/>crease the number of its antagonists. We have repeatedly urged upon
<br/>the society the necessity of increasing its force in violins; and every
<br/>member who knows anything, will accede to the justice of the remark;
<br/>and yet we know of at least one case, where an excellent violin player,
<br/>firm, powerful and talented, was proposed, but black-balled by the
<br/>party in power, for no other possible reason than that he was not of
<br/>their party. This is a state of things which cannot but prove fatal to
<br/>the very existence of the society, it persisted in.</p>
            <p>The fatal effects of its operation is plainly to be traced in the evident
<br/>deterioration of the performances. The members arc the same; we
<br/>must conclude that they have not lost any of their mechanical ability !
<br/>How then can we account for this deterioration, otherwise than in the
<br/>operation of these powerful cliques, which has resulted in the frequent
<br/>election of a conductor whom we distinctly assert to be incompetent
<br/>to the office. We cannot believe that after exposing himself to the
<br/>smiles of every musician present at the Philharmonic Concert on Sa-
<br/>turday last, we cannot believe, we say, that Mr. U. C. Hill will ever
<br/>attempt to wield the conductor’s baton in that society again ; or if he
<br/>would, we cannot believe that he will ever be permitted so to do. We
<br/>do not believe the professional experience of any individual member,
<br/>can furnish a parallel to such misleadings, and if the party feelings of
<br/>the members have not blinded them to the certain fatal results of their
<br/>conduct, we may yet hope to see a beneficial change.</p>
            <p>Madame Otto sang two songs, one German and the other Italian.
<br/>The remarks we have made upon this lady’s pronunciation of the En-
<br/>glish language, will apply with double force to her Italian singing. It
<br/>would be difficult, indeed, from the pronunciation, to fix upon any par.
<br/>ticular language as the one in which she sung. Madame Otto is fool-
<br/>ishly advised in the selection of her music. The songs she sings
<br/>are generally beyond her power of execution ; requiring many qualifi.
<br/>cations which she does not possess—thorough musical education, feel-
<br/>ing, taste, and flexibility of voice.</p>
            <p>We have at least done some good by our remarks on these Concerts
<br/>The method of accompanying the vocal music which we have so un-
<br/>sparingly condemned, has given place to a more careful execution. In
<br/>this Madame Otto hud an advantage never before afforded a singer at
<br/>these concerts.</p>
            <p>Hummel’s piano-forte piece was the gem of the evening. It cannot
<br/>be called strictly a piano piece, as no effect could be given to it with-
<br/>out the assistance of the orchestra. It is descriptive of the wander,
<br/>ings of the French knight Sir Huon, as described in the fairy tale of
<br/>Oberon or the Charmed Horn. It is replete with beauties, and is pro-
<br/>bably one of the most happily conceived descriptive pieces ever put
<br/>u a paper. The Tempesta di Mare (Sea Storm) becomes truly sub-
<br/>lime in its vraisemblance; the last movement, however, delighted us
<br/>the most. Its theme is the Indian air introduced by Weber into his
<br/>opera of Oberon. The ingenuity with which this is worked out in a
<br/>thousand different ways, while brilliantly accompanied on the piano<div class="pagebreak" id="#page270"/>
            <br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>is worthy particular notice. The orchestral arrangements are exqui-
<br/>site in their effects from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>Mr. Timm’s performance was distinguished by a fine appreciation
<br/>of his author, discriminating taste, delicacy, precision and exquisite
<br/>finish. We always feel a pure and unalloyed enjoyment in listening to
<br/>this gentleman’s playing; we have certainly met many who can do
<br/>more to astonish us, but Mr. Timm satisfies our judgment, and fills
<br/>our mind with a perfect embodiment of the beautiful conceptions of
<br/>the composer.</p>
            <p>Mendelssohn’s overture, Melusine, was performed for the first time
<br/>in the country, but no justice was done to it. The countless delicate
<br/>and beautiful points, the developement of which depend upon the in-
<br/>ward perception of their importance by the conductor, were hidden,
<br/>overlooked, or never known.</p>
            <p>The overture to Oberon was the best orchestral performance of the
<br/>evening, but the effect was in a great measure marred by a want of
<br/>power in the violins—they were altogether too weak. There was an
<br/>error in the time of the first movement. We saw Weber conduct it,
<br/>from the first rehearsal in the Saloon at Covent Garden Theatre, to
<br/>the last rehearsal in the orchestra. He always made an accellerando
<br/>after the eighth bar of the opening movement. This would suggest
<br/>itself to any one studying it carefully, for otherwise the movement
<br/>would be dragging in the extreme.</p>
            <p>With this overture concluded a concert very unsatisfactory in its re-
<br/>sults, as a performance : the materials were good, but they were mar-
<br/>red by incompetency and want of care.</p>

           <p>The taste for vocal music is spreading over the country most rapid-
<br/>ly ; it is rooting itself firmly wherever four voices can be found to
<br/>mingle in its practice. Vocal part-music is practiced in our cities to
<br/>an extent scarcely to be believed by those who only know of music
<br/>by attending the fashionable public concerts. There are many hun-
<br/>dreds of young men, in New York alone, who, instead of wasting their
<br/>time over the billiard table or dominoe box, meet together and devote
<br/>two or three evenings every week to the study of glee singing, and re-
<br/>ceive a rich reward in the delight experienced from the pleasant social
<br/>intercourse and musical banquets which such meetings afford. No
<br/>one will deny but that this promises well for the social and intellectu-
<br/>al improvement of the people ; nor will any one deny that music may
<br/>be made, by judicious fostering and enlightened encouragement, a pow-
<br/>erful auxiliary in ameliorating the social wants in every circle of soci-
<br/>ety.</p>
           <p>Music excited no inconsiderable attention among the ancients.
<br/>They were fully impressed by the importance of the subject, not only
<br/>as a branch of educational accomplishment, but as a moral force which
<br/>might be wielded with powerful effect for the benefit of the people.
<br/>Even as far back as Polybius, music was considered of the most vital
<br/>importance in the education of youth, in all the ceremonies of state,
<br/>and also in the religious rites of the church. Speaking of its power
<br/>he says—“ Nor can it be supposed that the Lacedemonians and An-
<br/>cient Cretans were not influenced by some good reason, when, in the
<br/>place of trumpets, they introduced the sound of flutes and the har-
<br/>mony of verse to animate their soldiers in the time of battle ; or that
<br/>the first Arcadians acted without some strong necessity, who, though
<br/>their lives and manners, in all other points, were rigid and austere, in-
<br/>corporate this art into the very essence of their government; and obliged
<br/>not their children only, but the young men likewise, till they had
<br/>gained the age of thirty years, to persist in its constant study and
<br/>practice." Most of the other ancient writers, spoke equally in its fa-
<br/>vor, and recommended it upon every occasion.</p>
            <p>It is not strange, therefore, that we should hail with unfeigned plea-
<br/>sure, the unmistakable evidence of the rapid growth of this delightful
<br/>art in the affections of the people.</p>
            <p>If any other evidence were wanting to prove the correctness of our
<br/>position, the mere fact of the publication of so many works devoted
<br/>to vocal part-music, would be sufficient. Quite a number of Glee
<br/>Books, re-published from English and German copies, have appeared
<br/>in New York, and as far as we have seen, these are superior to any
<br/>others published in the United Slates in respect to selection, form, and<br/>
            <div class="columnbreak"/>
            <br/>convenient arrangement. We allude particularly to the collection
<br/>published by S. O. Dyer, 385 Hudson st., one volume of which has al-
<br/>ready appeared, and another is in course of publication in monthly num-
<br/>bers.</p>
            <p>The little book before us is simple and unpretending in its character,
<br/>and contains many agreeable and pleasing pieces. They are, chiefly,
<br/>selections from the best English writers, with some German and Ital-
<br/>ian compositions. Among the composers we find the names of Doc-
<br/>tors Arne, Callcott, Greene, and Hayes, J. Stafford Smith, Handel,
<br/>Marcells, Neukomm, Rossini, Bellini, Barnett, Herold, Auber and
<br/>Mendelssohn, with several others. Mr. Paine has contributed several
<br/>of his own compositions, but anxious as we are to judge mildly, we
<br/>must say that the collection would have been beautified if these had
<br/>been omitted, they are so entirely common place and wanting in origi-
<br/>nality. One very prominent defect in this work, is the constant occur-
<br/>rence of false accentuation. In some places the words cannot be sung
<br/>as written, without making positive nonsense. Take for instance the
<br/>song—“ Woods in Winter,” in bars one and four, second line, p. 126,
<br/>where the second syllable of the word upland, falls upon the accented
<br/>beat of the bar, and the first syllabic of the word embracing, also up-
<br/>on the accented beat. We could multiply these instances, almost
<br/>without number, had we the space to spare. In arranging pieces Mr.
<br/>Paine has taken too many liberties with his author; in the following
<br/>pieces for instance ; When the moonlight streaming, Frendair, and the
<br/>Hunters Signal Horn, by A. Lee, he has omitted entire the second
<br/>part of the first, thus effectually divesting it of its meaning, and has
<br/>omitted from the second, the concluding portions of the two first
<br/>strains. This is altogether a needless curtailment, and is very bad
<br/>taste. In the Widow’s Reply, composed by David Paine, in the fourth
<br/>and fifth bars, page 73, the A flat in the accompaniment, should each
<br/>time be sharps. Such errors betray a negligence truly reprehensible.</p>
            <p>The Book however really contains many valuable pieces of Music—
<br/>some to suit all classes—the grave, the gay, the pious, and the senti-
<br/>mental. It is bound in a neat cover, and is altogether got out in very
<br/>excellent style.</p>

               <div class="head">STODART &amp; DUNHAM'S PIANO FORTES.</div>
               <p>We have spoken at length upon the manufacture of Piano Fortes,
<br/>as exhibited at the factory of Messrs. Stodart &amp; Dunham. We did not
<br/>go into the subject quite as thoroughly as we could have wished, from
<br/>the want of space, but we may have occasion to refer to it again by
<br/>and bye, and shall be able then to bring some obscure points into
<br/>strong relief.</p>
               <p>We have not as yet reported upon the quality of the instruments
<br/>turned out from this factory, not because we had little to say, but be-
<br/>cause we thought it better to defer that portion until the concluding
<br/>notice.</p>
               <p>Although all Piano Fortes would appear to a common observer to be
<br/>precisely alike in construction, and although the process of manufac-
<br/>ture is universally similar, yet the results depend so entirely upon a
<br/>combination of circumstances, that if two instruments be manufactured
<br/>from the same material, upon the same scale, and by the same hands,
<br/>they will be found, in all probability, when completed, to be totally
<br/>different in quality, and yet no one could discover the slightest dissimi-
<br/>larity in any portion of the workmanship. It will scarcely be credited,
<br/>but it is nevertheless a fact, that there are the enormous number of five
<br/>thousand three hundred and fifteen pieces in every Piano Forte of a
<br/>large scale. The number seems truly immense, but the small items
<br/>count up rap dly.</p>
               <p>The aim of every maker is to produce as much tone of a certain qua-
<br/>lity, as rapidly and with as little labor to the performer as possible. It
<br/>is in this particular that each maker differs from the other. Some by
<br/>a light touch, and a hammer covered in a particular way, produce a
<br/>quality metallic and brilliant, and some by a powerful lever, a hammer
<br/>loosely covered, and a badly made spring, produce a wooden, or as it
<br/>is called, a tubby quality of tone, and this class has the peculiarity,
<br/>that though the keys be struck never so hard, no more sound can be
<br/>obtained ; while other makers endeavor to form such a scale (the form
<br/>by which the strings are adjusted on the instrument) and to regulate
<br/>the lever to such a nicety, that the medium power of the finger will pro-
<br/>duce a rich, full, and powerful tone, while an increase of power appli-
<br/>ed to the keys, will give an increase of tone of the same quality. These
<br/>in our opinion, have a decided advantage, for though use imparts a
<br/>brilliancy to them, their tone is not so apt to wear thin and wiry, as is
<br/>the case with those which are brilliant when new.</p>
               <p>Of the latter class are Messrs. Stodart &amp; Dunham’s instruments.
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page271"/>
                  <br/>
                  <div class="columnbreak"/>
                  <br/>They are full bodied, rich toned Pianos, with a touch so elastic that
<br/>it springs to the finger, and a clear, melodious and ringing sound,
<br/>which may almost be called vocal. The tone does not come out slug-
<br/>gishly, but is simultaneous with the stroke of the hammer, and in this
<br/>respect, we consider that they have, in their recent instruments, effect-
<br/>ed a decided improvement. Of the workmanship, both of the interior
<br/>and exterior of the instruments, we are enabled through ocular de-
<br/>monstration, to speak in terms of entire satisfaction, for we have seen
<br/>every part of the manufacture, and know it to be solid, faithful, and
<br/>masterly handicraft.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, we feel assured that whoever purchases an instrument
<br/>from the store of Stodart &amp; Dunham, will never repent the bargain.</p>
               <p>To the gentlemanly and obliging proprietors we have to express our
<br/>thanks for their considerate patience under all our troublesome inqui-
<br/>ries.</p>

<br/>pied. This is as it ought to be. We enjoy one great blessing in Ameri-

<br/>Mr. Goldsmith’s high qualifications as a teacher, it is unnecessary to
<br/>say a word. His “ Gems of Penmanship” speak at least one large vol-

<br/>measure, by effective delivery and grace of gesture. He comprehends,
<br/>we think, the whole rationale of elocution as well as any man of his
<br/>time, and his physical powers enable him to give effect to his concep-
<br/>tions. We shall look with much interest tor a work on Elocution
<br/>which we understand he is preparing.</p>
               <p>His lectures at the Society Library have been well attended, and

<br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
<br/>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<br/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<br/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<br/>otherwise are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<br/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will been
<br/>abled to also music with facility, and at the tame time become good musi
<br/>cians.
<br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
<br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
<br/>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-

<br/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the

            <div class="ab">VANDENHOFF’S ELOCUTION.
<br/>A PLAIN SYSTEM OF ELOCUTION: OR, LOGI-
<br/>cal and Musical Reading and Declamation, with Exercises in Prose and
<br/>Verse, distinctly marked for the guidance of the Ear and Voice of the Pupil:
<br/>o which is added, AN APPENDIX, containing a copious Practice in Orator-
<br/>ical, Poetical, and Dramatic Reading and Recitation: the whole forming a
<br/>Complete Speaker, well adapted to private pupils, classes, and the use of
<br/>schools; by G. Vandenhoff, Professor of Elocution in the City of New
<br/>York. Second Edition.	Published by C. SHEPARD,
<br/>191 Broadway, opposite John st.
<br/>From the Rev. R. T. Huddart, (Classical Academy, Houston street.)
<br/>It affords me much pleasure to add my testimony to the value, importance,
<br/>and advantage of Mr. George Vandenhoff’s Work on Elocution. He has
<br/>aptly styled it “ a plain System:” such it truly is to those who will pursue
<br/>the instruction given, step by step; and cannot fail of producing a beneficial
<br/>and much wished for result in one of the departments of education so sadly
<br/>neglected—correct reading—devoid of vulgarities, and errors in articulation
<br/>and pronunciation. I hope the book will have a wide circulation, in order
<br/>that the good which it is capable of effecting may be thus more extensively
<br/>diffused, and a better system of instruction be afforded to the rising genera-
<br/>tion. in that which constitutes a mist agreeable accomplishment in every
<br/>gentleman’s education, namely, “ Logical and Musical Declamation.”

<br/>From Mrs. Lawrence, (Academy, Stuyvesant Place.)
<br/>1 have great pleasure in stating, that Mr. G. Vandenhoff’s work on Elocu-
<br/>tion has been used with so much success in my school, that I can safely re-
<br/>commend it to all, who may desire improvement in that elegant branch of
<br/>education ; as the most simple, clear and concise treatise on the subject ; and
<br/>well adapted to the comprehension of any mind.

<br/>From Jacob La Roy, Esq., (Lafayette Place.)
<br/>Mr. Vandenhoff's Treatise on Elocution has been used by a Class of La-
<br/>dies at my house, and has been found in every way adapted to produce its
<br/>intended effect.	(Signed)	Jacob Le Roy.
