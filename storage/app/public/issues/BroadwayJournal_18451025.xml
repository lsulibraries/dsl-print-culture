         <div class="ab">Truth is stranger than Action.—Old Saying.</div>
         <p>Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some
<br/>oriental investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsӧor-
<br/>not, a work which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides)
<br/>is scarcely known at all, even in Europe, and which has
<br/>never been quoted to my knowledge, by any American—
<br/>if we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of
<br/>American Literature —having had occasion, I say, to
<br/>turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very remark-
<br/>able work, I was not a little astonished to discover that
<br/>the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error
<br/>respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Schehera-
<br/>zade, as that fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights,”
<br/>and that the dénoument there given, if not altogether in-
<br/>accurate, as far as it goes, is at least to blame in not hav-
<br/>ing gone very much farther.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For full information on this interesting topic, I must
<br/>refer the inquisitive reader to the “Isitsoornot" itself:
<br/>but, in the mean time, I shall be pardoned for giving a
<br/>summary of what I there discovered.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It will be remembered that, in the usual version of
<br/>the tales, a certain monarch, having good cause to be
<br/>jealous of his queen, not only puts her to death, but makes
<br/>a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to espouse each
<br/>night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and
<br/>the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter,
<br/>and with a religious punctuality and method that confer-
<br/>red great credit upon him as a man of devout feelings
<br/>and excellent sense, he was interrupted one afternoon (no
<br/>doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to
<br/>Whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.</p>
         <p>Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that
she would either redeem the land from the depopulating
tax upon its beauty, or perish, after the approved fashion
of all heroines, in the attempt.
</p>
         <p>Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-
<br/>year, (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious,) she
<br/>deputes her father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to
<br/>the king of her hand. This hand the king eagerly ac-
<br/>cepts—(he had intended to take it at all events, and had
<br/>put off the matter from day to day, only through fear of
<br/>the vizier)—but, in accepting it now, he gives all parties
<br/>very distinctly to understand that, grand vizier or no
<br/>grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of giving up
<br/>one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,
<br/>the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,
<br/>and did actually marry him despite her father’s excellent
<br/>advice not to do anything of the kind—when she would
<br/>and did marry him, I say, will I nill I, it was with her
<br/>beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of
<br/>the case would allow.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had
<br/>been reading Machiavelli, beyond doubt,) had a very in-
<br/>genious little plot in her mind. On the night of the wed-
<br/>ding she contrived, upon I forget what specious pretenee,
<br/>to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of
<br/>the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to
<br/>bed; and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to
<br/>awaken the good monarch, her husband, (who bore her
<br/>none the worse will because he intended to wring her
<br/>neck on the morrow,)—she managed to awaken him, I
<br/>say, (although, on account of a capital conscience and
<br/>an easy digestion, he slept well,) by the profound interest
<br/>of a story (about a rat and a black cat, I think,) which
<br/>she was narrating (all in an under-tone, of course,) to her
<br/>sister. When the day broke, it so happened that this
<br/>history was not altogether finished, and that Schehera-
<br/>zade, in the nature of things, could not finish it just then,
<br/>since it was high time for her to get up and be bow-
<br/>strung—a thing a very little more pleasant than hanging,
<br/>only a trifle more genteel.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry
<br/>to say, even over his sound religious principles, induced
<br/>him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow un-
<br/>til next morning, for the purpose and with the hope of
<br/>hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black
<br/>cat (a black cat I think it was) and the rat.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The night having arrived, however, the lady Schehe-
<br/>razade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat
<br/>and the rat, (the rat was blue,) but before she well
<br/>knew what she was about, found herself deep in the in-
<br/>tricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not
<br/>altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings)
<br/>that went, in a violet manner, by clock-work, and was
<br/>wound up with an indigo key. With this history the
<br/>king was even more profoundly interested than with the
<br/>other, and as the day broke before its conclusion, (not-
<br/>withstanding all the queen’s endeavours to get through
<br/>with it in time for the bowstringing,) there was again no</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page236"/>
         </p>
         <p>resource but to postpone that ceremony as before, for
<br/>twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a
<br/>similar accident with a similar result; and then the
<br/>next—and then again the next; so that, in the end, the
<br/>good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all
<br/>opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less
<br/>than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it alto-
<br/>gether by the expiration of this time or gets himself ab-
<br/>solved of it in the regular way, or, (what is more pro-
<br/>bable) breaks it outright as well as the head of his father
<br/>confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being li-
<br/>neally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the
<br/>whole seven baskets of talk which the latter lady, we
<br/>all know, picked up from under the trees in the garden
<br/>of Eden—Scheherazade, I say, finally triumphed, and the
<br/>tariff upon beauty was repealed.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we
<br/>have it upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and
<br/>pleasant—but, alas! like a great many pleasant things,
<br/>is more pleasant than true ; and I am indebted altogether
<br/>to the “Isitsdӧornot” for the means of correcting the er-
<br/>ror. “Le mieux," says a French proverb, “est l'ennemi
<br/>du bien," and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had in-
<br/>herited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added
<br/>that she put them out at compound interest until they
<br/>amounted to seventy-seven.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand and sec-
<br/>ond night, [I quote the language of the Isitsoornot, at
<br/>this point, verbatim,] “my dear sister,” said she, “now
<br/>that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has
<br/>blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily re-
<br/>pealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscre-
<br/>tion in withholding from you and the king (who I am
<br/>sorry to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do)
<br/>the full conclusion of the history of Sinbad the sailor.
<br/>This person went through numerous other and more in-
<br/>teresting adventures than those which I related; but the
<br/>truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their nar-
<br/>ration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a
<br/>greivous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that
<br/>Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to
<br/>remedy my great neglect, and as soon as I have given
<br/>the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far
<br/>that he may stop making that horrible noise, I will
<br/>forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases.) with the
<br/>sequel of this very remarkable story.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from
<br/>the “Isitsӧornot,” expressed no very particular intensity
<br/>of gratification; but the king having been sufficiently
<br/>pinched, at length ceased snoring, and finally said
<br/>“hum!” and then “hoo!” when the queen understand-
<br/>ing these words, (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify
<br/>that he was all attention, and would do his best not to
<br/>snore any more,—the queen, I say, having arranged these
<br/>matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into
<br/>the history of Sinbad the sailor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“‘At length in my old age,’ [these are the words of
<br/>Sinbad himself, as retailed by Scheherazade,]—‘at
<br/>length, in my old age, and after enjoying many years
<br/>of tranquility at home, I became once more possessed
<br/>with a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day,
<br/>without acquainting any of my family with my design, I
<br/>packed up some bundles of such merchandize as was
<br/>most precious and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to
<br/>carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to
<br/>await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey
<br/>me out of the kingdom into some region which I had not
<br/>as yet explored.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we
<br/>sat down beneath some trees and looked out into the
<br/>ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship, but during seve-
<br/>al hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied
<br/>that I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound,
<br/>and the porter, after listening awhile, declared that he
<br/>also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and
<br/>then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that
<br/>the object which caused it was approaching us. At
<br/>length, on the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black
<br/>speck, which rapidly increased in size until we made it
<br/>out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part
<br/>of its body above the surface of the sea. It came to-
<br/>wards us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge
<br/>waves of foam around its breast, and illuminating all
<br/>that part of the sea through which it passed, with a long
<br/>line of fire that extended far off into the distance.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly.
<br/>Its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees
<br/>that grow, and it was as wide as the great hall of audi-
<br/>ence in your palace, O most sublime and munificent of the
<br/>Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary
<br/>fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness
<br/>throughout all that portion of it which floated above the
<br/>water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak
<br/>that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated
<br/>beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a
<br/>glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with
<br/>the billows, was entirely covered with metallic scales, of
<br/>a colour like that of the moon in misty weather. The
<br/>back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extend-
<br/>ed upwards six spines, about half the length of the whole
<br/>body.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could
<br/>perceive; but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was
<br/>provided with ar least four score of eyes, that protruded
<br/>from their sockets like those of the green dragon-fly, and
<br/>were arranged all around the body in two rows, one
<br/>above the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak,
<br/>which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow.
<br/>Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger
<br/>than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>" ‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before
<br/>said, with the greatest rapidity, it must have been
<br/>moved altogether by necromancy—for it had neither fins
<br/>like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like the
<br/>sea-shell which is blown along in the manner of a ves-
<br/>sel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels.
<br/>Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike, only,
<br/>not far from the latter, were two small holes that served
<br/>for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out
<br/>its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a
<br/>shrieking disagreeable noise.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very
<br/>great; but it was even surpassed by our astonishment
<br/>when, upon getting a nearer look, we perceived upon
<br/>the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the
<br/>size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling
<br/>them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),
<br/>being supplied (by nature no doubt) with an ugly, uncom-
<br/>fortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so
<br/>tight to the skin as to render the poor wretches laugh-
<br/>ably awkward and put them apparently to severe pain.
<br/>On the very tips of their heads were certain square-look-
<br/>ing boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have
<br/>been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discover-
<br/>ed that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I
<br/>therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page237"/>
         </p>
         <p>their great weight, to keep the heads of the animals
<br/>steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around the necks
<br/>of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of
<br/>servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only
<br/>much wider and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite im-
<br/>possible for these poor victims to move their heads in
<br/>any direction without moving the body at the same time;
<br/>and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation
<br/>of their noses—a view puggish and snubby in a wonder-
<br/>ful, if not positively in an awful degree.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore
<br/>where we stood, it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes
<br/>to a great extent, and emitted from it a terrible flash of
<br/>fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke and a noise
<br/>that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the
<br/>smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd man-animals
<br/>standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet
<br/>in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he
<br/>presently addressed us in loud, harsh and disagreeable ac-
<br/>cents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for lan-
<br/>guage had they not come altogether through the nose.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss
<br/>how to reply, as I could in no manner understand what
<br/>was said; and in this difficulty I turned to the porter,
<br/>who was near swooning through affright, and demanded
<br/>of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was,
<br/>what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were
<br/>that so swarmed upon its back. To this the porter re-
<br/>plied, as well as he could for trepidation, that he had
<br/>once before heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel
<br/>demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, cre-
<br/>ated by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon
<br/>mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin,
<br/>such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little
<br/>larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their
<br/>uses, however evil—for, through the torture they caused
<br/>the beast by their nibblings and stingings, it was goad-
<br/>ed into that degree of wrath which was requiste to make
<br/>it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and ma-
<br/>licious designs of the wicked genii.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘This account determined me to take to my heels,
<br/>and, without once even looking behind me, I ran at full
<br/>speed up into the hills, while the porter ran equally fast,
<br/>although nearly in an opposite direction, so that, by
<br/>these means, he finally made his escape with my bun-
<br/>dles, of which I have no doubt he took excellent care
<br/>although this is a point I cannot determine, as I do not
<br/>remember that I ever beheld him again.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>" 'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of
<br/>the men-vermin (who had come to the shore in boats)
<br/>that I was very soon overtaken, bound hand and foot,
<br/>and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out
<br/>again into the middle of the sea.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ ‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitiing a com-
<br/>fortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this;
<br/>but regret being useless, I made the best of my condition
<br/>and exerted myself to secure the good-will of the man-
<br/>animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to ex-
<br/>ercise authority over its fellows. I succeeded so well in
<br/>this endeavour that, in a few days, the creature bestow-
<br/>ed upon me various tokens of its favour, and, in the end,
<br/>even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of
<br/>what it was vain enough to denominate its language ; so
<br/>that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily,
<br/>and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire I had
<br/>of seeing the world.</p>
         <p>“ ‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle,
</p>
         <p>grunt unt grumble, hiss, Jiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one
<br/>day after dinner—but I beg a thousand pardons, I had
<br/>forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the
<br/>dialect of the Cock-neighs, (so the man-animals were
<br/>called; I presume because their language formed the
<br/>connecting link between that of the horse and that of
<br/>the rooster.) With your permission, I will translate.
<br/>‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am
<br/>happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a very
<br/>excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which
<br/>is called circumnavigating the globe; and since you are
<br/>so desirous of seeing the world, I will strain a point and
<br/>give you a free passage upon the back of the beast'’”
<br/>When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far,
<br/>relates the “Isitsӧornot,” the king turned over from his
<br/>left side to his right, and said—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“It is, in fact, very suprising, my dear queen, that you
<br/>omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do
<br/>you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and
<br/>strange?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the
<br/>fair Scheherazade resumed her history in the following
<br/>words:—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Sinbad went on in this manner, with his narrative to
<br/>the caliph—‘ I thanked the man-animal for its kindness,
<br/>and soon found myself very much at home on the beast,
<br/>which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;
<br/>although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the
<br/>world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so
<br/>that we went—so to say—either up hill or down hill all
<br/>the time.’”</p>
         <p>“That, I think, was very singular.” interrupted the
king.
“Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Schehera-
zade.
“I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; but, pray, be
so good as to go on with the story.”
</p>
         <p>“I will,” said the queen. ‘The beast,’ continued
<br/>Sinbad to the caliph, ‘ swam, as I have related, up hill
<br/>and down hill, until, at length, we arrived at an island,
<br/>many hundreds of miles in circumference, but which,
<br/>nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea
<br/>by a colony of little things like caterpillars.’ ”*</p>
         <p>“Hum!” said the king.
</p>
         <p>“ ‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Schehera-
<br/>zade, it must be understood, took no notice of her hus-
<br/>band’s ill-mannered ejaculation)—‘ leaving this island,
<br/>we came to another where the forests were of solid
<br/>stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-
<br/>tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut them
<br/>down.’ ”†</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade,
<br/>paying him no attention, continued in the language of
<br/>Sinbad.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ 'Passing beyond this last island, we reached a coun-
<br/>try where there was a cave that ran to the distance of
<br/>thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth, and</p>
         <p>*The coralites.
</p>
         <p>† "One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is
<br/>a petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of
<br/>several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone.
<br/>Some trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling
<br/>fact for natural philosophers, and most cause them to modify the
<br/>existing theory of petrifaction.”—Kennedy. This account, at first
<br/>discredited, has since been corroborated by the discovery of a com-
<br/>pletely petrified forest, near the head-waters of the Chayenne, or
<br/>Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of the Rocky
<br/>chain.</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page638"/>
         </p>
         <p>that contained a greater number of far more spacious'and
<br/>more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all Da-
<br/>mascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces
<br/>there hung myriads of gems, like diamonds, but larger
<br/>than men; and in among the streets of towers and pyra-
<br/>mids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black
<br/>as ebony and swarming with fish that had no eyes.’”*</p>
         <p>"Hum!” said the king.
</p>
         <p>" 'We then swam into a region of the sea where we
<br/>found a lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed
<br/>torrents of melted metal, some of which were twelve
<br/>miles wide and sixty miles long;† while from an abyss
<br/>on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of ashes that
<br/>the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and
<br/>it became darker than the darkest midnight; so that,
<br/>when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fif-
<br/>ty miles from the mountain, it was impossible to see
<br/>the whitest object, however close we held it to our
<br/>eyes.” ’‡</p>
         <p>"Hum!” said the king.
</p>
         <p>" ‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his
<br/>voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of
<br/>things seem reversed—for we here saw a great lake, at

<br/>arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole
<br/>world. Through it there meandered a glorious river for
<br/>several thousands of miles. This river was of unspeak-
<br/>able depth, and of a transparency richer than that of
<br/>amber. It was from three to six miles in width; and
<br/>its banks, which arose on either side to twelve hundred
<br/>feet in perpendicular height, were crowned with ever-
<br/>blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers
<br/>that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but
<br/>the name of this luxuriant land was the kindom of Hor-

<br/>dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel

         <p>Mr. J. II. Williams, of Salem, Mass., presented the “ National
<br/>Institute,” with an insect from New Zealand, with the following
<br/>description:—“ 'The Hotte,’ a decided caterpiller, or worm, is found
<br/>growing at the foot of the Rata tree, with a plant growing out of
<br/>its head. This most peculiar and most extraordinary insect travels
<br/>up both the Rata and Perriri trees, and entering into the top, eats
<br/>its way, perforating the trunk of the tree until it reaches the root, it
<br/>then comes out of the root, and dies, or remains dormant, and the
<br/>plant propagates out of its head; the body remains perfect and en-
<br/>tire, of a harder substance than when alive. From this insect the
<br/>natives make a coloring for tatooing.”</p>

         <p>11 “The corolla of this flower, (Aristolochia Clemalitis,) which is
<br/>tubular, but terminating upwards in a lingulae limb, is inflated into
<br/>a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset
<br/>with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains
<br/>the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together
<br/>with the surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter
<br/>than even the germen, cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it
<br/>upon the stigma, as the flower stands always upright till after im-
<br/>pregnation. And hence, without some additional and peculiar aid,
<br/>the pollen must necessarily fall down to the bottom of the flower.
<br/>Now, the aid that Nature has furnished in this case, is that of the
<br/>Tipvta Pennirornis, a small insect, which, entering the tube of the
<br/>corolla in quest of honey, descends to the bottom, and rumages
<br/>about till it becomes quite covered with pollen; but, not being able
<br/>to force its way out again, owing to the downward position of the
<br/>hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap,
<br/>and being somewhat impatient of its confinement, it brushes back-
<br/>wards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly tra-
<br/>versing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impreg-
<br/>nation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop
<br/>and the hairs to shrink to the side of the tube, effecting an easy pas
<br/>sage for the escape of the insect.”—Rev. P. Keith—“ Sydom of

<br/>upon the spot—the one by the bees, and the other by the
<br/>birds; but the king keeping their solutions a secret, it
<br/>was only after the most profound researches and labor,
<br/>and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long
<br/>series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length

<br/>found ourselves close upon another, from whose shores
<br/>there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in

<br/>although they flew a mile during every minute, it re-
<br/>quired no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass 
<br/>over us—in which there were several millions of millions </p>
         <p>of fowls.’ ”†
“Oh fy!” said the king.
</p>
         <p>“ 'No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which oc- 
<br/>casioned us great annoyance, than we were terrified by
<br/>the appearance of a fowl of another kind, and infinitely lar-
<br/>ger than even the rocs which I met in my former voya-
<br/>ges; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes up-
<br/>on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This
<br/>terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive, but
<br/>was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodi-
<br/>gious fatness and roundness, of a soft looking substance,
<br/>smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its
<br/>talons, the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the
<br/>heavens, a house from which it had knocked off the roof,
<br/>and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human
<br/>beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful
<br/>despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We
<br/>shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening
<br/>the bird into letting go of its prey; but it merely gave a
<br/>snort or puff, as if of rage, and then let fall upon our
<br/>heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand.’ ”</p>

<br/>volution.” This is an excessively complex problem; for it is, in 
<br/>other words, to find the best possible position at an infinity of varied
<br/>distances, and at an infinity of points on the arm. There were a
<br/>thousand futile attempts to answer the query on the part of the most
<br/>illustrious mathematicians; and when, at length, an undeniable
<br/>solution was discovered, men found that the wings of a bird had

         <p>“'We passed immediately beneath this continent,
<br/>(swimming in between the legs of the cow,) and, after
<br/>some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful country in-
<br/>deed, which, I was informed by the man animal, was his
<br/>own native land, inhabited by things of his own species.
<br/>This elevated the man animal very much in my esteem;
<br/>and in fact, I now began to feel ashamed of the con-
<br/> temptuous familiarity with which I had treated him;</p>
         <p/>
         <p> for I found that the man-animals in general were a na-
<br/>tion of the most powerful magicians, who lived with
<br/>worms in their brains,† which, no doubt, served to stim-
<br/>ulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to
<br/> the most miraculous efforts of imagination.’ ”</p>
         <p>“Nonsense!” said the king.
</p>
         <p>“ ‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several
<br/>animals of very singular kinds; for example, there was
<br/>a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood
<br/>was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black stones
<br/>for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he
<br/>was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more
<br/>weighty than the grandest temple in this city, at a rate
<br/>surpassing that of the flight of most birds.’ ”</p>
         <p>“Twattle!” said the king.

         <p>" 'I saw, also, among these people a hen without feath-
<br/>ers, but bigger than a camel; instead of flesh and bone
<br/>she had iron and brick; her blood, like that of the horse,
<br/>(to whom in fact she was nearly related,) was boiling
<br/>water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black
<br/>stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hun-
<br/>dred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they took up
<br/>their residenco for several weeks within the stomach of
<br/>their mother.’ ”‡</p>

Often, in dream and reverie,
There came unto her charmed ear,
With words of power and prophecy,
Voices from a sublimer sphere.
Forth from the chambers of the night—
From the dim deeps of wave and air,
Marvels and mysteries of might

<br/>lous). So Gen. Macbeth would seem to have thought,
<br/>when his way of life went down among blasted leaves;
<br/>and in his progresses and fortunes we see most distinctly,
<br/>according to Schlegel, the Fates weaving their dark web
<br/>on the bosom of Time. Seneca somewhere says that a
<br/>man might almost look upon death with indifference,
<br/>on account of the monotony of human affairs—from see-
<br/>ing and hearing and experiencing, day after day, month
<br/>after month, year after year, the same dull, unvarying
<br/>round. “We see the same sights that our fathers have
<br/>seen,” &amp;c. And when we finally come to adduce the very-
<br/>highest authority for the assertion that “there is nothing
<br/>new under the sun,” (“under the sun” being in this case
<br/>by no means contractiles or words of limitation, but of de-
<br/>finiteness and force, and applicable equally to the moon,)
<br/>We shall have so impregnably fortified our generic posi-
<br/>tion, that if we happen to encounter cavils when predi-
<br/>cating the same of specifics, we may retire and syllogis-
<br/>tically bid them defiance thus: “all things are used up:</p>
         <p> literary topics (if you please) are things: ergo," icc.—
The conclusion is irresistible.
</p>
         <p>Well, literary topics are in a used up state. We have
<br/>books and papers upon every imaginable theme; from the
<br/>eternal universe, down through Smollett’s “Atom,” to
<br/>Leibnitz “Monad”; from high Olympus down to saw-
<br/>dust as an edible, including Wordsworth’s beggars, luna-
<br/>tics, old carts and flowers; from Ossian’s roaring Ocean
<br/>down to Park fountains with their presiding deities, to
<br/>poor Wordsworth’s “tear of Gratitude”; from the gene-
<br/>rations of the Gods of old, down to (illustrious instance
<br/>of the efficacy of Bathos!) Hamadryads and carious teeth
<br/>set in rhyme by a Mr. (suppose we venture to vote this
<br/>last named compound subject decidedly 'done brown’, to-
<br/>gether with bran-bread and perpetual motion, and pro-
<br/>pose their being conjointly set aside, as a sort of tripod-
<br/>Pharos, to warn the tempest-tossed on the “raging canal”
<br/>of literature, against attempting analogous subjects?)
<br/>from father Saturn through father Æneas directly descen-
<br/>ding, and the ‘ oldest inhabitant’, down to the great grand-
<br/>children of ‘millions yet unborn’.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And the writers too, upon all these worn out objects—
<br/>what a mongrel congregation! Combining those of the
<br/>most dissonant ranks, the list extends from Solomon down
<br/>through Ikon basilike James, “Solomon the second”, to
<br/>our contemporary Lowell factory-girls and learned black-
<br/>smith; the said blacksmith uniting the very classically
<br/>compatible attributes of a peripatetic Doctor of some thir-
<br/>ty or forty different languages, and a manufacturer of
<br/>shovels, hoes, and such like ferruginous curiosities, and
<br/>most likely solving problems that staggered old Scotus
<br/>and Aquinas, as his patron Saint struck out Minerva from
<br/>Jupiter’s cranium—with his sledge-hammer (or axe, as oc-
<br/>casion demands). However, let the authors pass for the
<br/>present.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are no heroes, or remarkable specimens of huma-
<br/>nity, of ancient or modern times, whose names and qual-
<br/>ties have not been used to form the nuclei of prolix his-
<br/>tories, or eke out ten thousand verses. Æschylus treated
<br/>Orestes (not Brownson) handsomely; Sophocles varied
<br/>and decidedly failed to improve him; rag-loving Euripi-
<br/>des used him up. The Eumenides were hammered out
<br/>at the same time, to save future trouble. Old Mr. Prynne
<br/>used up dramatic heroes and the Drama, what time his
<br/>ears yet rejoiced in their physical integrity. Lord Cla-
<br/>rendon, Ormond, and some others, weakened that “cer-
<br/>tain mechanic fellow by name Oliver Goldsmith,” his
<br/>fair reputation; and it seems to be in a fair way of being
<br/>used up in Westminster, by a kind of “Statuary Oblivion.
<br/>Du Bose beat away “the good Duke” and Prince Eugene,
<br/>to a certain extent, and Southey afterwards lent his par-
<br/>tial aid, (simultaneously informing us of the innocence
<br/>of young children, and the fact of sculls having been ex-
<br/>humed on a battle-field) in some lines on Peterkin—or
<br/>something else. Cicero most effectually hammered out
<br/>Catiline, in a series of orations of the most of which he
<br/>never was delivered: and no doubt Sallust thought him-
<br/>self to be damning said Catiline to all posterity, when
<br/>communicating the interesting fact of his pace having
<br/>been sometimes rapid, and at other times tardy. Julius
<br/>Cæsar of Rome began first to beat himself out in his ly-
<br/>ing Commentaries—in the which work he has been ever
<br/>since indefatigably assisted; and Sir Julius Caesar, Knt.,
<br/>Judge, &amp;c., of England, has been hammered out quite
<br/>successfully by his grand-son, a Mr. Lodge, and divers
<br/>other philanthropists.</p>
         <p>Sir Julius Cæsar—Heavens! what a name,
To fill the speaking trump of future Fame!

         <p>Pilgrims in general have been used up by Bulwer, Bun-
<br/>yan, &amp;c.; the former choosing for the scene of action a
<br/>Dutch river, and the latter the road to Heaven. St. Am-
<br/>brosius used up Virgins in a formidable, tri-volumed trea-
<br/>tise; and thence down to the present time, they have con-
<br/>tinued to be a pretty favorite topic. Scott the Quaker
<br/>hammered out military effects in the abstract, together
<br/>with an old drum, in an ode instinct with real Vatinian
<br/>affection for them. Cervantes, Hudibras Butler and “Dr.
<br/>Great Unknown” used up Knights-errant, Chivalry and
<br/>scandalized Puritanism, definitively. Bloomfield the shoe-
<br/>maker used the leather to which he was stipulated to be
<br/>confined, in much the same manner as that in which Dido
<br/>and her equally injurious subjects used their bull’s-hide;
<br/>and not adhering to it condensedly, but cutting it out in-
<br/>to long, thin strips, and so circumscribing a vasty region,
<br/>he made desultory percursions at his leisure, and sung he-
<br/>roes of Farmer-boys, and collateral subjects. And, by the
<br/>way, (and diverging from our line of heroes, whose com-
<br/>plete enumeration would be endless,) this same illustri-
<br/>ous Bloomfield, with Theocritus, Thomson, Virgil, Pope,
<br/>(the vigorous personifier of his father Thames’ head,)
<br/>and a few other worthies, have entirely written up the
<br/>country and its appurtenances. Trees and leaves and
<br/>meadows and groves and mountains, and so forth, are be-
<br/>come as common as mud. Fatal to try them. As to ci-
<br/>ties, they are in much the same predicament. E. g. Ho-
<br/>mer hammered out Troy tolerably well, and Virgil gal-
<br/>vanized and re-hammered it out secondarily and forever;
<br/>so that Irish Phillips’ very pathetic interrogatory, in one
<br/>of his universal speeches, as to its present state, might
<br/>be readily and categorically answered. The multiplica-
<br/>tion of instances of this kind would be superfluous. The
<br/>weather has been used up, from its ante-diluvian condi-
<br/>tion, down through its effects upon London as specifically
<br/>pointed out in Gay’s Trivia, to its future prospects as all set
<br/>forth in embryo magazine sonnets, yet patiently awaiting
<br/>next Summer’s advent, like spring-traps—or the Duke of
<br/>Wellington’s magnanimous Guards, lying in ambush for
<br/>French cavalry. The Passions—most specially and pre-
<br/>eminently that of Love—have been—but heigho! we will
<br/>for the present forbear touching on this subject. Itis big
<br/>with materials enough for another Bodleian Library.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In short, we have Essays and Treatises and Histories
<br/>and Poems and Novels and Non-descripts upon every
<br/>theme; and the seeker for a blast from Fame’s golden
<br/>clarion, at this late day, must be wofully puzzled, when
<br/>reflecting upon the means of making her a meet-offering.
<br/>When he comes, in a fit of despair, to decompose exist-
<br/>ing elements, and attempt their re-composition, he finds
<br/>with dismay that others have been previously engaged in
<br/>the same delightful avocation, for a long succession of
<br/>years; and that the business has been so prosperously
<br/>carried on (and so much more regard paid to the decom-
<br/>position than the recomposition) that if good mother Na-
<br/>ture should happen for one moment to assume the confor-
<br/>mation so generously apportioned to her in some of his
<br/>predecessors’ books, she would become in sooth a hetero-
<br/>geneous and inconsistent mass—to the eye a primal Cha-
<br/>os, and to the ear a Pandemonium. He will discover
<br/>that the functions proper of the Imagination have been
<br/>completely discharged, and might as well be blotted out
<br/>forever, like Uncle Toby’s oath. He will be apt to ask,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>‘ What profits it to possess an useless faculty’? And on
<br/>looking about, he will find likewise sterility in every oth-
<br/>er province.</p>
         <p>But let us “play, for fun,” that our unfortunate is de-
</p>
         <p>termined to write upon something, despite its communi-
<br/>ty of treatment; that having devoted long-long years to
<br/>intellectual cultivation, he is urged both by literary pride
<br/>and a despair of success in other walks of life, with
<br/>which he is comparatively unacquainted, to attempt this.
<br/>Very well. He selects a subject, after an infinite deal of
<br/>trouble, and begins it, only to learn that he cannot even
<br/>at the outset treat of it in a manner new and before un-
<br/>used. Let him, for instance, if he be a Poet, undertake
<br/>an Epic. Of course, firstly he wants a worthy Exordium:
<br/>and here he meets a key-note with variations that have
<br/>themselves become monotonous. There are those of “the
<br/>blind old man”—of the Mantuan—of Tasso—of Milton
<br/>(perhaps “the blind young man”, by way of contra-dis-
<br/>tinction—and whose blindness Johnson thought would
<br/>have been more pitiable if his eyes had been better em-
<br/>ployed than in the Parliamentary service)—of one old
<br/>Joel Barlow, (tragic name!) and in fine, of an host—
<br/>from all which he can surely choose some one as capital-
<br/>ly apposite for his effusions, as Sallust’s Preface is for
<br/>Histories and things in general. Ten chances to one, he
<br/>founders at the beginning.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If the opium-eater suffered real misery, when in a vast
<br/>library he could not avoid thinking of the utter futility
<br/>of any endeavor to become acquainted with one half of
<br/>the volumes ranged around him, how must he have been
<br/>affected when pondering the possibility of acquiring dis-
<br/>tinction by a resort to authorship? He saw, frowning
<br/>upon him, the results of the labors of minds, if not migh-
<br/>tier, or more comprehensive, or more poetically attuned,
<br/>than his own, yet which had anticipated him. And he
<br/>speaks bitterly—complainingly—and as at another time
<br/>he probably would not have spoken. He might have
<br/>thought with Voltaire, that it is only in the earlier sta-
<br/>ges of society, when a large portion of mankind is buried
<br/>in ignorance, that great intellects appear very conspicu-
<br/>ous; as the gigantic oak, which, rearing its arduous
<br/>branches solitary on the plain, strikes the beholder with
<br/>admiration, would, if seen in an extensive forest, sur-
<br/>rounded with others (although not in all respects its
<br/>equals) scarcely attract a notice. Not that the intellect
<br/>now-a-days is by any means stinted or grown impotent—
<br/>but that it enjoys no solitude of greatness. Not that the
<br/>oak is in the least diminished,—but has become some-
<br/>what ordinary, by its relation to a multitude of others.—
<br/>He came into the world, and found it already full of mas-
<br/>ter minds and fluent tongues and rapid pens; and to cope
<br/>with these, he was obliged to resort to labors, which,
<br/>had they been undergone, with equal advantages, a couple
<br/>of centuries before, would have built up a name for him,
<br/>forever. He was unfortunate—but only so by the decree
<br/>of Fate.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And yet, after all due allowance made for the great
<br/>number of worthy competitors, he would have found left,
<br/>against which to strive, a certain class, which, although
<br/>as to worth, despicable, is not so as to numbers and its
<br/>means of getting under foot—that glorious, everlasting,
<br/>host of scribblers—that “mob of gentlemen who write
<br/>with ease”—(to themselves, no doubt), and with whom
<br/>we are blessed in great abundance, in this our age of uni-
<br/>versal erudition. No one would be hardy enough to
<br/>doubt the possession, by each and every of this highly re-
<br/>spectable phalanx, of some original idea: but every hon-
<br/>est citizen does (or should) doubt the propriety of a di-
<br/>lution of that idea in a Quarto of a thousand pages—of
<br/>the attenuation throughout mortal volumes of what might
<br/>be just as conveniently, and much more intelligibly, ex-
<br/>posed, in two or three brief sentences.</p>

         <p>If Tully spoke the truth, when saying of a voluminous
<br/>author of his time, that he could be easily burnt with
<br/>his writings, what magnificent funereal pyres would the
<br/>productions of some of these men make, and to what
<br/>perfect combustion reduce them! Still they insist upon
<br/>getting pregnant with their sickening imbecilities, and
<br/>even upon a premature delivery thereof. “The cry is
<br/>still they come”.—It is said that one old Abbe Du Ma-
<br/>rolle’s paroxysms on this head were so severe, that hav-
<br/>ing printed up all his manuscripts, he finally fell to print-
<br/>ing catalogues of his friends, &amp;c., at his own expense—
<br/>to which catastrophe he was forced by his inexorable
<br/>booksellers; and to which, if some of our aforesaid host
<br/>should be driven, they would perhaps go mad, and thus
<br/>really “do the State some service.” Books and papers
<br/>they seem to feel it their most stringent duty to print,
<br/>and books and papers they do print; helping zealously
<br/>to use things up, each according to his or her several
<br/>ability—(though possibly it is matter of rejoicing that one
<br/>province—that of Classical Literature—is in its nature
<br/>safe from pollution by their Harpy-like quills). And books
<br/>and papers are books and papers; and thousands of well-
<br/>meaning persons look at, and sometimes through them,
<br/>because, usurping the place of their betters, they are
<br/>thrust in their faces.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Kant and his followers, by a keen and discriminating
<br/>system of exclusion, fairly established an exotic school;
<br/>and if there be no extraordinary degree of merit in its
<br/>tenets, at least it cannot easily lead great numbers astray.
<br/>If something of this nature were resorted to, some splen-
<br/>did ideographic system, to–––––</p>
         <p>But we grow digressive. Therefore, as we began, so
let us end—“ Tero, terere, trivi, tritum.”
To Isadore.
</p>
         <p>Beneath the vine-clad eaves
<br/>Whose shadows fall before
<br/>Thy lowly cottage door—</p>
         <p>Under the lilac’s tremulous leaves—
Within thy snowy, clasped hand
The purple flowers st bore—
Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
Like queenly nymph from Fairy-Land—
–––––Enchantress of the Flowery Wand,
Most beautiful Isadore!
And when I bade the dream
Upon thy spirit flee,
</p>
         <p>Thy violet eyes to me
<br/>Upturned, did overflowing seem
<br/>With the deep, untold delight
<br/>Of Love’s serenity;</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Thy classic brow, like lilies white
<br/>And pale as the imperial Night
<br/>Upon her throne, with stars bedight,</p>
         <p>Enthrall’d my soul to thee!
Ah! ever I behold
Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
Blue as the languid skies
Hung with the sunset’s fringe of gold;
Now strangely clear thine image grows,
</p>
         <p>And olden memories
<br/>Are startled from their long repose
<br/>Like shadows on the silent snows
<br/>When suddenly the night-wind blows
<br/>Where quiet moonlight lies.</p>
         <p>Like music heard in dreams,
Like strains of harps unknown,
Of birds forever flown—
Audible as the voice of streams
That murmur in some leafy dell,
I hear thy gentlest tone,
</p>
         <p>And silence cometh with her spell
<br/>Like that which on my tongue doth dwell
<br/>When tremulous in dreams I tell
<br/>My love to thee alone!</p>
         <p>In every valley heard,
Floating from tree to tree,
Less beautiful to me,
The music of the radiant bird,
Than artless accents such as thine
Whose echoes never flee!
Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:—
</p>
         <p>For uttered in thy tones benign
<br/>(Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
<br/>Doth seem a melody!</p>
         <p>The Power of Words.
Otnos.—Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-
fledged with immortality!
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for
<br/>which pardon is to be demanded. Not even here is
<br/>knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom ask of the
<br/>angels freely, that it may be given!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Oinos.—But in this existence, I dreamed that I should
<br/>be at once cognizant of all things, and thus at once happy
<br/>in being cognizant of all.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Agathos.—Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in
<br/>the acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we
<br/>are for ever blessed; but to know all were the curse of &amp;
<br/>fiend.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—But does not The Most High know all?
Agathos.—That (since he is The Most Happy) must be
still the one thing unknown even to Him.	
Oinos.—But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must
not at last all things be known?
Agathos.—Look down into the abysmal distances!––
attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas
of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them thus––and
</p>
         <p>thus—and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
<br/>points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the uni-
<br/>verse?—the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies
<br/>that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?</p>
         <p>Oinos.—I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is
no dream.
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—There are no dreams in Aidenn—but it is
<br/>here whispered that, of this [infinity of matter, the sole
<br/>purpose is to afford infinite springs, at which the soul
<br/>may allay the thirst to know which is for ever unquench-
<br/>able within it—since to quench it would be to extinguish
<br/>the soul’s self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and
<br/>without fear. Come! we will leave to the left the loud
<br/>harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the
<br/>throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for
<br/>pansies and violets, and heart’s-ease, are the beds of the
<br/>triplicate and triple-tinted suns.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Oinos.—And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!
<br/>speak to me in the earth’s familiar tones! I understood
<br/>not what you hinted to me, just now, of the modes or of
<br/>the methods of what, during mortality, we were accus-
<br/>tomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the
<br/>Creator is not God?</p>
         <p>Agathos.—I mean to say that the Deity does not create,
Oinos.—Explain!
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page244"/>
         </p>
         <p>Agathos.—In the beginning only, he created. The 
<br/>seeming creatures which are now, throughout the uni-
<br/>verse, so perpetually springing into being, can only be 
<br/>considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or 
<br/>immediate results of the Divine creative power.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be
considered heretical in the extreme.
Agathos.—Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be
simply true.
</p>
         <p>Oinos.—I can comprehend you thus far—that certain
<br/>operations of what we term Nature, or the natural laws,
<br/>will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has
<br/>all the appearance of creation. Shortly before the final
<br/>overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember,
<br/>many very successful experiments in what some philoso-
<br/>phers were weak enough to denominate the creation of
<br/>animalculæ.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Agathos.—The cases of which you speak were, in fact,
<br/>instances of the secondary creation—and of the only spe-
<br/>cies of creation which has ever been, since the first word
<br/>spoke into existence the first law.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Oinos.—Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss
<br/>of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not
<br/>these stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the 
<br/>King?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Agathos.—Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you,
<br/>step by step, to the conception I intend. You are well
<br/>aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is with-
<br/>out infinite result. We moved our hands, for example,
<br/>when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing,
<br/>we gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.
<br/>This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave im-
<br/>pulse to every particle of the earth’s air, which thence- 
<br/>forward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement 
<br/>of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe
<br/>well knew. They made the special effects, indeed,
<br/>wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of
<br/>exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine in
<br/>what precise period an impulse of given extent would en-
<br/>girdle the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the
<br/>atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no
<br/>difficulty, from a given effect, under given conditions, in
<br/>determining the value of the original impulse. Now the
<br/>mathematicians who saw that the results of any given
<br/>impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw that a
<br/>portion of these results were accurately traceable through
<br/>the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the faci-
<br/>lity of the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same
<br/>time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself
<br/>a capacity for indefinite progress—that there were no
<br/>bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability,
<br/>except within the intellect of him who advanced or ap-
<br/>plied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—And why, Agathos, should they have pro-
ceeded?
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—Because there were some considerations of
<br/>deep interest, beyond. It was deducible from what they
<br/>knew, that to a being of infinite understanding—one to
<br/>whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfold-
<br/>ed—there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
<br/>given the air—and the ether through the air—to the re-
<br/>motest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch
<br/>of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such im-
<br/>pulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every indi-
<br/>vidual thing that exists within the universe;—and the
<br/>being of infinite understanding—the being whom we have
<br/>imagined—might trace the remote undulations of the im-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>pulse—trace them upward and onward in their influences
<br/>upon all particles of all matter—upward and onward for
<br/>ever in their modifications of old forms—or in in other
<br/>words, in their creation of new—until he found them re-
<br/>flected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of
<br/>the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,
<br/>but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him
<br/>—should one of these numberless comets, for example, be
<br/>presented to his inspection,—he could have no difficulty
<br/>in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what
<br/>original impulse it was due. This power of retrograda-
<br/>tion in its absolute fulness and perfection—this faculty of
<br/>referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is of
<br/>course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every
<br/>variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the
<br/>power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic
<br/>Intelligences.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—In speaking of the air, I referred only to the
<br/>earth:—but the general proposition has reference to im-
<br/>pulses upon the ether—which, since it pervades, and
<br/>alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
<br/>creation.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates.
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—It must: but a true philosophy has long
<br/>taught that the source of all motion is thought—and the
<br/>source of all thought is—</p>
         <p>Oinos.—God.
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of
<br/>the fair Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon
<br/>the atmosphere of the Earth.</p>
         <p>Oinos.—You did.
</p>
         <p>Agathos.—And while I thus spoke, did there not cross
<br/>your mind some thought of the physical power of words?
<br/>Is not every word an impulse on the air ?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Oinos.—But why, Agathos, do you weep?—and why—
<br/>oh why do your wings droop as we hover above this lair
<br/>star—which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all
<br/>we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant flowers
<br/>look like a fairy dream—but its fierce volcanoes like the
<br/>passions of a turbulent heart.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Agathos.—They are!—they are! This wild star—it
<br/>is now three centuries since with clasped hands, and with
<br/>streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved—I spoke it—
<br/>with a few passionate sentences—into birth. Its bril-
<br/>liant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and
<br/>its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbu-
<br/>lent and unhallowed of hearts.	EDGAR A. POE</p>
         <p>Lines.
In early years, when quite a boy,
I had a dream of sweet import,
’Twas full of deep and tranquil joy—
A fancy only—scarce a thought.
I know not how it form’d or grew,
And yet 'twas with me day and night;
With sunny hair and eyes ot blue,
A thing of shadow and of light!
So dim—uncertain—yet so fair —
No thing of substance, nor of air!
Those eyes of blue, that golden hair,
Haunted my young heart everywhere.
Youth came—and childhood’s dreams were o’er;
Experience told me they were vain;
Yet still the dream I dream’d of yore,
Returned and haunted me again.
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page243"/>
My mind was full of wild romance,
Which reason scarcely could control,
And this sweet dream served to enhance
The unquiet yearnings of my soul.
I asked my heart what it could be,
</p>
         <p>This sweet and moat strange mystery?
<br/>Which, like some old loved melody
<br/>Heard in oar youth, returns to me?</p>
         <p>My youth has flown, as birds take wing,
Romance to truth has yielded place;
Yet ever and anon will spring
The memory of that angel face.
In the belief can there be truth?
That two are formed to meet and love;
That dreami which haunt us in our youth
In after years will real prove!
If true I shall not always pine,
Anxiously waiting the appointed sign;—
If true! oh yet it may be mine,
To clasp in mortal form this dream divine! W.
Incidents of College Life.
</p>
         <p>The entrance of a new member to a class in College,
<br/>is a fruitful source of speculation and conjecture. Every-
<br/>body must know where he is from, who are his friends,
<br/>into what circle of society he will be likely to fall, and
<br/>every thing about his habits and character which can be
<br/>gathered from those who ever heard of him, or his rela-
<br/>tives.</p>
         <p>It was one day in the spring term of our sophomore
year, that report said a man from A–––––––, S. C., had been
</p>
         <p>admitted to our class, and the usual curiosity to see him
<br/>was manifested. His first appearance among us was at
<br/>prayers in the chapel. It was such as to prepossess one
<br/>in his favor, and bespoke him a cordial welcome; and
<br/>those who pretended to most discernment in such mat-
<br/>ters, and take it upon them to utter public opinion as if
<br/>it had its origin with them, whispered many brilliant
<br/>things about the new comer, and spoke of him in terms
<br/>almost of admiration. There were others, however, who,
<br/>though they took no particular interest in an early ac-
<br/>quaintance with their new classmate, thought they saw
<br/>a covertness and insincerity in his countenance, but they
<br/>were by no means confident enough of the correctness of
<br/>their opinion to express it, but were willing that his char-
<br/>acter should in due time appear in his actions.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Time passed, and Bertram was no longer a stranger,
<br/>but became one of us, and the circumstance of his having
<br/>but lately entered the class was forgotten. Indeed, he
<br/>was becoming exceedingly popular; for he proved to be
<br/>a man of engaging manners, liberal principles, artful in
<br/>his schemes, and possessing withal considerable acquain-
<br/>tance with human nature. He seemed to possess a kind
<br/>of second sight, by which he never failed to predict the
<br/>popular side of every question, and was sure to be among
<br/>its earliest advocates.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For reasons not necessary here to state, our Professor in
<br/>Latin became somewhat unpopular with a part of the
<br/>class; and one of the ways in which this manifes-
<br/>ted itself was, that the moment the hour specifi-
<br/>ed for the recitation by the College laws had expired,
<br/>according to the time kept by the students themselves,
<br/>there was an unaccountable movement of feet, which in-
<br/>creased to such a degree, as to render very unpleasant
<br/>any further procedure with the lesson, if a little of it
<br/>chanced not to have been recited. This was continued,
<br/>to the great annoyance of many of the class, who felt</p>
         <p/>
         <p>more anxiety to acquire a knowledge of Latin than to
<br/>vex the Professor, and show that little spite which those
<br/>indulging it would not dare gratify in an open, and manly
<br/>way.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As might be supposed, Burtram was bitter toward the
<br/>offending officer; no one more proudly set his autho-
<br/>rity at defiance, or applied to him more abusive epithets,
<br/>though it was whispered that no one seemed more open-
<br/>hearted and friendly in his presence, or acted the hypo-
<br/>crite with more perfect success.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Burtram’s boots were singularly quiet when he was so
<br/>situated that the Professor could have the slightest suspi-
<br/>cion of him, if they clamored at all; but if he was well
<br/>concealed, they hammered the floor with an energy wor-
<br/>thy a better cause.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>My friend, Cheever, usually sat directly behind Bur-
<br/>tram, and was not more disturbed by his noise than dis-
<br/>gusted by his duplicity; and he at last declared to me, if
<br/>he was called to recite, and was thus interrupted, he
<br/>would expose the first man he saw out of order. He well
<br/>knew that he would thus bring upon himself the unmiti-
<br/>gated abuse of the disaffected part of the class; but he
<br/>denied their right to deprive him of the advantages of re-
<br/>citation, just because he happened to stand a few mo-
<br/>ments beyond the allotted hour, shortened, as it frequent-
<br/>ly was, by their impatience.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cheever was a quiet and unassuming man, a real en-
<br/>thusiast in his studies, and excelled in every department,
<br/>but was never supposed to be capable of acting with
<br/>much decision in resenting an injury.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was at the very next recitation that he was called
<br/>to read the last passage in the lesson, and before he had
<br/>completed it, the usual confusion commenced. Cheever
<br/>endured it for a moment, raising his voice as the noise
<br/>increased; but suddenly fixing his eyes upon his next
<br/>neighbor, who was laboring away with his usual zeal
<br/>he exclaimed, “Burtram, stop that noise, or I’ll report
<br/>you!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In an instant there was a perfect silence. All were as-
<br/>tonished at the suddenness of so singular an exclamation,
<br/>coming, as it did, from such an unexpected source.—
<br/>Meanwhile Cheever proceeded to complete his recitation
<br/>at his leisure; and what was better still, no one was
<br/>troubled any further in the same way.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As was anticipated, Burtram declared the measure of
<br/>Cheever a base insult to the class, and to himself in par-
<br/>ticular, and vowed consummate revenge.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We now pass over the history of more than a year—
<br/>during which time all things moved on as usual, and the
<br/>occurrence above mentioned had been forgotten as such
<br/>things are in College, being made the subject of re-
<br/>mark only a few days, and then are succeeded by some
<br/>other excitement, perhaps of a different nature.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Burtram found no way in which he could come in col-
<br/>lision with Cheever, who maintained his quiet, studious
<br/>habits, and was daily gaining friends, as he gradually
<br/>mingled more in society,—though as affairs were evi-
<br/>dently turning, there was no prospect of his coming into
<br/>favor with Burtram, for he was now looked upon by him
<br/>in the light of a rival,—and to see a man of Cheever’s
<br/>character and habits rise above him, was more than he
<br/>could submit to.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There had been for some time much noise at unseason-
<br/>able hours in a room directly over Cheever’s, greatly to
<br/>his disturbance, as well as all others in the vicinity. He
<br/>endured it till his patience was gone, for he was the prin-
<br/>cipal sufferer, and finally went to the disturbers of his</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page246"/>
         </p>
         <p>peace, among whom he found Burtram, and asked them
<br/>to refrain from thus interrupting his studies, saying at
<br/>the same time, he was sorry to be obliged to make any
<br/>such request, but he felt it due to himself and his inte-
<br/>rests as a scholar. No attention whatever was paid to
<br/>this request, gentlemanly and kind as it was, but the of-
<br/>fence, which was a direct violation of the laws of college,
<br/>continued as frequent as ever.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Cheever once more took occasion, after having lost
<br/>some hours of study, one night to go and say to the offen-
<br/>ders, that as a last resort, he would certainly report them
<br/>to the college authorities, if there was another occasion
<br/>of the kind; for he would not pay his money and spend
<br/>his time, to be wasted by others’ amusements, to an ex-
<br/>tent so unreasonable, and he thus stated plainly his inten-
<br/>tion, that it might not be said he did it in secret, if he
<br/>was so unhappy as to be obliged to do it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was not long after, when, one dark, stormy night,
<br/>after all had been still for some time, there commenced
<br/>the usual noise, loud talking, singing, boisterous laughing,
<br/>and all the accompaniments of a ‘ college row.’ Cheever
<br/>felt sufficiently provoked for the fulfilment of his pro-
<br/>mise, and he was ready for it. Throwing his cloak
<br/>about him he quietly left the building, and made his way
<br/>in the dark to the study of an officer of College, and just</p>
         <p>said to him his presence was needed at No.—,––––Hall;
</p>
         <p>and returned so soon that his absence was not discover-
<br/>ed. It was effectual to the breaking up of the party, but
<br/>no persons were discovered in the room but the occu-
<br/>pants, when the officer arrived, for they suddenly disper-
<br/>sed as soon as his footsteps were heard in the Hall.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The next morning Cheever was sent for by Prof. H., to
<br/>come to his study. He was well aware of the errand,
<br/>and determined to make it an object, first to find out
<br/>what the Professor actually knew about the matter, be-
<br/>fore he was asked any questions.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He discovered that the names of the offenders were
<br/>mostly known, and to his utter astonishment, found that
<br/>Bertram was the voluntary informer, which fact was evi-
<br/>dent from a remark accidentally dropped by the Professor.
<br/>It was enough! Cheever told the Professor that he was
<br/>in possession of more information than he could have
<br/>communicated, and was allowed to retire.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He saw that since it had been his avowed determina-
<br/>tion to report the offenders and that openly, Bertram, to
<br/>screen himself and gratify a long sought revenge, had
<br/>reported the whole story concerning his associates, feel-
<br/>ing confident his name would never be given as the au-
<br/>thor of the information, and that it would be perfectly
<br/>easy to charge it off upon Cheever, and brand his charac-
<br/>ter with a mean and cowardly act. He now had the key
<br/>to the whole affair, and determined, since he had gone
<br/>thus far, to keep the secret till he was obliged to disclose
<br/>it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was soon known among us that the connection of
<br/>these individuals with the College, must temporarily
<br/>cease, and it created not a little excitement. They were
<br/>persons who had many friends, and it was strongly con-
<br/>tended that they done nothing worthy of such severity,
<br/>and that it was the result of false information given to
<br/>the Faculty. Among their defenders Bertram was fore-
<br/>most, and he with others, diligently circulated the name
<br/>of Cheever as the author of all the mischief, proving it
<br/>by every circumstance that could favor the suspicion.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was with a high degree of satisfaction that he with
<br/>his friends proved out the comparative innocence of the
<br/>suspended ones, and showed the guilt of so representing
<br/>their (light offence as to bring upon them such a sen-</p>
         <p/>
         <p>tence, always concluding with charging it all to Chee-
<br/>ver’s account, until it came to be generally believed he
<br/>was guilty of a great wrong. There is no moderation in
<br/>College excitements, they run like a wild tempest, though
<br/>they are generally soon over. Cheever’s friends were at
<br/>a loss what to say, and thought his case a hard one. So
<br/>strong was the sympathy for the ‘suspended,’ that a
<br/>class meeting was called, to draw up a petition to the
<br/>Faculty in their behalf.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Prompt to the hour, the class were present, almost to a
<br/>man, though a few dropped in afterwards, and Cheever
<br/>among them. I feared for him when I saw him enter,
<br/>for most looked upon him with bitter accusations; but
<br/>he was calm and undisturbed as if nothing had happened.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Burtram, always forward in such matters, spoke first.
<br/>He stated the case of his suspended friends with great
<br/>feeling, showed in strong light the palliating circum-
<br/>stances to be set forth in the petition, and closed by say-
<br/>ing, “The elements of mischief are yet among us; there
<br/>are those of our own number—we hope they are few, and
<br/>expect them to be fewer—who, for the paltry considera-
<br/>tion of a factitious esteem with the Faculty, have not
<br/>only reported the innocent amusements of a few friends,
<br/>but have so done it, as to convey a false and exaggerated
<br/>notion of the extent to which the laws have been viola-
<br/>ted, and have thus procured this unjust sentence! I say</p>
         <p>we have those–––I correct myself—we have one among
</p>
         <p>us of this character, and I appeal to gentlemen of the
<br/>class to say in what light such an one should be regard-
<br/>ed”?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The common opinion of one class of the students, made
<br/>up from the reports in circulation, and the unblushing
<br/>assurance with which these charges were made, were
<br/>enough to fasten suspicion, and fix all eyes upon Cheever.
<br/>This he perceived, and rose to reply, amid the half sup-
<br/>pressed hisses of his enemies, yet with a cool, undis-
<br/>turbed air, as one who was fully assured of the justice of
<br/>his cause. He stated the history of the whole matter
<br/>from the beginning in a plain and simple way, and add-
<br/>ed, “If to persist in claiming my right to my time un-
<br/>disturbed, as guarantied by the College laws—if to in-
<br/>form the authorities concerned of the violation of those
<br/>rights after using every other method in my power to
<br/>prevent their infraction is wrong, I am guilty ; for though
<br/>I made no such report, (because it was made by another)
<br/>I fully intended to do it.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>At this point Burtram evinced great perturbation, so
<br/>much as to excite the surprise of all, and particularly of
<br/>his friends; and he turned deadly pale as Cheever, cast-
<br/>ing a withering glance upon him, exclaimed, “You ‘blue
<br/>skin’! I charge upon you the meanness of being the un-
<br/>provoked, voluntary reporter of the faults of your own
<br/>friends—faults, too, in which you can truly say, ‘ pars
<br/>magna fui”—and this you did to screen yourself, that you
<br/>might escape * unwhipped of justice.’ I charge upon you
<br/>the attempt, so far apparently successful to implicate me
<br/>in the guilt that defiles your own character, thinking you
<br/>was safe from detection. All this I charge upon you.—
<br/>I do it publicly, and fearlessly; and deny it if you can"!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A thunder-clap in a clear sky could not have been more
<br/>astounding than this information. We looked at each
<br/>other, and then at Burtram, to see if he was not about to
<br/>reply, but his mouth was shut. The truth had met him
<br/>at a terrible moment, and his humiliation was complete,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The meeting adjourned, but Burtram could never after-
<br/>ward look a man of us in the face; and in a few days his
<br/>place was vacant, and he was no wore numbered among
<br/>us.	L. S. Y.</p>

The Songs of our Land and Other Poems. By Mary L.
Hewitt. Boston. William D. Ticknor &amp; Co.
</p>
         <p>In point of external taste, this is the most exquisite vol-
<br/>ume of poems published in America since “The Spanish
<br/>Student,” of Longfellow. The unusual width of the page
<br/>is especially to our fancy, and the general arrangement
<br/>of the matter could not be improved. The small pica
<br/>type, however, is perhaps a trifle too large for the size of
<br/>the page.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The volume contains fifty pieces, of course varied in
<br/>excellence, but all speaking, in unmistakeable terms, of
<br/>the author’s poetic fervor, classicism of taste, and keen
<br/>appreciation of the morally as well as physically beauti-
<br/>ful. No one can read the book without a desire to be-
<br/>come acquainted with the woman.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mrs. Hewitt has evidently a strong partiality for the
<br/>sea—and this partiality has given color to some of the
<br/>most forcible, although, in our opinion, by no means the
<br/>most generally meritorious compositions in the volume.
<br/>“The Yarn,” we believe, is a favorite with its author,
<br/>and is certainly replete with vigorous thought and expres-
<br/>sion. “God Bless The Mariner,” we quote as the best
<br/>of this species of poem to he found in the collection.</p>
         <p>God’s blessing on the Mariner!
A venturous life leads he—
What reck the landsmen of their toil,
Who dwell upon the sea?
The landsman sits within his home,
His fireside bright and warm;
Nor asks how fares the mariner
All night amid the storm.
God bless the hardy Mariner!
A homely garb wears he,
And he goeth with a rolling gait,
Like a ship upon the sea.
He hath piped the loud “ay! ay sir!"
O’er the voices of the main,
Till his deep tones have the hoarseness
Of the rising hurricane.
His seamed and honest visage
The sun and wind have tanned,
And hard as iron gauntlet
Is his broad and sinewy hand.
But oh! a spirit looketh
Lrom out his clear, blue eye,
With a truthful, childlike earnestness,
Like an angel from the sky.
A venturous life the sailor leads
Between the sky and sea—
But when the hour of dread is past,
A merrier who, than he?
</p>
         <p>He knows that by the rudder bands
<br/>Stands one well skilled to save;
<br/>For a strong hand is the Steersman’s
<br/>That directs him o’er the wave.</p>
         <p/>
         <p> “Alone” evinces, we think, more of the true poetic in-
<br/>apiration—and undoubtedly more of originality in concep-
<br/>tion than any other of Mrs. Hewitt’s poems. We copy it
<br/>in full:</p>
         <p>There lies a deep and seated well
Within yon leafy forest hid;
Whose pent and lonely waters swell,
Its confines chill and drear amid.
It hears the birds on every spray
Trill forth melodious notes of love—
It feels the warm sun’s seldom ray
Glance on the stone its wave above—
And quick the gladdened waters rush
Tumultuous upward to the brink;
A seal is on their joyous gush,
And back, repressed, they coldly shrink.
Thus in their caverned space, apart.
Closed from the eye of day, they dwell—
So, prisoned deep within my heart,
The tides of quick affection swell.
Each kindly glance—each kindly tone,
To joy its swift pulsations sway;
But none may lifl the veiling stone,
And give the franchised current way.
Smite thou the rock, whose eye alone,
The hidden spring within may see;
And bid the flood, resistless one!
Flow forth, rejoicing, unto thee.
</p>
         <p>The pieces, however, which will prove most decidedly
<br/>popular with men of taste, and which, upon the whole,
<br/>convey the most pleasing impression of the author’s abil-
<br/>ity, are the three sonnets entitled Cameos.. We make
<br/>no apology for quoting them:</p>
         <p>I.
With springing hoof that would the earth disdain,
Broad, swelling chest, and limb with motion rife,
From Lapithæan banquet and the strife,
Fleetly he bounds along Thessalia’s plain.
And on his back, in rude embrace entwined.
A captive bride he bears. Her trait’rous veil
Reveals her brow, as Juno’s roses pale,
And floats like scarf of Iris on the wind.
And vainly struggling ’gainst that bold caress,
Her outstretched arms essay the air to grasp;
But firm the captor holds his iron clasp,
And strives, with ruthless lip, her lip to press.
Thus vice hath power to sway the feeble soul,
And bear it on in measureless control.
II.
Reclined enervate on the couch of ease,
No more he pants for deeds of high emprise;
For pleasure holds in soft, voluptuous ties
Enthrall’d, great Jove-descended Hercules.
The hand that bound the Erymanthian boar,
Hesperia’s dragon slew, with bold intent—
That from his quivering side in triumph rent
The skin the Cleenæan lion wore,
</p>
         <p>Holds forth the goblet—while the Lydian queen
<br/>Robed like a nymph, her brow enwreathed with Vine-
<br/>Lifts high the amphora, brimmed with rosy wine,</p>
         <p>And pours the draught the crownéd cup within.
And thus the soul, abased to sensual sway,
Its worth forsakes—its might foregoes for aye.
III.
Oh! wondrous marvel of the sculptor’s art!
What cunning hand hath culled thee from the mine,
And carved thee into life, with skill divine!
How claims in thee humanity a part—
Seems from the gem the form enchained, to start,
While thus with fiery eye, and outspread wings,
The ruthless vulture to his victim clings,
With whetted beak deep in the quivering heart.
Oh! thou embodied meaning, master wrought!
Thus taught the sage, how, sunk in crime and sin,
The soul a prey to conscience, writhes within
Its fleshly bonds enslaved:–thus ever, THOUGHT,
The breast’s keen torturer, remorseful tears
At life, the hell whose chain the soul in anguish wears.
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page248"/>
         </p>
         <p>Of these sonnets we much prefer the “Hercules and
<br/>Omphale.” It is full of a truly classic grace—both of
<br/>thought and expression, and would do honor to any poet
<br/>in the land. It has that common fault of American Son-
<br/>nets—the fault of a termination feeble in comparison with
<br/>the body of the poem—but even in this respect, it is su-
<br/>perior to most compositions of the kind. Its general ver-
<br/>sification is worthy of all praise; we have rarely, if ever,
<br/>seen it surpassed. Such lines as</p>
         <p>The skin the Cleoncan Lion wore,
have about them a directness which never fails to impart
strength.
Upon the whole, we are favorably impressed with the
book.
Morse's Cerographic Maps. No. 1. New-York. Har-
per &amp; Brothers, 82 Cliff-street.
</p>
         <p>We look upon this enterprise as one of the most impor-
<br/>tant, if not the most important, ever undertaken by an
<br/>American publisher. The plan of the publication is as
<br/>follows:</p>
         <p>1.  The size of the Maps will be about 15 inches by 12.
</p>
         <p>2.	The subjeets illustrated will embrace the whole field of An-
<br/>cient and Modern, including Sacred Geography, Chronology, and
<br/>History.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>3.	The work will be edited by Sidney E. Morse, A. M., and
<br/>when finished, it is intended, shall be a Universal Atlas in the
<br/>most comprehensive sense of the term.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>4.	Each number will contain four colored Maps, the price of
<br/>which will be twenty-five cents, being about one-fourth the cost of
<br/>copperplate Maps of a similar size.</p>
         <p/>

<br/>ly of countries in North America, and embracing separate Maps
<br/>of nearly every State in the Union.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>6.	The American Maps have been prepared with great care, and
<br/>to a great extent from new and original materials, collected dur-

         <p>This is one of the most truly beautiful volumes ever
<br/>issued even from the press of the Appletons. It is a duo-
<br/>decimo of neariy 600 pages, exquisitely printed on very
<br/>fine paper, embellished with a dozen carefully engraved
<br/>plates from Flaxman’s inimitable designs, and the whole
<br/>tastefully and durably bound. The title fully conveys
<br/>the contents of the book, with the exception of the front-
<br/>ispiece—which is a likeness of Dante, engraved by Philli-</p>

         <p>We make room, with much pleasure, for the following
explanation:
To the Editor of the Broadway Journal:
</p>
         <p>Sir—A copy of your Journal dated October 4th, was handed me
<br/>this evening, containing some observations respecting alterations
<br/>made in the song oi Ben Bolt, to which some music was adapted
<br/>by J. P. Webster. The facts were as follows. The song was in
<br/>a New-Haven paper, and came into my hands as an envelope. It
<br/>was without signature or reference of any kind, to the author. I
<br/>was pleased with the poetry, and gave it to Mr. Webster, as he said
<br/>he would compose some music for it. Before he had completed it,
<br/>he lost the copy, and asked if I could give him another from mem-
<br/>ory. The words published were written down by two or three per-
<br/>sons, as no one remembered the whole. As Mr. W. did not know
<br/>the author’s name, he could not of course give it. But from what
<br/>I know of him, I am certain that no thoughts of claiming the au-
<br/>thorship ever crossed his mind; and what may so appear in the
<br/>publication, is the result of carelessness.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Having been (though indirectly) the cause of the censure cast
<br/>upon Mr. Webster, I felt bound to make this statement, which I
<br/>doubt not you will have the justice to publish. I am ready to give
<br/>satisfactory reference, if you require it.</p>
         <p>_ 			Respectfully yours, E. S.
Derby, Conn., October 11, 1845.

PUBLISH THIS DAY,
Elements of Morality and Polity. 
BY PROF. WHEWELL.
</p>
         <p>THIS valuable new production, from the pen of
<br/> one of the most eminent scholars of the age,
<br/>exhibits, in a most lucid, exact, and elegant style,
<br/>the great principles of moral, political, and ecclesi-
<br/>astical science in a far more complete and methodi-
<br/>cal manner than has ever yet been presented to the
<br/> public. In offering this great work to the American
<br/>reader, the publisher begs leave to introduce it as
<br/>the commencement of a new and attractive series
<br/>of sterling books, to be issued by them, under the
<br/>general designation of</p>
         <p>HARPER’S NEW MISCELLANY;
the volumes of which will be legibly printed, in
duodecimo, on fine paper, and
Bound in extra Muslin Gilt—Price-
Fifty Cents a Volume,
</p>
         <p>and issued at short intervals. To render accessible
<br/>to the million, the fullest advantages of popular in-
<br/>struction in the various divisions of human know*</p>
         <p/>
         <p> ledge, is the design of the above series. It is appa-
<br/>rent in the present day, that books of intrinsic value
<br/>are demanded by the people. Formerly the popu-
<br/>lar taste preferred mainly works of mere amusement
<br/>—the great body of readers now seek them as vehi-
<br/>cles of general knowledge-books of a mote per-
<br/>manently valuable caste—devoted to some of the
<br/>departments of science, or general literature. A
<br/>new race has sprung up, glowing with the first
<br/>energies of youth, requiring more expanded ideas
<br/>of the world in which they live, and a more reliable
<br/>and well-digested knowledge of the men. and the
<br/>events of other times and countries. A class of
<br/>books expressly adapted to this demand, it is the
<br/>aim of the publishers to supply; and at a price so
<br/>exceedingly cheap that every person of ordinary
<br/>taste and advantages may thus become possessed
<br/>of a</p>
         <p>Complete Library of the Best Litera-
ture of the Age.
</p>
         <p>In this collection it is intended to include the best
<br/>productions in every department of knowledge;
<br/>popular philosophical treatises on topics of univer-
<br/>sal interest; the most compact and brilliant histori-
<br/>cal books; valuable biographical memoirs; modern
<br/>voyages and travels, Sic.; together with scientific
<br/>and other collateral divisions; in the selection of
<br/>all which, the most careful discrimination will be
<br/>observed A mere glance over the wide domain of
<br/>tour English literature will exhibit much yet unex-
<br/>plored and uncultivated, from which might be ga-
<br/> thered the fruits of a rich, luxuriant harvest; besides
<br/>which, the ever-teeming issues of the European
<br/>press open a vast revenue of literary wealth, from
<br/>which the above collection may be liberally suppli-
<br/>ed. Original productions from American writers
<br/>will also occasionally be introduced In submitting,
<br/>therefore, the esteemed work of Prof. Whewell
<br/>as a kind of first-fruits of their “New Miscellany,”
<br/>the publishers deem it only necessary to add, that
<br/>their arrangements for carrying forward the enter-
<br/> prise being of the most complete and efficient kind,
<br/>they confidently rely upon their efforts being met
<br/>with a ready response from the entire reading com-
<br/>munity.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This, they venture to believe, will be insured to
<br/>their Miscellany, no less from the intrinsic value
<br/>of the collection, than from its unparalleled econo
<br/>my; each volume being elegantly produced, sound</p>
         <p/>
         <p>IN HANDSOME AND SUBSTANTIAL STYLE, FITTED WITH-
<br/>OUT FARTHER EXPENSE FOR PERMANENT PRESERVA-
<br/>TION IN THE LIBRARY; the whole senes being issued
<br/>in uniform binding, while the price of each volume
<br/>will be only Fifty Cents—far below the cost of
<br/>ary similar series of books yet published in this,
<br/>or, it is believed, any other country.</p>

MANUFACTURER OF THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard
JF. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World that he has established himself for the manufacture
• and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at		
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchases the high duties
imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.	
</p>
         <p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principals, with all the modern improvements of 
<br/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
<br/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in	this	 country,	 in which	 respect they will be found far superior to any European manufac-</p>
         <p>ture, imported in the usual way.	
These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter he would mention
N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.	
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country
</p>
         <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:–Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of 
<br/>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stand proof
<br/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.  
<br/>January, 1845	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.</p>
         <p>Dear Sir :—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of Harps at Sig. Casella's Concert in this city.–	_
The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years.  
Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps,	indeed he himself used no other. Yours, most truly H. G. Trust. 
Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.	
 Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George's Society
Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps. 
The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN 
New York, January 16th, 1845. 
_____	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-	
</p>
         <p>ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
<br/>ease of modulation, they arc superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new 
<br/>Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will giveme great pleasure
<br/>in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.		Yous Truly, Henry Horn.</p>
