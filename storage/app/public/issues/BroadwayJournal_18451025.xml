         <p>Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some
            oriental investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsӧornot, a work which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides)
            is scarcely known at all, even in Europe, and which has
            never been quoted to my knowledge, by any American—
            if we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of
            American Literature;”—having had occasion, I say, to
            turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that
            the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error
            respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as that fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights,”
            and that the dénoument there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther.
         </p>
         
         <p>For full information on this interesting topic, I must
            refer the inquisitive reader to the “Isitsoornot" itself:
            but, in the mean time, I shall be pardoned for giving a
            summary of what I there discovered.
         </p>
         
         <p>It will be remembered that, in the usual version of
            the tales, a certain monarch, having good cause to be
            jealous of his queen, not only puts her to death, but makes
            a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to espouse each
            night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and
            the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter,
            and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feelings
            and excellent sense, he was interrupted one afternoon (no
            doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to
            Whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.
         </p>
         
         <p>Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that
            she would either redeem the land from the depopulating
            tax upon its beauty, or perish, after the approved fashion
            of all heroines, in the attempt.
         </p>
         
         <p>Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leapyear, (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious,) she
            deputes her father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to
            the king of her hand. This hand the king eagerly accepts—(he had intended to take it at all events, and had
            put off the matter from day to day, only through fear of
            the vizier)—but, in accepting it now, he gives all parties
            very distinctly to understand that, grand vizier or no
            grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of giving up
            one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,
            the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,
            and did actually marry him despite her father’s excellent
            advice not to do anything of the kind—when she would
            and did marry him, I say, will I nill I, it was with her
            beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of
            the case would allow.
         </p>
         
         <p>It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had
            been reading Machiavelli, beyond doubt,) had a very ingenious little plot in her mind. On the night of the wedding she contrived, upon I forget what specious pretenee,
            to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of
            the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to
            bed; and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to
            awaken the good monarch, her husband, (who bore her
            none the worse will because he intended to wring her
            neck on the morrow,)—she managed to awaken him, I
            say, (although, on account of a capital conscience and
            an easy digestion, he slept well,) by the profound interest
            of a story (about a rat and a black cat, I think,) which
            she was narrating (all in an under-tone, of course,) to her
            sister. When the day broke, it so happened that this
            history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in the nature of things, could not finish it just then,
            since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a thing a very little more pleasant than hanging,
            only a trifle more genteel.
         </p>
         
         <p>The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry
            to say, even over his sound religious principles, induced
            him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with the hope of
            hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black
            cat (a black cat I think it was) and the rat.
         </p>
         
         <p>The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat
            and the rat, (the rat was blue,) but before she well
            knew what she was about, found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not
            altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings)
            that went, in a violet manner, by clock-work, and was
            wound up with an indigo key. With this history the
            king was even more profoundly interested than with the
            other, and as the day broke before its conclusion, (notwithstanding all the queen’s endeavours to get through
            with it in time for the bowstringing,) there was again no
            resource but to postpone that ceremony as before, for
            twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a
            similar accident with a similar result; and then the
            next—and then again the next; so that, in the end, the
            good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all
            opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less
            than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or, (what is more probable) breaks it outright as well as the head of his father
            confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the
            whole seven baskets of talk which the latter lady, we
            all know, picked up from under the trees in the garden
            of Eden—Scheherazade, I say, finally triumphed, and the
            tariff upon beauty was repealed.
         </p>
         
         <p>Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we
            have it upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and
            pleasant—but, alas! like a great many pleasant things,
            is more pleasant than true; and I am indebted altogether
            to the “Isitsdӧornot” for the means of correcting the error. “Le mieux," says a French proverb, “est l'ennemi
            du bien," and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added
            that she put them out at compound interest until they
            amounted to seventy-seven.
         </p>
         
         <p>“My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand and second night, [I quote the language of the Isitsoornot, at
            this point, verbatim,] “my dear sister,” said she, “now
            that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has
            blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am
            sorry to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do)
            the full conclusion of the history of Sinbad the sailor.
            This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the
            truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a
            greivous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that
            Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to
            remedy my great neglect, and as soon as I have given
            the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far
            that he may stop making that horrible noise, I will
            forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases.) with the
            sequel of this very remarkable story.”
         </p>
         
         <p>Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from
            the “Isitsӧornot,” expressed no very particular intensity
            of gratification; but the king having been sufficiently
            pinched, at length ceased snoring, and finally said
            “hum!” and then “hoo!” when the queen understanding these words, (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify
            that he was all attention, and would do his best not to
            snore any more,—the queen, I say, having arranged these
            matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into
            the history of Sinbad the sailor.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘At length in my old age,’ [these are the words of
            Sinbad himself, as retailed by Scheherazade,]—‘at
            length, in my old age, and after enjoying many years
            of tranquility at home, I became once more possessed
            with a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day,
            without acquainting any of my family with my design, I
            packed up some bundles of such merchandize as was
            most precious and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to
            carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to
            await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey
            me out of the kingdom into some region which I had not
            as yet explored.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we
            sat down beneath some trees and looked out into the
            ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship, but during seveal hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied
            that I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound,
            and the porter, after listening awhile, declared that he
            also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and
            then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that
            the object which caused it was approaching us. At
            length, on the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black
            speck, which rapidly increased in size until we made it
            out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part
            of its body above the surface of the sea. It came towards us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge
            waves of foam around its breast, and illuminating all
            that part of the sea through which it passed, with a long
            line of fire that extended far off into the distance.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly.
            Its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees
            that grow, and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent of the
            Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary
            fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness
            throughout all that portion of it which floated above the
            water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak
            that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated
            beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a
            glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with
            the billows, was entirely covered with metallic scales, of
            a colour like that of the moon in misty weather. The
            back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards six spines, about half the length of the whole
            body.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could
            perceive; but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was
            provided with ar least four score of eyes, that protruded
            from their sockets like those of the green dragon-fly, and
            were arranged all around the body in two rows, one
            above the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak,
            which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow.
            Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger
            than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.
         </p>
         
         <p>"‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before
            said, with the greatest rapidity, it must have been
            moved altogether by necromancy—for it had neither fins
            like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like the
            sea-shell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels.
            Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike, only,
            not far from the latter, were two small holes that served
            for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out
            its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a
            shrieking disagreeable noise.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very
            great; but it was even surpassed by our astonishment
            when, upon getting a nearer look, we perceived upon
            the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the
            size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling
            them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),
            being supplied (by nature no doubt) with an ugly, uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so
            tight to the skin as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward and put them apparently to severe pain.
            On the very tips of their heads were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have
            been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I
            therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by
            their great weight, to keep the heads of the animals
            steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around the necks
            of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of
            servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only
            much wider and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in
            any direction without moving the body at the same time;
            and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation
            of their noses—a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively in an awful degree.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore
            where we stood, it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes
            to a great extent, and emitted from it a terrible flash of
            fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke and a noise
            that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the
            smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd man-animals
            standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet
            in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he
            presently addressed us in loud, harsh and disagreeable accents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language had they not come altogether through the nose.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss
            how to reply, as I could in no manner understand what
            was said; and in this difficulty I turned to the porter,
            who was near swooning through affright, and demanded
            of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was,
            what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were
            that so swarmed upon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for trepidation, that he had
            once before heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel
            demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon
            mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin,
            such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little
            larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their
            uses, however evil—for, through the torture they caused
            the beast by their nibblings and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requiste to make
            it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.
         </p>
         
         <p>“‘This account determined me to take to my heels,
            and, without once even looking behind me, I ran at full
            speed up into the hills, while the porter ran equally fast,
            although nearly in an opposite direction, so that, by
            these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took excellent care
            although this is a point I cannot determine, as I do not
            remember that I ever beheld him again.
         </p>
         
         <p>"'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of
            the men-vermin (who had come to the shore in boats)
            that I was very soon overtaken, bound hand and foot,
            and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out
            again into the middle of the sea.
         </p>

            but regret being useless, I made the best of my condition
            and exerted myself to secure the good-will of the mananimal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise authority over its fellows. I succeeded so well in
            this endeavour that, in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of its favour, and, in the end,
            even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of
            what it was vain enough to denominate its language; so
            that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily,

            forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the
            dialect of the Cock-neighs, (so the man-animals were
            called; I presume because their language formed the

            ‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am
            happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a very
            excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which
            is called circumnavigating the globe; and since you are
            so desirous of seeing the world, I will strain a point and

         <p>“It is, in fact, very suprising, my dear queen, that you
            omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do
            you know I think them exceedingly entertaining and
            strange?”

         <p>The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the
            fair Scheherazade resumed her history in the following
            words:—
         </p>
         
         <p>“Sinbad went on in this manner, with his narrative to
            the caliph—‘I thanked the man-animal for its kindness,
            and soon found myself very much at home on the beast,
            which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;
            although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the
            world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so
            that we went—so to say—either up hill or down hill all
            the time.’”
         </p>
         
         <p>“That, I think, was very singular.” interrupted the
            king.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.</p>
         
         <p>“I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; but, pray, be
            so good as to go on with the story.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“I will,” said the queen. ‘The beast,’ continued
            Sinbad to the caliph, ‘swam, as I have related, up hill
            and down hill, until, at length, we arrived at an island,
            many hundreds of miles in circumference, but which,
            nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea
            by a colony of little things like caterpillars.’”

                  a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset

                  the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together
                  with the surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter
                  than even the germen, cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it
                  upon the stigma, as the flower stands always upright till after im-

                  Tipvta Pennirornis, a small insect, which, entering the tube of the

                  other words, to find the best possible position at an infinity of varied
                  distances, and at an infinity of points on the arm. There were a

            the appearance of a fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes upon your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This
            terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive, but
            was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft looking substance,
            smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its
            talons, the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the
            heavens, a house from which it had knocked off the roof,
            and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human
            beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful
            despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We
            shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening
            the bird into letting go of its prey; but it merely gave a
            snort or puff, as if of rage, and then let fall upon our
            heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand.’”

            was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more

            she had iron and brick; her blood, like that of the horse,
            (to whom in fact she was nearly related,) was boiling
            water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black
            stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they took up

            and would be everything that is interesting and beantiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and
            from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save.

            grieved and astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew
            the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity, and quite
            unlikely to forfeit his word, she submitted to her fate
            with a good grace. She derived, however, great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the
            reflection that much of the history remained still untold,
            and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had
            reaped for him a most righteous reward, in depriving

            words on triteness of literary topics, and to plunge at
            once into the midst of things.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Trite”: Tero, terere, trivi, tritum; “To beat, hammer, &amp;c.; or, sometimes, in our more modern sense, “to
            use up.” The definitions are sufficiently correct.
         </p>
         
         <p>All things are used up. All the uses of this world were
            completely used up (and the world itself consequently
            grew seedy) during Hamlet’s terrestrial pilgrimage.—
            But, strange to relate! the matter seems to have been
            laid with a continuando, (as the pleaders say); and said
            uses are even yet signally re-used up, in our present theatrical representations of the above named pilgrimage—
            particularly much about that period of time when we are
            bound to fancy his mother to have gone “post” to incestuous sheets with her new shoes on, and his great progenitor therefore to be about to make infernal peregrinations
            around under the stage, and say something. They were
            at that remote era, weary, stale, prostrate, and, (pecuniarily and in a few other lights contemplated,) might with
            much propriety have been classed, along with lawyers
            and “men of three letters,” among Adam Smith’s unproductives. (Quere as to a question of genesis; what
            successful objection could be raised against the hypothesis, that as said Smith’s name was Adam, so, conversely,
            Adam’s name was probably Smith? The theory would
            be apparently new, and nothing apparently new or original is at this time to be hooted at, even if a little ridiculous). So Gen. Macbeth would seem to have thought,
            when his way of life went down among blasted leaves;
            and in his progresses and fortunes we see most distinctly,
            according to Schlegel, the Fates weaving their dark web
            on the bosom of Time. Seneca somewhere says that a
            man might almost look upon death with indifference,
            on account of the monotony of human affairs—from seeing and hearing and experiencing, day after day, month
            after month, year after year, the same dull, unvarying
            round. “We see the same sights that our fathers have
            seen,” &amp;c. And when we finally come to adduce the veryhighest authority for the assertion that “there is nothing
            new under the sun,” (“under the sun” being in this case
            by no means contractiles or words of limitation, but of definiteness and force, and applicable equally to the moon,)
            We shall have so impregnably fortified our generic position, that if we happen to encounter cavils when predicating the same of specifics, we may retire and syllogistically bid them defiance thus: “all things are used up:
            literary topics (if you please) are things: ergo," &amp;c.—
            The conclusion is irresistible.
         </p>
         
         <p>Well, literary topics are in a used up state. We have
            books and papers upon every imaginable theme; from the
            eternal universe, down through Smollett’s “Atom,” to
            Leibnitz “Monad”; from high Olympus down to sawdust as an edible, including Wordsworth’s beggars, lunatics, old carts and flowers; from Ossian’s roaring Ocean
            down to Park fountains with their presiding deities, to
            poor Wordsworth’s “tear of Gratitude”; from the generations of the Gods of old, down to (illustrious instance
            of the efficacy of Bathos!) Hamadryads and carious teeth
            set in rhyme by a Mr. (suppose we venture to vote this
            last named compound subject decidedly 'done brown’, together with bran-bread and perpetual motion, and propose their being conjointly set aside, as a sort of tripodPharos, to warn the tempest-tossed on the “raging canal”
            of literature, against attempting analogous subjects?)
            from father Saturn through father Æneas directly descending, and the ‘ oldest inhabitant’, down to the great grandchildren of ‘millions yet unborn’.
         </p>
         
         <p>And the writers too, upon all these worn out objects—
            what a mongrel congregation! Combining those of the
            most dissonant ranks, the list extends from Solomon down
            through Ikon basilike James, “Solomon the second”, to
            our contemporary Lowell factory-girls and learned blacksmith; the said blacksmith uniting the very classically
            compatible attributes of a peripatetic Doctor of some thirty or forty different languages, and a manufacturer of
            shovels, hoes, and such like ferruginous curiosities, and
            most likely solving problems that staggered old Scotus
            and Aquinas, as his patron Saint struck out Minerva from
            Jupiter’s cranium—with his sledge-hammer (or axe, as occasion demands). However, let the authors pass for the
            present.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are no heroes, or remarkable specimens of humanity, of ancient or modern times, whose names and qualties have not been used to form the nuclei of prolix histories, or eke out ten thousand verses. Æschylus treated
            Orestes (not Brownson) handsomely; Sophocles varied
            and decidedly failed to improve him; rag-loving Euripides used him up. The Eumenides were hammered out
            at the same time, to save future trouble. Old Mr. Prynne
            used up dramatic heroes and the Drama, what time his
            ears yet rejoiced in their physical integrity. Lord Clarendon, Ormond, and some others, weakened that “certain mechanic fellow by name Oliver Goldsmith,” his
            fair reputation; and it seems to be in a fair way of being
            used up in Westminster, by a kind of “Statuary Oblivion.
            Du Bose beat away “the good Duke” and Prince Eugene,
            to a certain extent, and Southey afterwards lent his partial aid, (simultaneously informing us of the innocence
            of young children, and the fact of sculls having been exhumed on a battle-field) in some lines on Peterkin—or
            something else. Cicero most effectually hammered out
            Catiline, in a series of orations of the most of which he
            never was delivered: and no doubt Sallust thought himself to be damning said Catiline to all posterity, when
            communicating the interesting fact of his pace having
            been sometimes rapid, and at other times tardy. Julius
            Cæsar of Rome began first to beat himself out in his lying Commentaries—in the which work he has been ever
            since indefatigably assisted; and Sir Julius Caesar, Knt.,
            Judge, &amp;c., of England, has been hammered out quite
            successfully by his grand-son, a Mr. Lodge, and divers
            other philanthropists.
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>Sir Julius Cæsar—Heavens! what a name,
            
            <br></br>To fill the speaking trump of future Fame!
         </div>
         
         
         <p>Pilgrims in general have been used up by Bulwer, Bunyan, &amp;c.; the former choosing for the scene of action a
            Dutch river, and the latter the road to Heaven. St. Ambrosius used up Virgins in a formidable, tri-volumed treatise; and thence down to the present time, they have continued to be a pretty favorite topic. Scott the Quaker
            hammered out military effects in the abstract, together
            with an old drum, in an ode instinct with real Vatinian
            affection for them. Cervantes, Hudibras Butler and “Dr.
            Great Unknown” used up Knights-errant, Chivalry and
            scandalized Puritanism, definitively. Bloomfield the shoemaker used the leather to which he was stipulated to be
            confined, in much the same manner as that in which Dido
            and her equally injurious subjects used their bull’s-hide;
            and not adhering to it condensedly, but cutting it out into long, thin strips, and so circumscribing a vasty region,
            he made desultory percursions at his leisure, and sung heroes of Farmer-boys, and collateral subjects. And, by the
            way, (and diverging from our line of heroes, whose complete enumeration would be endless,) this same illustrious Bloomfield, with Theocritus, Thomson, Virgil, Pope,
            (the vigorous personifier of his father Thames’ head,)
            and a few other worthies, have entirely written up the
            country and its appurtenances. Trees and leaves and
            meadows and groves and mountains, and so forth, are become as common as mud. Fatal to try them. As to cities, they are in much the same predicament. E. g. Homer hammered out Troy tolerably well, and Virgil galvanized and re-hammered it out secondarily and forever;
            so that Irish Phillips’ very pathetic interrogatory, in one
            of his universal speeches, as to its present state, might
            be readily and categorically answered. The multiplication of instances of this kind would be superfluous. The
            weather has been used up, from its ante-diluvian condition, down through its effects upon London as specifically
            pointed out in Gay’s Trivia, to its future prospects as all set
            forth in embryo magazine sonnets, yet patiently awaiting
            next Summer’s advent, like spring-traps—or the Duke of
            Wellington’s magnanimous Guards, lying in ambush for
            French cavalry. The Passions—most specially and preeminently that of Love—have been—but heigho! we will
            for the present forbear touching on this subject. Itis big
            with materials enough for another Bodleian Library.
         </p>
         
         <p>In short, we have Essays and Treatises and Histories
            and Poems and Novels and Non-descripts upon every
            theme; and the seeker for a blast from Fame’s golden
            clarion, at this late day, must be wofully puzzled, when
            reflecting upon the means of making her a meet-offering.
            When he comes, in a fit of despair, to decompose existing elements, and attempt their re-composition, he finds
            with dismay that others have been previously engaged in
            the same delightful avocation, for a long succession of
            years; and that the business has been so prosperously
            carried on (and so much more regard paid to the decomposition than the recomposition) that if good mother Nature should happen for one moment to assume the conformation so generously apportioned to her in some of his
            predecessors’ books, she would become in sooth a heterogeneous and inconsistent mass—to the eye a primal Chaos, and to the ear a Pandemonium. He will discover
            that the functions proper of the Imagination have been
            completely discharged, and might as well be blotted out
            forever, like Uncle Toby’s oath. He will be apt to ask,
            ‘What profits it to possess an useless faculty’? And on
            looking about, he will find likewise sterility in every other province.
         </p>
         
         <p>But let us “play, for fun,” that our unfortunate is determined to write upon something, despite its community of treatment; that having devoted long-long years to
            intellectual cultivation, he is urged both by literary pride
            and a despair of success in other walks of life, with
            which he is comparatively unacquainted, to attempt this.
            Very well. He selects a subject, after an infinite deal of
            trouble, and begins it, only to learn that he cannot even
            at the outset treat of it in a manner new and before unused. Let him, for instance, if he be a Poet, undertake
            an Epic. Of course, firstly he wants a worthy Exordium:
            and here he meets a key-note with variations that have
            themselves become monotonous. There are those of “the
            blind old man”—of the Mantuan—of Tasso—of Milton
            (perhaps “the blind young man”, by way of contra-distinction—and whose blindness Johnson thought would
            have been more pitiable if his eyes had been better employed than in the Parliamentary service)—of one old
            Joel Barlow, (tragic name!) and in fine, of an host—
            from all which he can surely choose some one as capitally apposite for his effusions, as Sallust’s Preface is for
            Histories and things in general. Ten chances to one, he
            founders at the beginning.
         </p>
         
         <p>If the opium-eater suffered real misery, when in a vast
            library he could not avoid thinking of the utter futility
            of any endeavor to become acquainted with one half of
            the volumes ranged around him, how must he have been
            affected when pondering the possibility of acquiring distinction by a resort to authorship? He saw, frowning
            upon him, the results of the labors of minds, if not mightier, or more comprehensive, or more poetically attuned,
            than his own, yet which had anticipated him. And he
            speaks bitterly—complainingly—and as at another time
            he probably would not have spoken. He might have
            thought with Voltaire, that it is only in the earlier stages of society, when a large portion of mankind is buried
            in ignorance, that great intellects appear very conspicuous; as the gigantic oak, which, rearing its arduous
            branches solitary on the plain, strikes the beholder with
            admiration, would, if seen in an extensive forest, surrounded with others (although not in all respects its
            equals) scarcely attract a notice. Not that the intellect
            now-a-days is by any means stinted or grown impotent—
            but that it enjoys no solitude of greatness. Not that the
            oak is in the least diminished,—but has become somewhat ordinary, by its relation to a multitude of others.—
            He came into the world, and found it already full of master minds and fluent tongues and rapid pens; and to cope
            with these, he was obliged to resort to labors, which,
            had they been undergone, with equal advantages, a couple
            of centuries before, would have built up a name for him,
            forever. He was unfortunate—but only so by the decree
            of Fate.
         </p>
         
         <p>And yet, after all due allowance made for the great
            number of worthy competitors, he would have found left,
            against which to strive, a certain class, which, although
            as to worth, despicable, is not so as to numbers and its
            means of getting under foot—that glorious, everlasting,
            host of scribblers—that “mob of gentlemen who write
            with ease”—(to themselves, no doubt), and with whom
            we are blessed in great abundance, in this our age of universal erudition. No one would be hardy enough to
            doubt the possession, by each and every of this highly respectable phalanx, of some original idea: but every honest citizen does (or should) doubt the propriety of a dilution of that idea in a Quarto of a thousand pages—of
            the attenuation throughout mortal volumes of what might
            be just as conveniently, and much more intelligibly, exposed, in two or three brief sentences.

         <p>If Tully spoke the truth, when saying of a voluminous
            author of his time, that he could be easily burnt with
            his writings, what magnificent funereal pyres would the
            productions of some of these men make, and to what
            perfect combustion reduce them! Still they insist upon
            getting pregnant with their sickening imbecilities, and
            even upon a premature delivery thereof. “The cry is
            still they come”.—It is said that one old Abbe Du Marolle’s paroxysms on this head were so severe, that having printed up all his manuscripts, he finally fell to printing catalogues of his friends, &amp;c., at his own expense—
            to which catastrophe he was forced by his inexorable
            booksellers; and to which, if some of our aforesaid host
            should be driven, they would perhaps go mad, and thus
            really “do the State some service.” Books and papers
            they seem to feel it their most stringent duty to print,
            and books and papers they do print; helping zealously
            to use things up, each according to his or her several
            ability—(though possibly it is matter of rejoicing that one
            province—that of Classical Literature—is in its nature
            safe from pollution by their Harpy-like quills). And books
            and papers are books and papers; and thousands of wellmeaning persons look at, and sometimes through them,
            because, usurping the place of their betters, they are
            thrust in their faces.

         <p>Kant and his followers, by a keen and discriminating
            system of exclusion, fairly established an exotic school;
            and if there be no extraordinary degree of merit in its
            tenets, at least it cannot easily lead great numbers astray.

            <br></br>For uttered in thy tones benign

         <p>Oinos.—Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit newfledged with immortality!</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for
            which pardon is to be demanded. Not even here is
            knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom ask of the
            angels freely, that it may be given!
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—But in this existence, I dreamed that I should
            be at once cognizant of all things, and thus at once happy
            in being cognizant of all.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in
            the acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we
            are for ever blessed; but to know all were the curse of &amp;
            fiend.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—But does not The Most High know all?</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—That (since he is The Most Happy) must be
            still the one thing unknown even to Him.
         </p>	
         
         <p>Oinos.—But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must
            not at last all things be known?
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—Look down into the abysmal distances!––
            attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas
            of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them thus––and
            thus—and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
            points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies
            that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is
            no dream.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—There are no dreams in Aidenn—but it is
            here whispered that, of this [infinity of matter, the sole
            purpose is to afford infinite springs, at which the soul
            may allay the thirst to know which is for ever unquenchable within it—since to quench it would be to extinguish
            the soul’s self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and
            without fear. Come! we will leave to the left the loud
            harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the
            throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for
            pansies and violets, and heart’s-ease, are the beds of the
            triplicate and triple-tinted suns.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!
            speak to me in the earth’s familiar tones! I understood
            not what you hinted to me, just now, of the modes or of
            the methods of what, during mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the
            Creator is not God?
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—I mean to say that the Deity does not create.</p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—Explain!</p>
         
         
         <p>Agathos.—In the beginning only, he created. The 
            seeming creatures which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing into being, can only be 
            considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or 
            immediate results of the Divine creative power.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be
            considered heretical in the extreme.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be
            simply true.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—I can comprehend you thus far—that certain
            operations of what we term Nature, or the natural laws,
            will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has
            all the appearance of creation. Shortly before the final
            overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember,
            many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of
            animalculæ.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—The cases of which you speak were, in fact,
            instances of the secondary creation—and of the only species of creation which has ever been, since the first word
            spoke into existence the first law.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss
            of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not
            these stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the 
            King?
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you,
            step by step, to the conception I intend. You are well
            aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for example,
            when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing,
            we gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.
            This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth’s air, which thenceforward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement 
            of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe
            well knew. They made the special effects, indeed,
            wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of
            exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine in
            what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the
            atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no
            difficulty, from a given effect, under given conditions, in
            determining the value of the original impulse. Now the
            mathematicians who saw that the results of any given
            impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw that a
            portion of these results were accurately traceable through
            the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same
            time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself
            a capacity for indefinite progress—that there were no
            bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability,
            except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—Because there were some considerations of
            deep interest, beyond. It was deducible from what they
            knew, that to a being of infinite understanding—one to
            whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
            given the air—and the ether through the air—to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch
            of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;—and the
            being of infinite understanding—the being whom we have
            imagined—might trace the remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and onward in their influences
            upon all particles of all matter—upward and onward for
            ever in their modifications of old forms—or in in other
            words, in their creation of new—until he found them reflected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of
            the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,
            but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him
            —should one of these numberless comets, for example, be
            presented to his inspection,—he could have no difficulty
            in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what
            original impulse it was due. This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this faculty of
            referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is of
            course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every
            variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the
            power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic
            Intelligences.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.
            
         </p>
         <p>Agathos.—In speaking of the air, I referred only to the
            earth:—but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether—which, since it pervades, and
            alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
            creation.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates.</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—It must: but a true philosophy has long
            taught that the source of all motion is thought—and the
            source of all thought is—
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—God.</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of
            the fair Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon
            the atmosphere of the Earth.
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—You did.</p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—And while I thus spoke, did there not cross
            your mind some thought of the physical power of words?
            Is not every word an impulse on the air?
         </p>
         
         <p>Oinos.—But why, Agathos, do you weep?—and why—
            oh why do your wings droop as we hover above this lair
            star—which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all
            we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant flowers
            look like a fairy dream—but its fierce volcanoes like the
            passions of a turbulent heart.
         </p>
         
         <p>Agathos.—They are!—they are! This wild star—it
            is now three centuries since with clasped hands, and with
            streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved—I spoke it—
            with a few passionate sentences—into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and
            its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts.

            <br></br>In early years, when quite a boy,
            
            <br></br>I had a dream of sweet import,
            
            <br></br>’Twas full of deep and tranquil joy—
            
            <br></br>A fancy only—scarce a thought.
            
            <br></br>I know not how it form’d or grew,
            
            <br></br>And yet 'twas with me day and night;
            
            <br></br>With sunny hair and eyes ot blue,
            
            <br></br>A thing of shadow and of light!
            
            <br></br>So dim—uncertain—yet so fair—
            
            <br></br>No thing of substance, nor of air!
            
            <br></br>Those eyes of blue, that golden hair,
            
            <br></br>Haunted my young heart everywhere.
            
            <br></br>Youth came—and childhood’s dreams were o’er;
            
            <br></br>Experience told me they were vain;
            
            <br></br>Yet still the dream I dream’d of yore,
            
            <br></br>Returned and haunted me again.
            
            
            <br></br>My mind was full of wild romance,
            
            <br></br>Which reason scarcely could control,
            
            <br></br>And this sweet dream served to enhance
            
            <br></br>The unquiet yearnings of my soul.
            
            <br></br>I asked my heart what it could be,
            
            <br></br>This sweet and moat strange mystery?
            
            <br></br>Which, like some old loved melody
            
            <br></br>Heard in oar youth, returns to me?
            
            <br></br>My youth has flown, as birds take wing,
            
            <br></br>Romance to truth has yielded place;
            
            <br></br>Yet ever and anon will spring
            
            <br></br>The memory of that angel face.
            
            <br></br>In the belief can there be truth?
            
            <br></br>That two are formed to meet and love;
            
            <br></br>That dreami which haunt us in our youth
            
            <br></br>In after years will real prove!
            
            <br></br>If true I shall not always pine,

         <div class="head">Incidents of College Life.</div>
         
         <p>The entrance of a new member to a class in College,
            is a fruitful source of speculation and conjecture. Everybody must know where he is from, who are his friends,
            into what circle of society he will be likely to fall, and
            every thing about his habits and character which can be
            gathered from those who ever heard of him, or his relatives.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was one day in the spring term of our sophomore
            year, that report said a man from A–––––––, S. C., had been
            admitted to our class, and the usual curiosity to see him
            was manifested. His first appearance among us was at
            prayers in the chapel. It was such as to prepossess one
            in his favor, and bespoke him a cordial welcome; and
            those who pretended to most discernment in such matters, and take it upon them to utter public opinion as if
            it had its origin with them, whispered many brilliant
            things about the new comer, and spoke of him in terms
            almost of admiration. There were others, however, who,
            though they took no particular interest in an early acquaintance with their new classmate, thought they saw
            a covertness and insincerity in his countenance, but they
            were by no means confident enough of the correctness of
            their opinion to express it, but were willing that his character should in due time appear in his actions.
         </p>
         
         <p>Time passed, and Bertram was no longer a stranger,
            but became one of us, and the circumstance of his having
            but lately entered the class was forgotten. Indeed, he
            was becoming exceedingly popular; for he proved to be
            a man of engaging manners, liberal principles, artful in
            his schemes, and possessing withal considerable acquaintance with human nature. He seemed to possess a kind
            of second sight, by which he never failed to predict the
            popular side of every question, and was sure to be among
            its earliest advocates.
         </p>
         
         <p>For reasons not necessary here to state, our Professor in
            Latin became somewhat unpopular with a part of the
            class; and one of the ways in which this manifested itself was, that the moment the hour specified for the recitation by the College laws had expired,
            according to the time kept by the students themselves,
            there was an unaccountable movement of feet, which increased to such a degree, as to render very unpleasant
            any further procedure with the lesson, if a little of it
            chanced not to have been recited. This was continued,
            to the great annoyance of many of the class, who felt
            more anxiety to acquire a knowledge of Latin than to
            vex the Professor, and show that little spite which those
            indulging it would not dare gratify in an open, and manly
            way.
         </p>
         
         <p>As might be supposed, Burtram was bitter toward the
            offending officer; no one more proudly set his authority at defiance, or applied to him more abusive epithets,
            though it was whispered that no one seemed more openhearted and friendly in his presence, or acted the hypocrite with more perfect success.
         </p>
         
         <p>Burtram’s boots were singularly quiet when he was so
            situated that the Professor could have the slightest suspicion of him, if they clamored at all; but if he was well
            concealed, they hammered the floor with an energy worthy a better cause.
         </p>
         
         <p>My friend, Cheever, usually sat directly behind Burtram, and was not more disturbed by his noise than disgusted by his duplicity; and he at last declared to me, if
            he was called to recite, and was thus interrupted, he
            would expose the first man he saw out of order. He well
            knew that he would thus bring upon himself the unmitigated abuse of the disaffected part of the class; but he
            denied their right to deprive him of the advantages of recitation, just because he happened to stand a few moments beyond the allotted hour, shortened, as it frequently was, by their impatience.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cheever was a quiet and unassuming man, a real enthusiast in his studies, and excelled in every department,
            but was never supposed to be capable of acting with
            much decision in resenting an injury.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was at the very next recitation that he was called
            to read the last passage in the lesson, and before he had
            completed it, the usual confusion commenced. Cheever
            endured it for a moment, raising his voice as the noise
            increased; but suddenly fixing his eyes upon his next
            neighbor, who was laboring away with his usual zeal
            he exclaimed, “Burtram, stop that noise, or I’ll report
            you!”
         </p>
         
         <p>In an instant there was a perfect silence. All were astonished at the suddenness of so singular an exclamation,
            coming, as it did, from such an unexpected source.—
            Meanwhile Cheever proceeded to complete his recitation
            at his leisure; and what was better still, no one was
            troubled any further in the same way.
         </p>
         
         <p>As was anticipated, Burtram declared the measure of
            Cheever a base insult to the class, and to himself in particular, and vowed consummate revenge.
         </p>
         
         <p>We now pass over the history of more than a year—
            during which time all things moved on as usual, and the
            occurrence above mentioned had been forgotten as such
            things are in College, being made the subject of remark only a few days, and then are succeeded by some
            other excitement, perhaps of a different nature.
         </p>
         
         <p>Burtram found no way in which he could come in collision with Cheever, who maintained his quiet, studious
            habits, and was daily gaining friends, as he gradually
            mingled more in society,—though as affairs were evidently turning, there was no prospect of his coming into
            favor with Burtram, for he was now looked upon by him
            in the light of a rival,—and to see a man of Cheever’s
            character and habits rise above him, was more than he
            could submit to.
         </p>
         
         <p>There had been for some time much noise at unseasonable hours in a room directly over Cheever’s, greatly to
            his disturbance, as well as all others in the vicinity. He
            endured it till his patience was gone, for he was the principal sufferer, and finally went to the disturbers of his
            peace, among whom he found Burtram, and asked them
            to refrain from thus interrupting his studies, saying at
            the same time, he was sorry to be obliged to make any
            such request, but he felt it due to himself and his interests as a scholar. No attention whatever was paid to
            this request, gentlemanly and kind as it was, but the offence, which was a direct violation of the laws of college,
            continued as frequent as ever.
         </p>
         
         <p>Cheever once more took occasion, after having lost
            some hours of study, one night to go and say to the offenders, that as a last resort, he would certainly report them
            to the college authorities, if there was another occasion
            of the kind; for he would not pay his money and spend
            his time, to be wasted by others’ amusements, to an extent so unreasonable, and he thus stated plainly his intention, that it might not be said he did it in secret, if he
            was so unhappy as to be obliged to do it.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was not long after, when, one dark, stormy night,
            after all had been still for some time, there commenced
            the usual noise, loud talking, singing, boisterous laughing,
            and all the accompaniments of a ‘ college row.’ Cheever
            felt sufficiently provoked for the fulfilment of his promise, and he was ready for it. Throwing his cloak
            about him he quietly left the building, and made his way
            in the dark to the study of an officer of College, and just
            said to him his presence was needed at No.—,––––Hall;
            and returned so soon that his absence was not discovered. It was effectual to the breaking up of the party, but
            no persons were discovered in the room but the occupants, when the officer arrived, for they suddenly dispersed as soon as his footsteps were heard in the Hall.
         </p>
         
         <p>The next morning Cheever was sent for by Prof. H., to
            come to his study. He was well aware of the errand,
            and determined to make it an object, first to find out
            what the Professor actually knew about the matter, before he was asked any questions.
         </p>
         
         <p>He discovered that the names of the offenders were
            mostly known, and to his utter astonishment, found that
            Bertram was the voluntary informer, which fact was evident from a remark accidentally dropped by the Professor.
            It was enough! Cheever told the Professor that he was
            in possession of more information than he could have
            communicated, and was allowed to retire.
         </p>
         
         <p>He saw that since it had been his avowed determination to report the offenders and that openly, Bertram, to
            screen himself and gratify a long sought revenge, had
            reported the whole story concerning his associates, feeling confident his name would never be given as the author of the information, and that it would be perfectly
            easy to charge it off upon Cheever, and brand his character with a mean and cowardly act. He now had the key
            to the whole affair, and determined, since he had gone
            thus far, to keep the secret till he was obliged to disclose
            it.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was soon known among us that the connection of
            these individuals with the College, must temporarily
            cease, and it created not a little excitement. They were
            persons who had many friends, and it was strongly contended that they done nothing worthy of such severity,
            and that it was the result of false information given to
            the Faculty. Among their defenders Bertram was foremost, and he with others, diligently circulated the name
            of Cheever as the author of all the mischief, proving it
            by every circumstance that could favor the suspicion.
         </p>
         
         <p>It was with a high degree of satisfaction that he with
            his friends proved out the comparative innocence of the
            suspended ones, and showed the guilt of so representing
            their (light offence as to bring upon them such a sentence, always concluding with charging it all to Cheever’s account, until it came to be generally believed he
            was guilty of a great wrong. There is no moderation in
            College excitements, they run like a wild tempest, though
            they are generally soon over. Cheever’s friends were at
            a loss what to say, and thought his case a hard one. So
            strong was the sympathy for the ‘suspended,’ that a
            class meeting was called, to draw up a petition to the
            Faculty in their behalf.
         </p>
         
         <p>Prompt to the hour, the class were present, almost to a
            man, though a few dropped in afterwards, and Cheever
            among them. I feared for him when I saw him enter,
            for most looked upon him with bitter accusations; but
            he was calm and undisturbed as if nothing had happened.
         </p>
         
         <p>Burtram, always forward in such matters, spoke first.
            He stated the case of his suspended friends with great
            feeling, showed in strong light the palliating circumstances to be set forth in the petition, and closed by saying, “The elements of mischief are yet among us; there
            are those of our own number—we hope they are few, and
            expect them to be fewer—who, for the paltry consideration of a factitious esteem with the Faculty, have not
            only reported the innocent amusements of a few friends,
            but have so done it, as to convey a false and exaggerated
            notion of the extent to which the laws have been violated, and have thus procured this unjust sentence! I say
            we have those–––I correct myself—we have one among
            us of this character, and I appeal to gentlemen of the
            class to say in what light such an one should be regarded”?
         </p>
         
         <p>The common opinion of one class of the students, made
            up from the reports in circulation, and the unblushing
            assurance with which these charges were made, were
            enough to fasten suspicion, and fix all eyes upon Cheever.
            This he perceived, and rose to reply, amid the half suppressed hisses of his enemies, yet with a cool, undisturbed air, as one who was fully assured of the justice of
            his cause. He stated the history of the whole matter
            from the beginning in a plain and simple way, and added, “If to persist in claiming my right to my time undisturbed, as guarantied by the College laws—if to inform the authorities concerned of the violation of those
            rights after using every other method in my power to
            prevent their infraction is wrong, I am guilty; for though
            I made no such report, (because it was made by another)
            I fully intended to do it.”
         </p>
         
         <p>At this point Burtram evinced great perturbation, so
            much as to excite the surprise of all, and particularly of
            his friends; and he turned deadly pale as Cheever, casting a withering glance upon him, exclaimed, “You ‘blue
            skin’! I charge upon you the meanness of being the unprovoked, voluntary reporter of the faults of your own
            friends—faults, too, in which you can truly say, ‘pars
            magna fui”—and this you did to screen yourself, that you
            might escape * unwhipped of justice.’ I charge upon you
            the attempt, so far apparently successful to implicate me
            in the guilt that defiles your own character, thinking you
            was safe from detection. All this I charge upon you.—
            I do it publicly, and fearlessly; and deny it if you can"!
         </p>
         
         <p>A thunder-clap in a clear sky could not have been more
            astounding than this information. We looked at each
            other, and then at Burtram, to see if he was not about to
            reply, but his mouth was shut. The truth had met him
            at a terrible moment, and his humiliation was complete.
         </p>
         
         <p>The meeting adjourned, but Burtram could never afterward look a man of us in the face; and in a few days his
            place was vacant, and he was no wore numbered among
            us.

            <p>The Songs of our Land and Other Poems. By Mary L.
               Hewitt. Boston. William D. Ticknor &amp; Co.
            </p>
            
            <p>In point of external taste, this is the most exquisite volume of poems published in America since “The Spanish
               Student,” of Longfellow. The unusual width of the page
               is especially to our fancy, and the general arrangement
               of the matter could not be improved. The small pica
               type, however, is perhaps a trifle too large for the size of
               the page.
            </p>
            
            <p>The volume contains fifty pieces, of course varied in
               excellence, but all speaking, in unmistakeable terms, of
               the author’s poetic fervor, classicism of taste, and keen
               appreciation of the morally as well as physically beautiful. No one can read the book without a desire to become acquainted with the woman.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mrs. Hewitt has evidently a strong partiality for the
               sea—and this partiality has given color to some of the
               most forcible, although, in our opinion, by no means the
               most generally meritorious compositions in the volume.
               “The Yarn,” we believe, is a favorite with its author,
               and is certainly replete with vigorous thought and expression. “God Bless The Mariner,” we quote as the best
               of this species of poem to he found in the collection.
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>God’s blessing on the Mariner!
               
               <br></br>A venturous life leads he—
               
               <br></br>What reck the landsmen of their toil,
               
               <br></br>Who dwell upon the sea?
               
               <br></br>The landsman sits within his home,
               
               <br></br>His fireside bright and warm;
               
               <br></br>Nor asks how fares the mariner
               
               <br></br>All night amid the storm.
               
               <br></br>God bless the hardy Mariner!
               
               <br></br>A homely garb wears he,
               
               <br></br>And he goeth with a rolling gait,
               
               <br></br>Like a ship upon the sea.
               
               <br></br>He hath piped the loud “ay! ay sir!"
               
               <br></br>O’er the voices of the main,
               
               <br></br>Till his deep tones have the hoarseness
               
               <br></br>Of the rising hurricane.
               
               <br></br>His seamed and honest visage
               
               <br></br>The sun and wind have tanned,
               
               <br></br>And hard as iron gauntlet
               
               <br></br>Is his broad and sinewy hand.
               
               <br></br>But oh! a spirit looketh
               
               <br></br>Lrom out his clear, blue eye,
               
               <br></br>With a truthful, childlike earnestness,
               
               <br></br>Like an angel from the sky.
               
               <br></br>A venturous life the sailor leads
               
               <br></br>Between the sky and sea—
               
               <br></br>But when the hour of dread is past,
               
               <br></br>A merrier who, than he?
               
               <br></br>He knows that by the rudder bands
               
               <br></br>Stands one well skilled to save;
               
               <br></br>For a strong hand is the Steersman’s
               
               <br></br>That directs him o’er the wave.
            </div>
            
            <p>“Alone” evinces, we think, more of the true poetic inapiration—and undoubtedly more of originality in conception than any other of Mrs. Hewitt’s poems. We copy it
               in full:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>There lies a deep and seated well
               
               <br></br>Within yon leafy forest hid;
               
               <br></br>Whose pent and lonely waters swell,
               
               <br></br>Its confines chill and drear amid.
               
               <br></br>It hears the birds on every spray
               
               <br></br>Trill forth melodious notes of love—
               
               <br></br>It feels the warm sun’s seldom ray
               
               <br></br>Glance on the stone its wave above—
               
               <br></br>And quick the gladdened waters rush
               
               <br></br>Tumultuous upward to the brink;
               
               <br></br>A seal is on their joyous gush,
               
               <br></br>And back, repressed, they coldly shrink.
               
               <br></br>Thus in their caverned space, apart.
               
               <br></br>Closed from the eye of day, they dwell—
               
               <br></br>So, prisoned deep within my heart,
               
               <br></br>The tides of quick affection swell.
               
               <br></br>Each kindly glance—each kindly tone,
               
               <br></br>To joy its swift pulsations sway;
               
               <br></br>But none may lifl the veiling stone,
               
               <br></br>And give the franchised current way.
               
               <br></br>Smite thou the rock, whose eye alone,
               
               <br></br>The hidden spring within may see;
               
               <br></br>And bid the flood, resistless one!
               
               <br></br>Flow forth, rejoicing, unto thee.
            </div>
            
            <p>The pieces, however, which will prove most decidedly
               popular with men of taste, and which, upon the whole,
               convey the most pleasing impression of the author’s ability, are the three sonnets entitled Cameos.. We make
               no apology for quoting them:
            </p>
            
            <div class="lg">
               <br></br>I.
               
               <br></br>With springing hoof that would the earth disdain,
               
               <br></br>Broad, swelling chest, and limb with motion rife,
               
               <br></br>From Lapithæan banquet and the strife,
               
               <br></br>Fleetly he bounds along Thessalia’s plain.
               
               <br></br>And on his back, in rude embrace entwined.
               
               <br></br>A captive bride he bears. Her trait’rous veil
               
               <br></br>Reveals her brow, as Juno’s roses pale,
               
               <br></br>And floats like scarf of Iris on the wind.
               
               <br></br>And vainly struggling ’gainst that bold caress,
               
               <br></br>Her outstretched arms essay the air to grasp;
               
               <br></br>But firm the captor holds his iron clasp,
               
               <br></br>And strives, with ruthless lip, her lip to press.
               
               <br></br>Thus vice hath power to sway the feeble soul,
               
               <br></br>And bear it on in measureless control.

               <br></br>Reclined enervate on the couch of ease,
               
               <br></br>No more he pants for deeds of high emprise;
               
               <br></br>For pleasure holds in soft, voluptuous ties
               
               <br></br>Enthrall’d, great Jove-descended Hercules.

               <br></br>Hesperia’s dragon slew, with bold intent—
               
               <br></br>That from his quivering side in triumph rent
               
               <br></br>The skin the Cleenæan lion wore,
               
               <br></br>Holds forth the goblet—while the Lydian queen
               
               <br></br>Robed like a nymph, her brow enwreathed with Vine-
               
               <br></br>Lifts high the amphora, brimmed with rosy wine,
               
               <br></br>And pours the draught the crownéd cup within.
               
               <br></br>And thus the soul, abased to sensual sway,
               
               <br></br>Its worth forsakes—its might foregoes for aye.
               
               <br></br>III.
               
               <br></br>Oh! wondrous marvel of the sculptor’s art!
               
               <br></br>What cunning hand hath culled thee from the mine,
               
               <br></br>And carved thee into life, with skill divine!
               
               <br></br>How claims in thee humanity a part—
               
               <br></br>Seems from the gem the form enchained, to start,
               
               <br></br>While thus with fiery eye, and outspread wings,
               
               <br></br>The ruthless vulture to his victim clings,
               
               <br></br>With whetted beak deep in the quivering heart.
               
               <br></br>Oh! thou embodied meaning, master wrought!
               
               <br></br>Thus taught the sage, how, sunk in crime and sin,
               
               <br></br>The soul a prey to conscience, writhes within
               
               <br></br>Its fleshly bonds enslaved:–thus ever, THOUGHT,
               
               <br></br>The breast’s keen torturer, remorseful tears
               
               <br></br>At life, the hell whose chain the soul in anguish wears.

            <p>Of these sonnets we much prefer the “Hercules and
               Omphale.” It is full of a truly classic grace—both of
               thought and expression, and would do honor to any poet
               in the land. It has that common fault of American Sonnets—the fault of a termination feeble in comparison with
               the body of the poem—but even in this respect, it is superior to most compositions of the kind. Its general versification is worthy of all praise; we have rarely, if ever,
               seen it surpassed. Such lines as

            </p>
            
            <p>Upon the whole, we are favorably impressed with the

            <p>Morse's Cerographic Maps. No. 1. New-York. Harper &amp; Brothers, 82 Cliff-street.</p>
            
            <p>We look upon this enterprise as one of the most important, if not the most important, ever undertaken by an
               American publisher. The plan of the publication is as
               follows:
            </p>
            
            <p>1. The size of the Maps will be about 15 inches by 12.</p>
            
            <p>2. The subjeets illustrated will embrace the whole field of Ancient and Modern, including Sacred Geography, Chronology, and
               History.
            </p>
            
            <p>3.	The work will be edited by Sidney E. Morse, A. M., and
               when finished, it is intended, shall be a Universal Atlas in the
               most comprehensive sense of the term.
            </p>
            
            <p>4.	Each number will contain four colored Maps, the price of
               which will be twenty-five cents, being about one-fourth the cost of
               copperplate Maps of a similar size.
            </p>
            
            <p>5. More than forty Maps are already engraved, consisting chiefly of countries in North America, and embracing separate Maps
               of nearly every State in the Union.
            </p>
            
            <p>6.	The American Maps have been prepared with great care, and
               to a great extent from new and original materials, collected during the last four years by Samuel Breese, A. M., from a correspondence embracing more than 2000 letters and several hundred
               manuscript local maps.
            </p>
            
            <p>7. Many thousand dollars and years of labor, having been devoted to perfecting the new art by which these maps are executed,
               as well as in collecting and arranging the valuable information
               they contain, the publishers confidently rely upon the most extended patronage for the work.
            </p>
            
            <p>8.	If practicable, from two to three numbers will be issued every
               month.
            </p>
            
            <p>9.	The first ten numbers will form a comprehensive and elegant
               North American Atlas for the Library, the Counting House and
               the School Room.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Contents of No. 1 embrace the Indian Territory,
               Northern Texas, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Michigan and
               Arkansas. The price of each number is 25 cents. Nothing can exceed the beauty and accuracy of the whole
               work.

            <p>This is one of the most truly beautiful volumes ever
               issued even from the press of the Appletons. It is a duodecimo of neariy 600 pages, exquisitely printed on very
               fine paper, embellished with a dozen carefully engraved
               plates from Flaxman’s inimitable designs, and the whole
               tastefully and durably bound. The title fully conveys
               the contents of the book, with the exception of the frontispiece—which is a likeness of Dante, engraved by Philli- brown, from the “last portrait,” by Giotto. This picture
               was discovered in the ancient castle of the Podesta, at
               Florence, in July, 1840. When found, it was encrusted
               with whitewash.

         <p>We have been quizzing the Bostonians, and one or two
            of the more stupid of their editors and editresses have
            taken it in high dudgeon. We will attend to them all in
            good time.
         </p>
         
         <p>We make room, with much pleasure, for the following
            explanation:
         </p>
         To the Editor of the Broadway Journal:
         
         <p>Sir—A copy of your Journal dated October 4th, was handed me
            this evening, containing some observations respecting alterations
            made in the song oi Ben Bolt, to which some music was adapted
            by J. P. Webster. The facts were as follows. The song was in
            a New-Haven paper, and came into my hands as an envelope. It
            was without signature or reference of any kind, to the author. I
            was pleased with the poetry, and gave it to Mr. Webster, as he said
            he would compose some music for it. Before he had completed it,
            he lost the copy, and asked if I could give him another from memory. The words published were written down by two or three persons, as no one remembered the whole. As Mr. W. did not know
            the author’s name, he could not of course give it. But from what
            I know of him, I am certain that no thoughts of claiming the authorship ever crossed his mind; and what may so appear in the
            publication, is the result of carelessness.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having been (though indirectly) the cause of the censure cast
            upon Mr. Webster, I felt bound to make this statement, which I
            doubt not you will have the justice to publish. I am ready to give
            satisfactory reference, if you require it.

            <p>THIS valuable new production, from the pen of
                one of the most eminent scholars of the age,
               exhibits, in a most lucid, exact, and elegant style,
               the great principles of moral, political, and ecclesiastical science in a far more complete and methodical manner than has ever yet been presented to the
                public. In offering this great work to the American
               reader, the publisher begs leave to introduce it as
               the commencement of a new and attractive series
               of sterling books, to be issued by them, under the
               general designation of

               to the million, the fullest advantages of popular instruction in the various divisions of human knowledge, is the design of the above series. It is apparent in the present day, that books of intrinsic value
               are demanded by the people. Formerly the popular taste preferred mainly works of mere amusement
               —the great body of readers now seek them as vehicles of general knowledge-books of a mote permanently valuable caste—devoted to some of the
               departments of science, or general literature. A
               new race has sprung up, glowing with the first
               energies of youth, requiring more expanded ideas
               of the world in which they live, and a more reliable
               and well-digested knowledge of the men. and the
               events of other times and countries. A class of
               books expressly adapted to this demand, it is the
               aim of the publishers to supply; and at a price so
               exceedingly cheap that every person of ordinary
               taste and advantages may thus become possessed

            <p>In this collection it is intended to include the best
               productions in every department of knowledge;
               popular philosophical treatises on topics of universal interest; the most compact and brilliant historical books; valuable biographical memoirs; modern
               voyages and travels, Sic.; together with scientific
               and other collateral divisions; in the selection of
               all which, the most careful discrimination will be
               observed A mere glance over the wide domain of
               tour English literature will exhibit much yet unexplored and uncultivated, from which might be ga thered the fruits of a rich, luxuriant harvest; besides
               which, the ever-teeming issues of the European
               press open a vast revenue of literary wealth, from
               which the above collection may be liberally supplied. Original productions from American writers
               will also occasionally be introduced In submitting,
               therefore, the esteemed work of Prof. Whewell
               as a kind of first-fruits of their “New Miscellany,”
               the publishers deem it only necessary to add, that
               their arrangements for carrying forward the enterprise being of the most complete and efficient kind,
               they confidently rely upon their efforts being met
               with a ready response from the entire reading community.

            <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:–Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making
               a professional use of your Harps, and of 
               testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone
               workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stand proof
               against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the
               most entire satisfaction.  
               January, 1845	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
            </p>
            
            <p>Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of Harps
               at Sig. Casella's Concert in this city.--
               The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I
               have heard for many years.  
               Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps,	indeed he himself used no
               other. Yours, most truly H. G. Trust. 
               Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.
            </p>	
            
            <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—I have much pleasure in saying that the Harp of your make I
               performed on at the St. George's Society
               Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship the finest
               I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps. 
               The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours,
               with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN 
               New York, January 16th, 1845.     A pupil of N. C. Boscha.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:--Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action
               Harps, I find they possess the best qualities of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch by which the
               most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
               ease of modulation, they arc superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior
               must gratify the most refined taste. Your new 
               Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced
               in the musical world; it will giveme great pleasure
               in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.		Yours Truly, Henry Horn. January 12th, 1845		An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.

            its way, perforating the trunk of the tree until it reaches the root, it
            then comes out of the root, and dies, or remains dormant, and the
            plant propagates out of its head; the body remains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From this insect the
            natives make a coloring for tatooing.”
            In mines and natural caves we find a species of crytogamous
            fungus that emits an intense phosphorescence.

         <a href="/#/issues/18451025/p2">“The corolla of this flower, (Aristolochia Clemalitis,) which is
            tubular, but terminating upwards in a lingulae limb, is inflated into
            a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset
            with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains
            the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together
            with the surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter
            than even the germen, cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it
            upon the stigma, as the flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without some additional and peculiar aid,
            the pollen must necessarily fall down to the bottom of the flower.
            Now, the aid that Nature has furnished in this case, is that of the
            Tipvta Pennirornis, a small insect, which, entering the tube of the
            corolla in quest of honey, descends to the bottom, and rumages
            about till it becomes quite covered with pollen; but, not being able
            to force its way out again, owing to the downward position of the
            hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap,
            and being somewhat impatient of its confinement, it brushes backwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop
            and the hairs to shrink to the side of the tube, effecting an easy pas
            sage for the escape of the insect.”—Rev. P. Keith—“Sydom of
            Physiological Botany."

            cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the

            the most room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.
            During the latter part of the last century, the question arose 
            among mathematicians—“o determine the best form that can be
            given to the sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of revolution.” This is an excessively complex problem; for it is, in 
            other words, to find the best possible position at an infinity of varied
            distances, and at an infinity of points on the arm. There were a
            thousand futile attempts to answer the query on the part of the most
            illustrious mathematicians; and when, at length, an undeniable
            solution was discovered, men found that the wings of a bird had
            given it with absolute precision, ever since the first bird had traversed the air.
