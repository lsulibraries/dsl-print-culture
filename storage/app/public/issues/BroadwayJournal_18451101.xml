            Sonnet
            Over the mountain tops, at close of day,
            The golden glory of the sun departs;
            While life’s fresh years are passing swift away
            So fades youth’s sunshine from our living hearts,
            And Innocence—and trustful Truth—that went—
            Pure-handed sisters—with the soul along,
            And cheered the way with gentle blandishment,
            With Faith and Hope have sighed their farewell song!
            Faintly the echo lingers—less and less—
            In vain the weeping soul implores its stay;
            Still doomed to walk in doubt and bitterness,
            
         </p>
         <p>Across the arid waste her dismal way;
            To the goal pressing, where the weary slave
            May find a rest—a birthright claim—the grave!

            Some Words with a Mummy.
            
         </p>
         <p>The symposium of the preceding evening had been a
            little too much for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy. Instead of going
            out, therefore, to spend the evening as I had proposed, it
            occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than
            just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to
            bed.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>A. light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of
            Welsh rabbit. More than a pound at once, however,
            may not at all times be advisable. Still, there can be
            no material objection to two. And really between two
            and three, there is merely a single unit of difference. I
            Ventured, perhaps, upon four. My wife will have it
            five;—but, clearly, she has confounded two very distinct
            affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown
            Stout, without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh
            rabbit is to be eschewed.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my
            night-cap,with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon
            the next day, I placed my head upon the pillow, and
            through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I
            could not have completed my third snore when there
            came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then
            an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened
            me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was
            still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note
            from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran thus:
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Come to me by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you
            receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of
            the City Museum, to my examination of the Mummy—you know
            the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it and open it, if
            desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of course.
            The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll
            it at eleven to-night	Yours ever,
         </p>
         <p>Ponnonner.
            
         </p>
         <p>By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck
            me that I was as wide awake as a man need be. I leaped
            out of bed in an ecstasy, overthrowing all in my way;
            dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and
            set off, at the top of my speed, for the Doctor’s.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There I found a very eager company assembled. They
            had been awaiting me with much impatience; the
            Mummy was extended upon the dining table; and the
            moment I entered, its examination was commenced.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It was one of a pair brought, several years previously,
            by Captain Arthur Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s,
            from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian Mountains,
            a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile. The
            grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than
            the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the
            private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from which
            our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in
            such illustrations; the walls being completely covered
            with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues,
            vases, and Mosaic work of rich patterns, indicated the
            vast wealth of the deceased.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in which Captain Sabretash
            had found it;–that is to say, the coffin had not been
            disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood, subject
            only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those
            who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once,
            that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon
            our good fortune.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or
            case, nearly seven feet long, and perhaps three feet wide,
            by two feet and a half deep. It was oblong—not coffinshaped. The material was at first supposed to be the
            wood of the sycamore (platanus), but, upon cutting into
            it, we found it to be pasteboard, or more properly, papier maché, composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes,
            and other mournful subjects, interspersed among which
            in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical characters intended, no doubt, for the name of
            the departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of
            our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the
            letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the
            word, Allamistakeo.
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page252"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury, but, having at length accomplished the task,
            we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one, but resembling it
            precisely in every other respect. The interval between
            the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree,
            defaced the colors of the interior box.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily,)
            we arrived at a third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that
            of its material, which was cedar, and still emitted
            the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood.
            Between the second and the third case there was no interval; the one fitting accurately within the other.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Removing the third case, we discovered and took out
            the body itself. We had expected to find it, as usual,
            enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen, but,
            in place of these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt
            and painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul,
            and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably,
            as portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from
            head to foot, was a columnar, or perpendicular inscription
            in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving again his name and
            titles, and the names and titles of his relations.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse in color, and so arranged as
            to form images of deities, of the scarabæus, etc., with
            the winged globe. Around the small of the waist was a
            similar collar, or belt.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no perceptible odor. The color
            was reddish. The skin was hard, smooth and glossy.
            The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes
            (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like,
            with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare.
            The finger and the nails were brilliantly gilded.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the
            epidermis, that the embalment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with
            a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of
            the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and
            other sweet-scented gums became apparent.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual
            openings through which the entrails are extracted, but,
            to our surprise, we could discover none. No member of
            the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not unfrequently met. The brain it
            was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body was
            then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly
            so called, began.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor
            Ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection,
            when I observed that it was then past two o’clock.
            Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were, about to
            separate for the present, when some one suggested an
            experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The application of electricity to a Mummy three or
            four thousand years old at the least, was an idea, if not
            very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught
            at it at once. About one tenth in earnest and nine tenths
         </p>
         <p>in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study,
            and conveyed thither the Egyptian.
            
         </p>
         <p>It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in
            laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which
            appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the
            frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave
            no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in
            contact with the wire. This the first trial, indeed,
            seemed decisive, and, with a hearty laugh at our own
            absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when
            my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy,
            were there immediately riveted in amazement. My
            brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the
            orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and which
            were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were
            now so far covered by the lids that only a small portion
            of the tunica albuginea remained visible.
         </p>
         <p>With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it be-
            came immediately obvious to all.
            
         </p>
         <p>I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon,
            because “alarmed” is, in my case, not exactly the word.
            It is possible, however, that, but for the Brown Stout, I
            might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of the
            company, they really made no attempt at concealing the
            downright fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr. Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that
            he made his way, upon all fours, under the table.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course, upon farther experiment
            forthwith. Our operations were now directed against the
            great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over the
            outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis, and
            thus got at the root of the abductor muscle. Re-adjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected
            nerves—when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to
            bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then,
            straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed
            a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner which had the effect of
            discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him
            upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry,
            brimfull of the most ardent philosophy, and more than
            ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiments with rigor and with zeal.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon
            the spot, a profound incision into the tip of the subject’s
            nose, while the Doctor himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—
            was the effect electric. In the first place, the corpse
            opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in
            the fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner's face; in
            the fifth, turning to Messiurs Gliddon and Buckingham,
            it addressed them, in very capital Egyptian, thus:|
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised
            as I am mortified, at your behaviour. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He is a poor
            little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive
            him. But you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have
            travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine
         </p>
         <p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
            S 53
            
         </p>
         <p>you to the manor born—you, I say, who have been so
            much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I
            think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I
            have always been led to regard as the firm friend of
            the mummies—I really did anticipate more gentlemanly
            conduct from you. What am I to think of your standing
            quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used?
            What am I to suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick
            and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes,
            in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to
            come to the point) am I to regard your aiding and abct-;
            ting that miserable "little villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in
            pulling me by the nose ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances, we all either
            made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went
            off in a general swoon. One of these three things was,
            I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines
            of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued.
            And, upon my word, I am at a loss to know how or
            why it was that we pursued neither the one or the
            other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in
            the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of
            contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as
            the solution of everything in the way of paradox and
            impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the
            Mummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air
            that divested his words of the terrible. However this
            may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed
            to consider that any thing had gone very especially
            wrong.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>For my part I was convinced it was all right, and
            merely stepped aside, out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands into his 
            breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew 
            excessively red in the face. Mr. Gliddon stroked his 
            whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb into
            the left corner of his mouth.
         </p>
         <p>The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance
            for some minutes, and at length, with a sneer, said:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you
            hear what I asked you, or not? Do take your thumb out
            of your mouth!”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took
            his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth, and,
            by way of indemnification, inserted his left thumb in
            the right comer of the aperture above-mentioned.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure
            turned peevishly to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory
            tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics ; and
            but for the deficiency of American printing-offices in
            hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to
            record here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all
            the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took
            a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through
            the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company)—through the medium,

         <p></p>
         <p>I say, of Messiurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke the mother-tongue of the
            mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could
            not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modem, and, of course, entirely no-
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>vel to the stranger,) the two travelers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr. Gliddon, at
            one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon
            the wall, with a bit of charcoal, a little carbuncle-nosed
            gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with
            his left leg drawn back, his right arm thrown forward,
            with the fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p> and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees.
            Just in the same way Mr. Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modem idea, “wig,” until, (at Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion,) he grew very pale in the
            face, and consented to take off his own.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to
            science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance
             that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the
            individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding
            with a mere hint, (lor it could scarcely be considered
            more,) that, as these little matters were now explained,
            it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn;
            but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands
            with the company all round.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately
            busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our
            subject had sustained from the scalpel. We sewed up
            the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied
            a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It was now observed that the Count, (this was the title, it seems, of Allamistakeo,) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold. The doctor immediately
            repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black
            dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of skyblue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a
            walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patentleather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a
            pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the
            disparity of size between the Count and doctor, (the proportion being as two to one,) there was some little diffiin adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the
            Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have
            been said to be dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave
            him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the
            fire, while the doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course, expressed in regard to the somewhat
            remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s still remaining alive.
         </p>
         <p>“I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham,
            “ that it is high lime you were dead.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I
            am little more than seven hundred years old! My father
            lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage
            when he died.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly misjudged. It</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page254"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>had been five thousand and fifty years, and some months,
            since he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had
            no reference to your age at the period of interment; (I
            am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young
            man,) and my allusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must have been
            done up in asphaltum.”
         </p>
         <p>“In what ?” said the Count.
            “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.
            
         </p>
         <p>“Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean;
            it might be made to answer, no doubt,—but in my time
            we employed scarcely anything else than the Bichloride
            of Mercury.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“But what we are especially at a loss to understand,”
            said Doctor Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having
            been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago,
            you are here to-day all alive, and looking so delightfully
            well.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Had I been, as you say, dead," replied the Count, “it
            is more than probable that dead I should still be; for I
            perceive you are yet in the infancy of Galvanism, and
            cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing
            among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into
            catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that
            I was either dead or should be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of the
            chief principle of the embalming process?”
         </p>
         <p>“Why, not altogether.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“Ah, I perceive;—a deplorable condition of ignorance!
            Well, I cannot enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm, (properly speaking,)
            in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process. I use the word “animal”
            in its widest sense, as including the physical not more
            than the moral and vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalment consisted, with us, in the
            immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process.
            To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at
            the period of embalment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of
            the Scaraboeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at
            present.”
         </p>
         <p>“The blood of the Scaraboeus!” exclaimed Doctor
            Ponnonner.
            
         </p>
         <p>“Yes. The Scaraboeus was the insignium, or the
            “arras,” of a very distinguished and a very rare patrician
            family. To be “of the blood of the Scaraboeus,” is
            merely to be one of that family of which the Scaraboeus
            is the irsignium. I speak figuratively.”
         </p>
         <p>“But what has this to do with your being alive?”
            
         </p>
         <p>“Why it is the general custom, in Egypt, to deprive a
            corpse, before embalment, of its bowels and brains;
            the race of the Scaraboei alone did not coincide with the
            custom. Had I not been a Scaraboeus, therefore, I should
            have been without bowels and brains; and without either
            it is inconvenient to live.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“I perceive that;” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are
            of the race of Scaraboei.”
         </p>
         <p>“Beyond doubt.”
            “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon very meekly, “that the
            Scaraboeus was one of the Egyptian gods.”
            “One of the Egyptian what?” exclaimed the Mummy,
            starting to its feet.
            “Gods!” repeated the traveler.
            
         </p>
         <p>“Mr. Gliddon I really am ashamed to hear you talk in
            this style,” said the Count, resuming his chair. “No
            nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged
            more than one god. The Scaraboeus, the Ibis, etc., were
            with us, (as similar creatures have been with others)
            the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to a Creator too august to be more directly approached.”
         </p>
         <p>There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was
            renewed by Doctor Ponnonner.
            
         </p>
         <p>“It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that among the catacombs near the
            Nile, there may exist other mummies of the Scaraboeus
            tribe, in a condition of vitality.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“There can be no question of it,” replied the Count;
            all the Scaraboei embalmed accidentally while alive, are
            alive now. Even some of those purposely so embalmed,
            may have been overlooked by their executors, and still
            remain in the tombs.”
         </p>
         <p>“Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what
            you mean by ‘ purposely so embalmed?’”
            
         </p>
         <p>“With great pleasure,” answered the Mummy, after
            surveying me leisurely through his eye-glass—for it was
            the first time I had ventured to address him a direct
            question.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“With great pleasure,” said he. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my time, was about eight hundred
            years. Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer
            than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered
            the natural term. After the discovery of the embalming
            principle, as I have already described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity
            might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of
            science much advanced, by living this natural term in
            instalments. In the case of history, indeed, experience
            demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age
            of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and
            then get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause
            him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—
            say five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the
            expiration of this term, he would invariably find his
            great work converted into a species of hap-hazard notebook—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for the
            conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole
            herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc.,
            which passed under the name of annotations or emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to
            go about with a lantern to discover his own book. When
            discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search.
            After re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the
            bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work,
            immediately, in correcting from his own private
            knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived.
            Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages, from time to
            time, had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable."
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“I beg your pardon," said Doctor Ponnonner at this
            point, laying his hand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir,
            but may I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”
         </p>
         <p>“By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.
            "I merely wished to ask you a question," said the
            THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
            ?55
            
         </p>
         <p>Doctor. “ You mentioned the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch. Pray, sir,
            upon an average, what proportion of these Kabbala were
            usually found to be right ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were
            generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the
            facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves;
            —that is to say, not one individual iota of either, was
            ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally
            and radically wrong.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor,
            “that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your
            entombment, I take it for granted that your histories at
            that period, if not your traditions, were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only
            about ten centuries before.”
         </p>
         <p>“ Sir!” said Count Allamistakeo.
            
         </p>
         <p>The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only
            after much additional explanation, that the foreigner
            could be made to comprehend them. The latter at length
            said, hesitatingly:
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess,
            utterly novel. During my time i never knew any one to
            entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this
            world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all.
            I remember, once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin of the human race; and by this individual
            the very word Adam, (or Red Earth) which you make
            use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a
            generical sense,with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously
            upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of
            the globe.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a
            very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the siniciput of
            Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:—
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“The long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice of passing it, as you
            have explained, in instalments, must have had, indeed, a
            strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are
            to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians
            in all particulars of science, when compared with the
            moderns, and more especially with the Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“I confess again,” replied the Count with much suavity, “that I am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you;
            pray, to what particulars of science do you allude?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great
            length, the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of
            animal magnetism.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded 
            in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten,
            and that the manoeuvre? of Mesmer were really very
            contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban savans, who created lice and
            a great many other similar things.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He smiled rather contemptuously, and
            said they were.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This put me a little out, but I began to make other in quiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge, when a
            member of the company, who had never as yet opened
            his mouth, whispered in my ear that, for information on
            this head, I had better consult Ptolemy, (whoever Ptolemy is) as well as one Plutarch de facie lunoe.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses
            and lenses, and, in general, about the manufacture of
            glass; but I had not made an end of my queries before
            the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,
            and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus
            Siculus. As for the Count, he merely asked me, in the
            way of reply, if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of
            the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed
            himself in a very extraordinary way.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to
            the indignation of both the travelers, who pinched him
            black and blue to no purpose.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the BowlingGreen Fountain in New York ! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went on to
            detail very minutely the proportions of the fabric to which
            he referred. He explained that the portico alone was
            adorned with no less than four and twenty columns, five
            feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the precise dimensions of
            any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac,
            whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but
            the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of
            his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward
            of Thebes. He recollected, however, (talking of porticoes) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of
            suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and fortyfour columns, thirty-seven feet each in circumference, and
            twenty-five feet apart. The approach to this portico,
            from the Nile, was through an avenue two miles long,
            composed of sphynxes, statues and obelisks, twenty, sixty,
            and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well
            as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles
            long, and might have been, altogether, about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all oyer, within and
            without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to
            assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols
             might have been built within these walls, but he was by
            no means sure that two or three hundred of them might
            not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at Carnac was an insignificant little building after all.
            He, (the Count) however, could not conscientiously refuse
            to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of
             the Fountain at the Bowling-Green, as described by the
             Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever
             been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.
         </p>
         <p>I here asked the Count what he had to say to our rail-
            roads.
            
         </p>
         <p>“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were
            rather slight, rather ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of course, with the
            vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways, upon which
            the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks
            of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.
         </p>
         <p>I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.
            He agreed that we knew something in that way, but
            inquired how I should have gone to work in getting up
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page256"></div>
            the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at Car-
            nac.
            
         </p>
         <p>This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if
            he had any idea of Artesian wells; but he simply raised
            his eye-brows; while Mr. Gliddon, winked at me very
            hard, and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently
            discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water
            in the Great Oasis.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated
            his nose, and asked me if our steel could have executed 
            the sharp curved work seen on the obelisks, and which
            was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it ad.
            visable to vary the attack to Metaphysics. We sent for
            a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and read out of it a
            chapter or two about something which is not very clear,
            but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement or
            Progress.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The Count merely said that Great Movements were
            awfully common things in his day, and as for Progress
            it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of
            Democracy, and were at much trouble in impressing the
            Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in
            living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed
            not a little amused. When we had done, he said that, a
            great while ago, there had occurred something of a very
            similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all
            at once to be free, and so set a magnificent example to the 
            rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and 
            concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to 
            conceive. For a while they managed remarkably well;
            only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing
            ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states,
            with some fifteen or twenty others, into the most odious
            and insupportable despotism that ever was heard of upon
            the face of the Earth.
         </p>
         <p>I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.
            As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.
            Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and
            deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam.
            
         </p>
         <p>The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but
            made no answer. The silent gentleman, however, gave
            me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows—told me
            I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and demanded
            if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern
            steam engine is derived from the invention of Hero,
            through Solomon de Caus.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited;
            but, as good luck would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having
            rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people 
            of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in 
            the all-important particular of dress.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of
            his pantaloons, and then, taking hold of the end of
            one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some 
            minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended it- 
            self very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember
            that he said anything in the way of reply.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the mummy with great dignity, desired it to
            say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the manufacture
            of either Ponnonner’s lozenges, or Brandreth’s pills.
         </p>
         <p>We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer but
            
         </p>
         <p>in vain. It was not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed
            and hung down his head. Never was triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace. Indeed I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him
            stiffly, and took leave.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and
            went immediately to bed. It is now ten, A. M. I have
            been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the
            benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall
            behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am
            heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in
            general. I am convinced that everything is going wrong.
            Besides, I am anxious to know who will be President in
            2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup
            of coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years. EDGAR A. POE.

         <p>Autumn.
            In the dim woods, sadly sighing,
            Slowly, Summer lies a dying.
            Round the mother they are leaving
            Leaves, like children gather grieving.
            Piteously in knots, above her,
            Cold, and trembling violets hover.
            Hark! a chime of bells is tolling
            From the breeze’s belfry :—rolling
            |
            O'er the troubled tide of life,
            E’er the grave has hushed its strife.
            Every thing is now in keeping;
            Solemn trees are standing weeping.
            Soon, a snowy shroud will cover
            Her pale lily limbs all over.
            Like mourners in the open blast,
            Leaves in funeral trains go past.

            Alice Ray: a Romance in Rhyme. By Mrs. Sarah Jo-
            sepha Hale, Author of “Northwood" &amp;c. &amp;c. Phila-
            delphia.
            
         </p>
         <p>Mrs. Hale has been long distinguished as one of the
            purest and most vigorous writers in America—equally
            distinguished in poetry and in prose,
            “Alice Ray” will add much—very much—to her well earned reputation:—providing always the unpretending
             form in which it comes before the public, does not injure
             it in that most worldly public’s estimation, The volume,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p> simply printed and bound, is dedicated to “ The Lady
             Patronesses of the Fair Bazaar [Philadelphia] in aid of
             the Academy of Fine Arts"—and has Charity, of course,
            as its primary object.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The poem is truly beautiful. Its delicacy and fancy
             of conception, and the truthful simplicity and grace of
            its manner, have, we confess, quite taken us by surprise.
            We have read many of Mrs. Hale’s poetical compositions, but were prepared for nothing so good.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The story has a marked orsginality in it, and is well
            adapted to poetic effect—but the main excellence of the
            work lies in its point and force of expression—in the
            aggregate of its quotable passages. In place of an elaborate and needless criticism, we shall take the liberty
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page257"></div>
            of placing a few of these before our readers:—italici-
            zing what especially pleases us.
            The birds their love notes warble
            Among the blossom’d trees;
            The flowers are sighing forth their sweets
            To wooing honey bees;—
            The glad brook o’er a pebbly floor
            Goes dancing on its way,—
            But not a thing is so like spring
            As happy Alice Ray.
            And, with the Story-tellers,
            What friendships had she made!
            She pitied lonely Crusoe's lot,
            And lov'd Scheherazade,—
            But to the Bard of Avon turn’d
            Her fancy and her heart,
            Nor knew which most in him she lov'd—
            The nature or the art.
            Her world was ever joyous—
            
         </p>
         <p>She thought of grief and pain
            As giants in the olden time
            Thai ne’ er would come again.
         </p>
         <p>Her heart was like a fountain,
            The waters always sweet,—
            Her poney in the pasture,
            The kitten at her feet,
            The ruffling bird of Juno, and
            The men in the olden wall—
            Each knew her loving carefulness,
            And came at her soft call.
            He rode with grace and hearing high,
            Like Cossack in command:
            And his good steed would gently feed,
            Like Arab's, from his hand;
            And when he called his dog or steed;
            His tones were ever bland.
            The brave are ever gentle,
            The good should be the gay,—
            And Arthur was as bold of heart
            As knight in tourney fray,—
            His mind was always firm for truth
            As rock ’mid ocean’s spray;
            And though a restless daring will
            At times he might display,
            His wildest moods were calmed at once,
            But mention Alice Ray.
            And she—though when you talked of him
            She blushed and turned away—
            Was still his partner in the dance
            And in the dashing sleigh—
            — They always searched together
            For flowers the first of May;
            And duly to the Sabbath School
            On every holy day
            She went—they both were Teachers there—
            She went with Arthur dray.
            However dear new friends may be,
            However far she stray,
            8he yet will see her Mother weep,
            And hear her Father pray,—
            Praying for her happiness,
            Weeping in dismay,
            That she, their dear and only child
            Must go so far away I—
            —She bade farewell to them and all—
            Farewell to Arthur Gray.
            It will be seen that the two passages last quoted hare
            the peculiarity of a constantly recurring rhyme in ay.—
            
         </p>
         <p>The four cantos of the poem are terminated with some
            twenty or thirty lines in this manner—with the identical
            rhyme in ay—and the idea is not only original, but the
            effect (and not merely the musical effect) is one of the
            very happiest we have known in poetical art. Throughout is manifested an exquisite sense of the forcible and
            of the delicate, in rhythm. Upon the whole, this poem
            cannot fail to elevate its author very highly in the opinion of all those whose opinion she would be likely to
            value.

            of Benevenuto Cellini, a Florentine Artist; written by
            Himself. Containing a Variety of Information respecting the Arts and the History of the Sixteenth Century. With the Notes and Observations of G. P. Carpani. Translated by Thomas Roscoe, Esq. Vol. 1.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>All men of letters agree that the Autobiography of
            Cellini is one of the most interesting books ever written.
            It could not fail to be so—Cellini having been what he
            was, and having seen what he saw. He was intimate
            with all the noted men of his very remarkable age,
            and was perpetually occupied either in great or in petty
            intrigue, lie felt keenly—in fact his excessive sensibility
            amounted to madness—and he has depicted his feelings,
            not less than his thoughts and deeds, with the hand of a
            profound moral painter. Horace Walpole has done, indeed, but feeble justice to these Memoirs, in calling them
            “more amusing than any novel” he knew. They are,
            perhaps, more instructive than any single history, of the
            same volume, in existence.

         <p>Last week we announced the issue of these volumes.
            They are of very unusual Interest—presenting the first
            English translation of the complete work of Manzoni––
            
         </p>
         <p>one of the most noted and best Italian fictions. It is not
            a novel, in the common acceptation of the term, but a
            moral and religious essay, enlivened into a rich interest
            by picturesque description and exciting incident.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The amount of matter afforded, for half a dollar, in
            each number of this series, is almost marvellous, in view
            of the excellent paper and printing. These two Volumes

            in the “Province of New-York.” Mrs. Grant—who is

         <p>speaks of the Work as an account of “the rapid pace
            with which an infant society has urged on its progress

         <p></p>
         <p>The character of Alfieri, with more of passion and more
            of fierté, resembled very remarkably that of Benevenuto
            Cellini. His impulsiveness not less than his genius
            made him what he was—a great man. His “mission”
            (to use a cant term) seemed to be reform—and few more
            comprehensive or effective reformers ever lived. We
            look on his Autobiography as one of the most vivid books
            in existence—intensely interesting. In the volume now
            before us, we find it prefaced by a fine Essay on his Genius
            and Times, by Mr. Lester. The translation is from the
            Lucca edition of 1814, and seems to uS particularly well
            done.

            “Walter Von Der Vogelweide” is an artistic composition
            of high merit, rhetorically considered. The editorial
            criticisms are excellent.

            Mrs. Hale, Miss Leslie, Fanny Forrester, Mrs. Hentz,

            The third (a fashion design) is the extreme of the absurd.
            The contributions are, in general, from good names—Mrs.
            Ellet, Mrs. Child, Mrs. Osgood, Mrs. Sigourney, Mrs.
            Kirkland, Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Browne, F. E. F., Morris, Inman, and others—a particularly strong list. “The Maiden’s Leap” by Mrs. Ellet, is in her best manner. Her style
            is noted for accuracy, purity, and freedom from superfluity. She is one of the most accomplished of our countrywomen.

            How purely the Pleiades sparkle in heaven,
            And shed their sweet influence over the earth!
            And one seems the fairest to me of the seven,
            Under which, Helen, yon and I had our birth.
            Oh, ours was a beautiful, blossoming time,
            'Mid the blush of young roses, the earliest here;
            On us fell the purple of Spring in its prime,
            And to Maia, our mother, our childhood was dear.
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page259"></div>
            The roses which crimsoned our cradles still charm me;
            And night now ha3 nothing I love like that star—
            But has Fate never once tried in boyhood to harm me?
            Are the roses of feeling unruffled 1 Thine are—
            For care could not come, dear, thy heart’s bloom to blight,
            So young and so lovely, so tender and true;
            Still, still is thy summer-sky laughing with light—
            Ah me! were my own as immaculate too I
            Why choose you yon large planet, rounded and bright,
            And call it your own, your particular star!
            Though scarcely as large as its least satellite,
            Should the twinkle of Maia be welcomer far.
            Like a cloudlet of light shines that sweet little cluster,
            Wherein is our natal sphere radiantly shrined:
            We will dream, as together we gaze on its lustre,
            Of a spring-time perennial our spirits shall find!

         <p>The subjoined comments on Mr. Murdoch were furnished us by a friend whose judgment we respect. The first
            three paragraphs were intended for last week’s Journal,
            but accidentally omitted—the dates, of course, refer to
            last week. With the opinions expressed we nearly, but
            not altogether, agree. What we ourselves think of Mr.
            Murdoch, we shall take occasion to say, somewhat in detail, hereafter.—Ed. B. J.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Murdoch’s Reception.—Mr. Murdoch made good
            our augury by presenting to the most watchful audience
            of the season, at the Park Theatre, on Tuesday evening,
            the best Hamlet on the continent. No actor, on his first
            appearance, was ever so closely followed; and it was
            only great skill wisely employed that gained for him a
            triumph at the end. It was clearly his determination
            from the first, by no act nor look, to overstep the modesty
            of nature. The same discretion and power, employed on
            a more telling part, would have secured to him a house
            stormy with applause. But it was his cue to enter on
            his great career as an actor modestly, to begin at the fine
            end of the wedge, and to drive it home firmly thereafter,
            in parts of force, and passion, and louder emphasis. It
            was a critical undertaking, and to have brought himself
            off with credit, would have been much; to have made
            an “impression,” and to have gained for himself by this
            single performance a right to engage in personations of
            the highest range, was a triumph indeed. Our good hope
            of Mr. Murdoch is sustained, and more than sustained.—
            With this verdict of approval, the well-earned favor of
            an audience vigilant and hard to please, and lately over
            tasked with Hamlet, (for it was up twice in the just previous engagement of Mr. Charles Kean,) he will go
            abroad, sure of a triumphant reception in all quarters of
            the country. We are proud that another of our young
            countrymen has planted his foot on the stage, there to
            stand in honor and increasing power, for a long day, we
            hope, of active skill and popular favor.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If we can but persuade our countrymen to look at it
            aright, this is a memorable event. Every native man
            put upon the stage, with character and judgment, and
            true power to bear him up, is a ground and pillar on
            which to build a drama of our own. It was to this we
            referred in introducing Mr. Murdoch to our readers at
            first; and it is to this, we believe, he will be true to the
            last. We do not enter upon a critical examination of his
            Hamlet, further than to say, that it was the most perfect
            commentary on the written play we have ever had presen-
         </p>
         <p>ted to us. It was plain and easy reading throughout.
            The embodiment was perfect.
            
         </p>
         <p>It is not to be said of Mr. Murdoch that he has a fine
            conception of his author, but that his voice failed him ;
            or that his voice was musically true to the sentiment,
            but that his person lacked something of the scholar and
            the man of graceful mien. He had them all together:
            voice, person, mien, and insight. And this, we will undertake to say, can be asserted of no Hamlet with which
            American audiences have been recently familiar. Mr.
            Murdoch’s Hamletis but the first round on the ladder. We
            are safe in asserting, that each new personation will
            carry him higher in his art, and lift him to a point where
            he will fix upon himself more and more of the popular
            regard.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Murdoch followed up his success in Hamlet with
            an Othello on Thursday evening still more decisive. Our
            contemporaries have all acknowledged the great excellence of this personation, and we are not disposed to dispute it. The fifth act, particularly, impressed us as it
            has everybody else, as a masterpiece. It was one of the
            complete, finished and satisfactory achievements which
            hang in the mind like a choice painting, apart by themselves, never to be outdone or superseded. Throughout
            the whole play there were constant indications of the
            fine spirit which possesses Mr. Murdoch, and at times
            flashes of fire and passion which carried the audience as
            by storm.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>To these admirable performances Mr. Murdoch added
            his Benedick on Monday, which is acknowledged on all
            hands to be the best, taken all in all, which the NewYork stage has known for many and many a year. Perfect grace and beauty and spirit marked it ail through.
            The challenge and the parting with the prince; the wooing of Beatrice, and the closing scenes, were the perfection of gentlemanly bearing—the chivalry of a true souled
            lover, and the best.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Wearing these laurels as his vouchers of merit, this
            young American actor must be received in all parts of
            the country with acclamation. He has acquired suddenly (but as the fruit of long previous and assiduous training) a great renown; and he will add to it, we are safe
            in declaring, every day of his life. The early day at
            which we go to press will not allow us to speak of his
            Claude Melnotte (Wednesday evening) nor his Macbeth
            (of Friday); but of these and of his parting reception at
            the houses of New-York,we shall have something to say
            in our next paper.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We have before us a letter from Miss Eliza Cook, in
            which she says “I need not tell you how much I admire and estimate your bright countrywoman, Miss Cushman. We are friends, and, I trust, will long be such.—
            She is gathering golden opinions from the English, and
            will take a high standing in her profession.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The well-known company of rats at the Park Theatre, understand, it is said, their cue perfectly. It is worth
            the price of admission to see their performance. By long
            training they know precisely the time when the curtain
            rises, and the exact degree in which the audience is spellbound by what is going on. At the sound of the bell
            they sally out; scouring the pit for chance peanuts and
            orange-peel. When, by the rhyming couplets, they are
            made aware that the curtain is about to fall, they disappear—through respect for the moving heels of the audience. Their temerity is regulated by the intensity of
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page260"></div>
            the performers. A profitable engagement might be made,
            we think, with “the celebrated Dog Billy.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“Cruikshank’s Table-Book” has a pleasant paper, setting forth some of the secrets of ‘ advertising patronage’
            and the use that may be made of orders to the theatre,
            (a privilege of the London press not adopted here,) in
            fomenting the same. Hanker Grabb calls himself Editor,
            and admits a limited circulation and that “ to the offices
            of such newspapers trades-people do not come rushing,
            frantically tendering their five and sixpences for the insertion of their announcements.” And he feelingly remarks, “In these days a fresco painting is the only thing
            that can stand without a canvass.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>His advice is this: “On Wednesday morning—it is
            useless to begin earlier—pocket as many tickets as the
            managers will let you write—and go round your advertising connection. Some editors are silly enough to
            think that this is not a gentleman’s vocation—who says
            it is? The question is not about gentlemanliness, but
            about advertisements. If you want these, go for them—
            if not, send your clerks. Go into the shops and see the
            principals. Say something of this kind, “Ah! Choppings, how are you?” (Your friend is e. g. a sausagemaker.) “Coining money, as usual? Oh! don’t tell
            me—I’m coming to borrow a few thousands of you one
            of these days. I say, old fellow, you have n’t given us a
            turn lately. Oh, nonsense! can’t afford it. You can afford anything. What! advertising don’t bring returns?
            Stuff! I pledge you my sacred honor, that one of the
            Queen’s tradesmen came to me yesterday, swearing he
            had made ninety-four pounds by one advertisement only.
            Come, give us a ‘repeat’ of that about the Royal Albert Brawn and Pettitoes. No? Yes, you will. “Oh!
            by the way, would n’t you like to go to the theatre?—
            Any you like. Here’s the  'Garden,’ and the ‘Wells’—
            have ’em both—take Mrs. Choppings—how is she? Here
            —I’m always happy to oblige you; and now, good-bye—
            I shall insert the Royal Albert’s. Good-bye.”

            Drearily, drearily falls the rain
            On the grave where the loved doth rest,
            And the cold, damp earth lies heavily
            Upon her snowy breast;
            Before the breeze,
            The swaying trees
            Nod like a funeral plume,
            And seem to moan,
            With a dismal groan,
            Though our gentle maiden to Heaven hath flown
            From this earth of sorrow and gloom.
            In her life she loved those grand old trees,
            That are now bewailing her death,
            And would list as the wildly-wandering breeze
            Swept by with musical breath,
            To the manifold tones of joy and fear,
            That those wind-harps gave to her charmed ear.
            With sparkling eyes and flushing cheek
            Her heart would then its fulness speak;
            And seizing her lyre, high strains would ring
            With harmonious chime from each quivering string—
            Such strains as, in Heaven, bright seraphs sing.
            By the side of this woodland brook, which now
            Is filled by the dead, brown leaves,
            She hath rambled often, what time the moon
            Her orient chamber leaves;
            
         </p>
         <p>And the silvery light, as it shimmered down
            Through the trees, seemed to rest like a radiant crown
            Upon her forehead, so white and fair,
         </p>
         <p>And the waving curls of her dark brown hair;
            But the brook, nor the trees,
            Nor the whispering breeze,
            Could her feverish, tameless soul appease!
            Now the wearying strife of her earthly life
            Hath come to a final close;
            She is gone where sorrow will never more
            Disturb her soul’s repose;
            Her heart was crushed,
            And her lyre is hushed,
            
         </p>
         <p>No more will its sad, low strain
            Re-echo music from out a soul
            Filled up with bitter pain—

         <p>But its joyful tones we shall hear once more,

         <p>La Sortie du Bain.—In New York there has been
            some variety of opinion in respect to this work of De
            Kuyper—and, we think, some very unjustifiable abuse ol
            it. Neither its merits nor its defects have been fairly
            treated. 'I he former are great—the latter few and comparatively trivial. The figure—of white marble, slightly
            impaired by blue veins—is the size of life, and represents
            a young and exquisitely beautiful woman, reclining on the
            sea-shore, somewhat in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator—although, of course, with more of repose. The name
            given the sculpture—La Sortie du Bain—and the shellstrown shore on which we see the girl—denotes that she
            has lately emerged from the sea, in which she has been
            bathing. She has thrown herself listlessly on the sand,
            and is engaged in attempting to feed a tortoise with a

         <p>The face is of surpassing loveliness—its expression that
            of girlish innocence, and the languor consequent from
            bathing. The attitude is easy, and full of truth. The
            toes, in especial, convey the idea of one luxuriating in
            the sense of comfort—of refreshment—of animal life and
            health. As a mere composition, the limes of the whole
            figure are well arranged. Its anatomy is by no meant
            faultless. The head, neck, and bust are perfect; the
            arms, hands, and feet could not be improved. The lower
            limbs are, also, admirably carved—but the breadth of the
            hips is insufficient; they are not broader than the shoulders—and these latter have an unpleasant roundness
            which is not justified even by the stooping position. The
            shoulder-blades, too, have no variation, and yet the figure
            leans much of its weight upon its left arm, which reposes
            upon some accessory sculpture of no very definite meaning, and certainly quite out of keeping with the general
            design. The neat and ornate braiding of the hair, too, is
            not only out of keeping, but stiff.

         <p>Leopold de Meyer made his fourth appearance on
            Tuesday last, before a highly delighted audience. So
            much has already been said about this tyrant of the
            Pianoforte, that little is left to us. We call him tyrant;
            are we right or wrong?, We really pity the poor Piano
            when, trembling beneath the load of heavy harmony, it
            sends its plaintive melodies to the audience, but then
            again, when released from the grasp of the demon, it
            sends forth its warblings and shakes, it makes our heart
            dance with delight, and quite an effort is necessary to
            prevent our running on the stage and embracing the artist. De Meyer has been compared to Thalberg, Listz
            and others, but his style bears not the slightest resemblance to that of either. He certainly has the delicacy of Thalberg in his brilliant passages, and the power
            and energy of Liszt in his chords and arpeggios, but then
            his genius combines them so successfully, that efforts of
            the most novel and striking character are produced. As
            a composer, Mr. De Meyer enjoys quite a high reputation; we really do not know which to admire most; the
            style of his playing, or the beauty of his compositions.
            We understand that Scharfenberg and Louis have published the Marche Marocaine, as played by him in his
            concerts.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We copy from “The Brooklyn Star," the following
            very just parallel between the manner of Thalberg and
            that of De Meyer.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>While the musical world Is in raptures with Leopold de Meyer,
            it will not be deemed out of place to make a few suggestions of
            comparison between him and Thalberg.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Thalberg has been the favorite of the continent, and long since
            made his fortune. He makes of the piano forte the sweet and delicate instrument it was designed to be. He enters the soul by gentle whispers of melody, and then subdues and dissolves it by the
            most entrancing and captivating harmony. His style is the antipodes of De Meyers. He seats himself at the instrument—he looks
            contemplatively round at his audience—he then throws his fingers
            over the keys, and the gentlest warbling of the Æolian harp are
            heard; the tones gradually increase till the soul is exalted by the
            moat exquisite combinations, and the utmost sublimity and delicacy
            of expression.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>De Meyer on the contrary, pounces upon the piano like an enraged tiger. He brings a physical force to bear upon it which
            would kill Thalberg in a night. No ordinary instrument could
            withstand his usage, and pianos of uncommon strength are constructed for bis use. His object seems to be, to produce a hurricane
            of melody; and, as the spirit of the storm, he dashes onward, his
            frame doubled and his fingers plying till the perspiration streams
            from his face, and he seems to end his musical agony like a tragic
            actor in a death scene. As be whirls along he occasionally glares
            upon his auditors with a kind of insane stare, which shows the intensity of his concentration upon the wild music with which he
            weaves his spells.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>De Meyer may produce more extraordinary effect, but Thalberg
            renders the instrument more productive of those delicate charms
            which the natural sense of music can feel and appreciate.

         <p>Editorial Miscellany.
            We take the following paragraph from "The Sunday
            Times and Messenger” of October 26:
            
         </p>
         <p>Ma. Poe’s Poem.—Mr. Poe was invited to deliver a poem before the Boston Lyceum, which he did to a large and distinguished
            audience. It was, to use the language of an intelligent hearer,
             "an elegant and classic production, based on the right principle;
            containing the essence of true poetry, mingled with a gorgeous imagination, exquisite painting, every charm of metre, and graceful
            delivery.” And yet the papers abused him, and the audience were
            fidgetty—made their exit one by one, and did not at all appreciate
            the efforts of a man of admitted ability, whom they had invited to
            deliver a poem before them. The poem was called the “Messenger Star.” We presume Mr. Poe will not accept another invitation to recite poetry, original or selected, in that section of the
            Union.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Our excellent friend Major Noah has suffered himself
            to be cajoled by that most beguiling of all beguiling little divinities. Miss Walters, of “The Transcript.” We
            have been looking all over her article, with the aid of a
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page262"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>taper, to see if we could discover a single syllable of
            truth in it—and really blush to acknowledge that we cannot. The adorable creature has been telling a parcel of
            fibs about us, by way of revenge for something that we
            did to Mr. Longfellow (who admires her very much) and
            for calling her “a pretty little witch” into the bargain.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The facts of the case seem to be these:—We were invited to “deliver” (stand and deliver) a poem before the
            Boston Lyceum. As a matter of course, we accepted the
            invitation. The audience was “large and distinguished.”
            Mr. Cushing preceded us with a very capital discourse:
            he was much applauded. On arising, we were most cordially received. We occupied some fifteen minutes with
            an apology for not “delivering,” as is usual in such cases, a didactic poem: a didactic poem, in our opinion,
            being precisely no poem at all. After some farther words
            —still of apology—for the “indefinitiveness” and “general imbecility” of what we had to offer—all so unworthy
            a Bostonian audience—we commenced, and, with many interruptions of applause, concluded. Upon the whole
            the approbation was considerably more (the more the pity
            too) than that bestowed upon Mr. Cushing.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>When we had made an end, the audience, of course,
            arose to depart—and about one-tenth of them, probably,
            had really departed, when Mr. Coffin, one of the managing committee, arrested those who remained, by the announcement that we had been requested to deliver “The
            Raven.” We delivered “The Raven” forthwith—(without
            taking a receipt)—were very cordially applauded again—
            and this was the end of it—with the exception of the sad
            tale invented to suit her own purposes, by that amiable
            little enemy of ours, Miss Walters. We shall never call
            a woman “a pretty little witch” again, as long as we
            live.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We like Boston. We were bom there—and perhaps it
            is just as well not to mention that we are heartily ashamed of the fact. The Bostonians are very well in their
            way. Their hotels are bad. Their pumpkin pies are delicious. Their poetry is not so good. Their common is
            no common thing—and the duck-pond might answer—
            if its answer could be heard for the frogs.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>But with all these good qualities the Bostonians have
            no soul. They have always evinced towards us individually, the basest ingratitude for the services we rendered
            them in enlightening them about the originality of Mr.
            Longfellow. When we accepted, therefore, an invitation
            to “deliver” a poem in Boston—we accepted it simply
            and solely, because we had a curiosity to know how it
            felt to be publicly hissed—and because we wished to see
            what effect we could produce by a neat little impromptu
            speech in reply. Perhaps, however, we overrated our
            own importance, or the Bostonian want of common civility—which is not quite so manifest as one or two of their
            editors would wish the public to believe. We assure
            Major Noah that he is wrong. The Bostonians are wellbred—as very dull persons very generally are.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Still, with their vile ingratitude staring us in the eyes,
            it could scarcely be supposed that we would put ourselves
            to the trouble of composing for the Bostonians anything
            in the shape of an original poem. We did not. We had
            a poem (of about 500 lines) lying by us—one quite as
            good as new—one, at all events, that we considered would
            answer sufficiently well for an audience of Transcendentalists. That we gave them—it was the best that we
            had—for the price—and it did answer remarkably well.
            Its name was not “The Messenger-Star”—who but Miss
            Walters would ever think of so delicious a little bit of
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p> invention as that? We had no name for it at all. The
             poem is what is occasionally called a “juvenile poem”—
            but the fact is, it is anything but juvenile now, for we
            wrote it, printed it, and published it, in book form, before
            we had fairly completed our tenth year. We read it verbatim, from a copy now in our possession, and which we
            shall he happy to show at any moment to any of our inquisitive friends.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We do not, ourselves, think the poem a remarkably
             good one —it is not sufficiently transcendental. Still it
            did well enough for the Boston audience—who evinced
            characteristic discrimination in understanding, and especially applauding, all those knotty passages which we
            ourselves have not yet been able to understand.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As regards the anger of the “Boston Times” and one
            or two other absurdities—as regards, we say, the wrath of
            Achilles—we incurred it—or rather its manifestation—
            by letting some of our cat out of the bag a few hours
            sooner than we had intended. Over a bottle of champagne, that night, we confessed to Mess. Cushing, Whipple, Hudson, Field, and a few other natives who swear
            not altogether by the frog-pond—we confessed, we say,
            the soft impeachment of the hoax. Et hinc iliae irae.
            We should have waited a couple of days.
         </p>
         <p>The Concordia (La.) Intelligencer” says:
            
         </p>
         <p>By the bye, here is a touch from the pen of Poe the poet—editor of the Broadway Journal. A Niagara lick like this beats Mississippi all to Jits.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Resolved, That the steamer Niagara will be as distinguished in
            the waters of the East, as the great cataract whose name she bears
            is among the wafers of the West.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We are sadly puzzled to understand what all this is
            about. One thing is certain:—we never made a “resolution” in our lives. Should we ever make one, we hope
            it will be in better taste than the one above.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It has been roundly asserted, of late, that “the slashing article in the Foreign Quarterly upon American poets
            which so much excited the ire of the newspapers,” is ascertained, at last, to be the work of Sir John Bell.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We happen to know better. It was written by nobody
            in the world but Charles Dickens—and a very discriminating article it was;—that is to say, discriminating so
            far as the actual information of its author extended in regard to our poetical affairs.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We are in a fair way, at last, to obtain some accurate
            knowledge of Chinese history and geography. Among
            other works lately published we notice, besides Marco
            Polos’s Travels, a “Scientific Voyage into Altay and Adjacent Countries on the Chinese Frontier”—also “Memoirs of Father Ripa, during Thirteen Years’ Residence
            at the Court of Pekin, &amp;c. Selected and Translated from
            the Italian, by Fortunato Prandi." Some Essays by Professor Neumann who has just returned from Persia, demonstrate that the Chinese, from time immemorial, have
            traded to Oregon and California.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The British Critic in a rather weak, although sufficiently complimentary review of “Tales by Edgar A.
            Poe,” says, among other things—“The author seems to
            have amused himself by tracing a series of references between every minute act, and so upward to the making
            and dethroning of kings [downward would have done better]. He has been as assiduous in this scheme as an Indian who follows the trail of a foe. He has learned from
            the dwellers in the American woods a marked acuteness
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page263"></div>
            which he has dealed out again to us, in the Tales before
            us.”
            
         </p>
         <p>The only objection to this theory is that we never go
            into the woods (for fear of the owls) and are quite sure
            that we never saw a live Indian in our lives.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In the hurry of getting to press last week, there occurred one or two vexatious errata—the worst of which,
            perhaps, was the omission of a notice (prepared us by a
            friend) of Mr. Murdoch’s Hamlet. The Greek verb which
            formed the motto of “The Thread-Bare,” was lamentably jumbled up. In the exquisite poem entitled “Sybil”
            (from the pen of William Gibson, U. S. N.) the word
            “raised” at the cíose of the third line, being printed
            “raises”, made nonsense of the whole sentence. From
            the fine ballad headed “Isadore”, the signature of A. M.
            Ide, Jr. was, also, accidentally omitted; and that of W.
            G. Simms should have been appended to the “Sonnet by
            the Poor Debtor.” These errors, however, are attributable to ourselves alone.

         <p>We have been glancing at an article on the Reading
            Room of the British Museum. The deductions are, of
            course, the munificence and courtesy of the English
            government to strangers. There is one place at least 
            where the scholar visiting London from a foreign country
            is at home—the British Museum. He sits at the table 
            and may command the books—the Royal collections and 
            all, familiarly as he would bid his own child take down
            for him the esteemed volume from the single shelf at
            home. Here he has his privileges and dignities, a place
            of labor where he may “break the neck of the day” as
            Sir Walter used to say, over a favorite folio, and sally out
            among the multitudes of London with the pleasing consciousness of at least some work respectably done. Let
            no man undervalue this who has not felt the solitude of
            London, the monotony of the streets and the want of
            those out-of-door sympathies so freely shared in Paris.

         <p>Some of the annoyances of the Reading Room are odd—
            the incursions for instance of the students of the University College. “Perhaps,” says the writer “it were too
            much to expect that each young Collegian should be at
            the expense of purchasing a Schrevelius’ Lexicon and using it at home.” Assuredly;—there were flies, it is to be
            presumed, in Paradise.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Another grievance is to be “fogged out” by a moist
            November day—the provisions of the Institution allowing
            no lights.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>When shall we have a permanent Library in New
            York?—not a Circulating Library, with the volume which
            you want somewhere, probably, between finger and
            thumb in Westchester county, but a library confined to the
            premises, with a perpetual writ of ne exeat, included in
            the charter, against all volumes leaving the front door,
            It is not necessary that the library should be so large as
            many of the century accumulations of Europe. Fifty
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>thousand volumes on the spot would be sufficient—gathered together scientifically, in the first instance, with
            proportion and completeness for the departments. Pens,
            ink and paper, wide chairs and wide tables, should be added; attendants for convenience and care of the books; and
            some formality to check mere literary loafers and all Collegians in round-a-bout jackets.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If we were autocrat for a week we should convert the
            Society Library buildings (after exorcising the tailors,)
            into just such an establishment; and we believe the Librarian and a majority of the members would be in favor
            of the change.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>A complete establishment of book pirnting has been recently discovered and broken up in the French provinces.
            Upwards of 18,000 volumes were found hidden away between the inner and outer walls—the works of La Martine and Thiers’ “Consulate and Empire,” among the
            number.

         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Hudson, in his Shakspeare Lectures here, last
            winter, had the misfortune to put people unaccustomed
            to the operation, to the trouble of thinking—an annoyance which a certain class never forgets. There were,
            in his style, terseness and strength—a rude vigor. All
            conventionalism, pretence and affectation shrivelled in
            his grasp—witness his character of Jacques, in As You
            Like It, whom he made the type of the selfish, vain
            spectators in the world, men of large head and little
            heart who are superior in virtue to the men of action and
            purpose—only because they do nothing. The rigid,
            resolute manner of the lecturer was the index of the
            strength of his convictions. Perhaps his audiences were
            too limited to the cultivated class of readers and thinkers, for him to enjoy the highest triumphs. An assembly
            of all who attend the representation of Shakspeare at the
            Bowery, the Chatham and the Park, would have been
            impressed by his keen sarcasm upon successful evil and
            eloquent defence of persecuted virtue. He had that respect for the people that he would not shrink from telling them what their faint-hearted, hypocritical admirers
            call an unpopular truth. Mr. Hudson at the close of his
            lectures last winter, looked round upon his faithful audience who had kept him company through his whole
            course, thanked them for their kindness and attention,
            public and private, and remarked that he had not yet succeeded in New-York, but that he would return and
            succeed yet. There was a true democracy in this—a
            frank honesty which set aside mere cultivation and scholarship and social privileges, for an appeal to the heart
            of the public—that public to which he brought no letters,
            who would come to hear him for the sake of his subject, and not merely to keep up the appearance of a literary coterie. Mr. Hudson felt this, and had magnanimity enough to acknowledge it—and an appeal to this public was, we presume, what he meant when he said he
            would yet succeed in New-York.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We have not heard whether Mr. Hudson has made any
            arrangements to lecture in this city. Why should he not
            take Palmo’s for a few nights and fill it as profitably as
            Mr. Templeton, or an interlude on the boards of the
            theatre itself, as well as De Meyer’s piano? At any
            rate, he must come and give a New-York audience an
            opportunity of hearing his two new lectures on Lear
            and Othello, the composition of which, it is understood,

            J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
            MANUFACTURER OF THE
            IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
            By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
            JP. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established
            himself for the manufacture
            • and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
            281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
            His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices,
            thereby saving purchasers the high duties
            imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
            
         </p>
         <p>J. P. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles,
            with all the modem improvements of
            London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness
            of mechanism. Particular care is taken
            to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will
            be found far superior to any of European manufacture, imported in the usual way.
         </p>
         <p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in
            Europe; among the latter, he would mention
            N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.
            J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional taken! in
            this country.
            
         </p>
         <p>Mr. J. P. Browne, Sir:—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making
            a professional use of your Harps, and of
            testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone,
            workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
            against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the
            most entire satisfaction.
         </p>
         <p>January, 1845.	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
            
         </p>
         <p>Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your
            Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city.—
            The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I
            have heard for many years. I remember my old
            Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no
            other. Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.
            Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. J. P. Browne, Sir:—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Han) of your make
            f performed on at the St. George’s Society
            Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest
            I ever played on. This will apply to all yonr Harps.
            The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours,
            with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
            New York, January 16th, 1845.	a pupil of N. C. Boscha.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. J. P. Browne, Sid Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action
            Harps, I find they possess the best qualities of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the
            most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
            ease of modulation, they arc superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior
            must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
            Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced
            in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure
            in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.
