         <p>Of my country and of my family I have little to say.
            Ill usage and length of years have driven me from the
            one, and estranged me from the other. Hereditary wealth
            afforded me an education of no common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the
            stores which early study very diligently garnered up.—
            Beyond all things, the works of the German moralists
            gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with
            which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect
            their falsities. I have often been reproached with the
            aridity of my genius; a deficiency of imagination has
            been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism of
            my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear,
            tinctured my mind with a very common error of this
            age—I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the
            east susceptible of such reference, to the principles of
            that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less
            liable than myself to be led away from the severe preeincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I have
            bought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible
            tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving
            of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of
            a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead
            tetter and a nullity.
         </p>
         
         <p>After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in
            the year 18—, from the port of Batavia, in the rich and
            Populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago 
            of the Sunda islands. I went as passenger—having no
            other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness
            which haunted me as a fiend.
         </p>
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         <p>Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred
            tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar
            teak. She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from
            the Lachadive islands. We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The
            stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently
            crank.
         </p>
         
         <p>We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and
            for many days stood along the eastern coast of Java,
            without any other incident to beguile the monotony of
            our course than the occasional meeting with some of the
            small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.
         </p>
         
         <p>One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a
            very singular, isolated cloud, to the N. W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first
            we had seen since our departure from Batavia. I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once
            to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon
            with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long
            line of low beach. My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and
            the peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than
            usually transparent. Although I could distinctly see the
            bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen
            fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was
            loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising
            from heated iron. As night came on, every breath of
            wind died away, and a more entire calm it is impossible
            to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon' the
            poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long
            hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without
            the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the
            captain said he could perceive no indication of danger,
            and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered
            the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch
            was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays,
            stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. I went below—not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed,
            every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to
            give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me
            from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.—
            As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise,
            like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a millwheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found
            the ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a
            wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and,
            rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from
            stem to stern.
         </p>
         
         <p>The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation of the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by the board, she
            rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, stagger
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page204"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            ing awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest,
            finally righted.
         </p>
         
         <p>By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible
            to say. Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post
            and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my feet, and
            looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea
            of our being among breakers ; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and
            foaming ocean within which we were engulfed. After a
            while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came
            reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the sole
            survivors of the accident. All on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard;—the captain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the
            cabins were deluged with water. Without assistance,
            we could expect to do little for the security of the ship,
            and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course,
            parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea,
            and the water made clear breaches over us. The framework of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury;
            but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked,
            and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast.—
            The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and
            we apprehended little danger from the violence of the
            wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with
            dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition,
            we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell
            which would ensue. But this very just apprehension
            seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. For five
            entire days and nights—during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with
            great difficulty from the forecastle—the hulk flew at a
            rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws
            of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of
            the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I
            had before encountered. Our course for the first four
            days was, with trifling variations, S. E. and by S.; and
            we must have run down the coast of New Holland.—
            On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the
            wind had hauled round a point more to the northward.—
            The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered
            a very few degrees above the horizon—emitting no decisive light. There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind
            was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could guess,
            our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the
            sun. It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull
            and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were
            polarized. Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its
            central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,
            silver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable
            ocean.
         </p>
         
         <p>We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day—
            that day to me has not arrived—to the Swede, never did
            arrive. Thenceforward we were enshrouded in pitchy
            darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at
            twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to
            envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics. We
            observed too, that, although the tempest continued to 
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be
            discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which
            had hitherto attended us. All around were horror, and
            thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony.—
            Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the
            old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent
            wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse
            than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible,
            to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into
            the world of ocean. We had no means of calculating
            time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We
            were, however, well aware of having made farther to
            the southward than any previous navigators, and felt
            great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last—every mountainous billow hurried to
            overwhelm us. The swell surpassed anything I had
            imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried
            is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of
            our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of
            our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that
            death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an
            hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the
            swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an
            elevation beyond the albatross—at times became dizzy
            with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell,
            where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the
            slumbers of the kraken.
         </p>
         
         <p>We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when
            a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon
            the night. “See!” see!” cried he, shrieking in my
            ears, “Almighty God! see! see!” As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which
            streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we
            lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting
            my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the
            current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above
            us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent,
            hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand tons.
            Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more
            than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent
            size still exceeded that of any ship of the line or East
            Indiaman in existence. Her huge hull was of a deep
            dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings
            of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from
            her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces
            the fires of innumerable battle-lanterus, which swung to
            and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us
            with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural
            sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane. When we first
            discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she
            rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.
            For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity,
            then trembled and tottered, and—came down.
         </p>
         
         <p>At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession
            came over my spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I
            awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm. Our
            own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles,
            and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the
            descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion
            of her frame which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence,
            upon the rigging of the stranger.
         </p>
         
         <div class="pagebreak" id="#page205"></div>
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         
         <p>As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to
            the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the
            notice of the crew. With little difficulty I made my
            way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting
            myself in the hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An
            indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navi,
            gators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling
            to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to
            the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague
            novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore thought
            proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I did
            by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in
            such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.
         </p>
         
         <p>I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in
            the hold forced me to make use of it. A man passed by
            my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady
            gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of
            observing his general appearance. There was about it
            an evidence of great age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a
            low broken tone, some words of a language which I could
            not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of
            singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of
            a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no
            more.*	*	*	*	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul—a sensation which will admit of no
            analysis, to which the lessons of by-gone time are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me
            no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter
            consideration is an evil. I shall never—I know that I
            shall never—be satisfied with regard to the nature of my
            conceptions. Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense—a new entity is added
            to my soul. *	*	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible
            ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering
            to a focus. Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pas! me
            by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for
            the people trill not see. It was but just now that I
            passed directly before the eyes of the mate—it was no
            long while ago that I ventured into the captain’s own
            private cabin, and took thence the materials with which
            I write, and have written. I shall from time to time
            continue this journal. It is true that I may not find an
            opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will
            not fail to make the endeavour. At the last moment I
            will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the
            sea.*	*	*	*	*	* 
         </p>
         
         <p>An incident has occurred which has given me new
            room for meditation. Are such things the operation of
            ungoverned Chance? I had ventured upon deck and
            thrown myself down, without attracting any notice,
            among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails, in the bottom
            of the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my
            fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of
            a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a
            barrel The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship,
            and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out
            into the word DISCOVERY. *	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I
            think, a ship of war. Her rigging, build, and general
            equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind. What
            she is not, I can easily perceive—what she is I fear it is
            impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her
            huge size and overgrown suits of canvass, her severely
            simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally
            flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and
            there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows
            of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign
            chronicles and ages long ago. *	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She
            is built of a material to which I am a stranger. There
            is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me
            as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been
            applied. I mean its extreme porousnses, considered independently of the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the
            rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps
            an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood
            would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means.
         </p>
         
         <p>In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of
            an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon
            my recollection. “It is as sure,” he was wont to say,
            when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, “as
            sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in
            bulk like the living body of the seaman.” *	*
         </p>
         
         <p>About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among
            a group of the crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all,
            seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like the
            one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about
            them the marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double
            with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the
            wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken;
            their eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their
            gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest. Around
            them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete con struction.	*****
         </p>
         
         <p>I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studdingsail. From that period the ship, being thrown dead off
            the wind, has continued her terrific course due south,
            with every rag of canvass packed upon her, from her
            trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every
            moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of man
            to imagine. I have just left the deck, where I find it
            impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew
            seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to
            me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not
            swallowed up at once and forever. We are surely doomed
            to hover continually upon the brink of Eternity, without
            taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen,
            we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull;
            and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like
            demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple
            threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute
            these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which
            can account for such effect.—I must suppose the ship to
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page206"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            be within the influence of some strong current, or impe-
            tuous under-tow.	*	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own
            cabin—hut, as I expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is, to a casual observer,
            nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man
            —still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly my own height; that is,
            about five feet eight inches. He is of a well-knit and
            compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably
            otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face—it is the intense, the
            wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age so utter, so
            extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense—a sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled,
            seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.—
            His gray hairs are records of the past, and his grayer
            eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten
            charts. His head was bowed down upon his hands, and
            he pored, with a fiery unquiet eye, over a paper which I
            took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore
            the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as
            did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low
            peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the
            speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach
            my ears from the distance of a mile. * 	*
         </p>
         
         <p>The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of
            Eld. The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried
            centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning;
            and when their figures fall athwart my path in the wild
            glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have baen all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at
            Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul
            has become a ruin.	*	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former
            apprehensions. If I trembled at the blast which has
            hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the
            words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective!
            All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water;
            but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice,
            towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like
            the walls of the universe.	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if
            that appellation can properly be given to a tide which,
            howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to
            the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing
            of a cataract. *****
         </p>
         
         <p>To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume,
            utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions, predominates even over my
            despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect
            of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to
            some exciting knowledge—some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction. Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself. It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every
            probability in its favor. *	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous
            step; but there is upon their countenances an expression
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of de-
            spair.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as
            we carry a crowd of canvass, the ship is at times lifted
            bodily from out the sea——Oh, horror upon horror!
            
         </p>
         <p>the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and
            we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles,
            round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre,
            the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and
            the distance. But little time will be left me to ponder
            upon my destiny—the circles rapidly grow small—we
            are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool—
            and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of
            ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God!
            and—going down.

            </span>Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perished of an ortolan. L'histoire en est brère. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!
         </p>
         
         <p>A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting, indolent, to the Chaussée D'Antin, from
            its home in far Peru. From its queenly possessor La Bel
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page207"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>lissima, to the Due De L’Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.
         </p>
         
         <p>That night the Due was to sup alone. In the privacy
            of his bureau he reclined languidly on that ottoman, for
            which he sacrificed his loyalty in outbidding his king,—
            the notorious ottoman of Cadet.
         </p>
         
         <p>He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes!
            Unable to restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an
            olive. At this moment the door gently opens to the
            sound of soft music, and lo! the most delicate of birds
            is before the most enamored of men! But what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of
            the Due ?—“Horreur!—chien!—Baptiste —I’oiseau!
            ah, bon Dieu! cet oiseau modeste que tu as deshabillé de
            ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans papier!" It is superfluous to say more:—the Due expired in a paroxysm
            of disgust. *	*	*	*	*
         </p>
         
         <p>“Ha! ha! ha!”, said his Grace on the third day af-
            ter his decease.
         </p>
         
         <p>“He! he! he!”, replied the Devil faintly, drawing
            himself up with an air of hauteur.
         </p>
         
         <p>“Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Omelette. “I have sinned—c'est vrai—but, my good sir,
            consider!—you have no actual intention of putting such
            —such—barbarous threats into execution.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“No what ?” said his majesty— "come, sir, strip!”
            “Strip, indeed!—very pretty i’ faith!—no, sir, I shall
            not strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Due De L’Omelette, Prince de Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of
            the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and Member of the Academy, should
            divest myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons
            ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest robe-de-chambre ever put together byRombert—to say nothing of the taking
            my hair out of paper—not to mention the trouble I should
            have in drawing off my gloves?”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of
            the Fly. I took thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin
            inlaid with ivory. Thou wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent thee,—my Inspector
            of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou sayest were
            made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen drawers, and thy robe-de-chambre is a shroud of no scanty dimensions.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Sir!” replied the Due, “I am not to be insulted with
            impunity!—Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of
            avenging this insult!—Sir! you shall hear from me! In
            the meantime au revoir!”—and the Due was bowing
            himself out of the Satanic presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman in waiting.—
            Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged
            his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his
            identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.
         </p>
         
         <p>The apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pronounced it bien comme il faut. It was not its length nor
            its breadth,—but its height—ah, that was appalling!—
            There was no ceiling—certainly none—but a dense whirling inass of fiery-colored clouds. His Grace’s brain reeled as he glanced upwards. From above, hung a chain
            of an unknown blood-red metal—its upper end lost, like
            the city of Boston, parmi let nues. From its nether extremity swung a large cresset. The Due knew it to be a
            ruby; but from it there poured a light so intense, so still,
            to terrible, Persia never worshipped such—Gheber never
            imagined such—Mussulman never dreamed of such when,
            drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies,
            his back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo.
            The Due muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.
         </p>
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         <p>The corners of the room were rounded into niches.—
            Three of these were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty was Grecian, their deformity
            Egyptian, their tout ensemble French. In the fourth
            niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. But
            then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De L’Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes,
            raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a blush.
         </p>
         
         <p>But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a
            thousand and the same! And Rafaelle has beheld them!
            Yes, Rafaelle has been here; for did he not paint the——?
            and was he not consequently damned? The paintings!
            —the paintings! O luxury! 0 love!—who, gazing on
            those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty
            devices of the golden frames that besprinkle, like stars,
            the hyacinth and the porphyry walls?
         </p>
         
         <p>But the Due’s heart is fainting within him. He is not,
            however, as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor
            drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable
            censers. C'est vrai que de toutes ces choses il a pense
            beaucoup—mais! The Due De L’Omelette is terrorstricken; for, through the lurid vista which a single uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most
            ghastly of all fires!
         </p>
         
         <p>Le pauvre Duc! He could not help imagining that
            the glorious, the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies
            which pervaded that hall, as they passed filtered and
            transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the
            hopeless and the damned! And there, too !—there!—
            upon that ottoman!—who could he be?—he, the petilmaitre—no, the Deity—who sat as if carved in marble,
            et qui sourit, with his pale countenance, si amérement?
         </p>
         
         <p>Mais il faut agir,—that is to say, a Frenchman never
            faints outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De
            L’Omelette is himself again. There were some foils
            upon a table—some points also. The Due had studied 
            under B——; il avail tue ses six homines. Now, then,
            il peut s'échapper. He measures two points, and, with
            a grace inimitable, offers his majesty the choice, Horreur! his Majesty does not fence!
         </p>
         
         <p>Mais il joue!—how happy a thought!—but his Grace
            had always an excellent memory. He had dipped in the
            “ Diable” of the Abbe Gualtier. Therein it is said “que
            le Diable n’ose pas refuser un jeu d'écarte."
         </p>
         
         <p>But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but
            scarcely more desperate than the Due. Besides, was he
            not in the secret?—had he not skimmed over Père Le
            Bran?—was he not a member of the Club Vingt-un?—
            “Si je perds," said he, “je serai deux fois perdu—I
            shall be doubly damned—votla tout! (Here his Grace
            shrugged his shoulders) Si je gagne, je reviendrai à
            mes ortolans—que les cartes soient préparées!”
         </p>
         
         <p>His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all
            confidence. A spectator would have thought of Francis
            and Charles. His Grace thought of his game. His Majesty did not think; he shuffled. The Duc cut.
         </p>
         
         <p>The cards are dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it
            is—the king! No—it was the queen. His Majesty curs-
            ed her masculine habiliments. De L’Omelette placed
            his hand upon his heart.
         </p>
         
         <p>They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His
            Majesty counts heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The
            Due slips a card.
         </p>
         
         <p>"C'est à rous à faire," said his Majesty, cutting. His
            Grace bowed, dealt, and arose from the table en presentant le Roi.

         <p>His Majesty looked chagrined.</p>
         
         <p>Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have
            been Diogenes; and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, “que s'il n'eut pas été Be L’Omelette il n'aurait point d’objection d’etre le Diable."

         <div class="head">The Falling Star.</div>
         
         <p>It was deep midnight, and no moon shone, but the thousand stars of heaven looked down upon the sleeping
            earth, and kept their watch for her. A fair girl knelt by 
            the bed of the dying minstrel—she was his sister. She
            had tended him for many days with an untiring love—she
            would not that an alien eye should catch his latest look,
            or menial hand minister to his latest earthly want. For
            many hours she had not left his side, but kneeling there,
            with one hand clasped in her upraised hands, she gazed
            alternately from him to the vast heaven, searching its
            inmost depths with an untiring ken, as if she would tear
            from out its mystic heart the secret of a fate so interwoven
            with hers. But no sign came, and she turned and wept.
            Oh! the deep agony of that young heart! It was an unalloyed sorrow, which admitted of no earthly consolation. They were alone—these two young hearts—and
            other tie had none. All they had loved were in the
            grave, and they awoke one day as from a trance, and
            looked around and cried out for a friend, but they found
            none, and from that day they were one heart. They were
            both beautiful, and genius had been their heritage, and
            grew alike in both, only that hers was much less bold
            than His, for that it had received its tone from her sweet
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>gentleness, mixed with deep reverence for his more reasoning mind—as the gazer on water sees some bright star
            reflected on its bosom, and sees they are alike, save that
            the image is more shadowy, which is but caused by the
            properties of that in which it shows. So wrapt were
            they in each other, that the outer world had no charm for
            them, saving its humanities; the follies of fashion and
            the frivolities of life were unknown to them. They had
            drawn around them a magic circle, in which nought save
            what was bright and beautiful dare enter. Day after day
            did they gather wisdom from the pages of the mighty
            dead, and as the old world opened to their ardent minds,
            the present faded as a dream. They loved to dwell upon
            some tale of rare affection, of deep devotion, or self-immolation at the shrine of duty—instances of which the
            Past has in perfection, gilded perhaps by the romance a
            lapse of time never fails to bestow, but still unaffectedly
            human. And when they rose from their labor of love,
            they felt the deep effect which lessons of exalted virtue
            ever impress on reflecting minds. They impart a dignity to life which is unobserved in the every-day world,
            and link the heart to its kind by the noblest sentiments
            that nature can evince. They were the Philanthropists
            of the closet, unbounded in their sympathy, but from their
            sensibility and refinement, all unfit to mingle with the
            coarser spirits of the world. What excited their benevolence in a mass would most probably cause disgust in the
            individual, and they would turn away heart-sick to find
            the world not what they thought it. They would mourn
            for the suffering million, but the leprous wretch in the
            filthy hovel would be a loathed and hideous object in their
            eyes. Such is the difference between the theoretical and
            the practical Christian—the one refines and gives out
            Utopian theories to the world, which never are adopted,
            benefitting no one, though not the less noble in their aim,
            —the other seeks out Misery in its home, and bars out
            hungering Famine from the starving wretch; and though
            the means of assistance may be small, the never-failing
            font of Sympathy skins over the wounds it cannot radically heal. They saw that the world was beautiful, and
            were content to breathe the odor of its flowers, without
            distilling the poison from their hearts. They were dreamers, and had they been separate, such feelings would
            have craved the sympathy of some kindred heart, and
            they might have loved; but they were all in all to each
            other; their feelings were so knit, so interwoven, that
            the approach of any other sentiment seemed to threaten a
            disruption of the tie, and they sensitively and gladly
            shrank back into the gentle and unreserved commune of
            their own pure thoughts. They were orphans, and friendless,—they were alone, and loving! And now the sister
            knelt by the side of her dying brother! That was her
            grief;—for him her tears flowed fast, and the visible silence was broken by deep and fervent prayers. But the
            fever raged with unabated violence,—he muttered wild
            words, which conjured up the vision of a thousand happy hours, and caused a fresh burst of grief from the
            spirit-broken girl. The malady was evidently approaching its crisis; every moment the stillness became more
            awful. She longed to call for some one to share her
            watch, yet could not for a moment tear herself from the
            couch. He had breathed hardly until now, but now she
            missed the sound—it had sunk to a child’s breathing—
            and faint and frequent throbbed the pulses at his heart:—
            the eye which had been glaring and restless became fixed;—she longed to scream, but the voice seemed frozen
            at her heart, More feebly still he breathed; an expres
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page209"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            sion of agony was on his brow; his hand relaxed its
            grasp, and with one deep sigh his features faded into a
            quiet smile; his spirit seemed to have left its earthly
            home! Throwing her despairing eyes to heaven, she
            shrieked, “Oh, God, have mercy!”—And a bright star
            fell!
         </p>
         
         <p>But he recovered, and a week hence was seated on a
            couch, with that fair girl nestling at his feet. *	*	*
            ****	*	*	*	* * I "have been a grievous
            trouble to thee, Marian! Thine eye is as bright, thy
            smile as sweet, but thy cheek is pale, and thy hands have
            shrunk to thinness. And I fear that in my sadness, I may
            have spoken harsh words to thee, or have been wilful and
            fretful, or wishful and exacting; but now I crave your
            pardon, dearest, and throw myself upon your love for your
            forgiveness." “Hush! hush!” said Marian, as she placed
            her hand upon his mouth—“dear Ernest, most wrongfully
            do you accuse yourself;—both gentle and patient were
            you during all your sufferings; no murmur fell from your
            lips; no repining—no impatience—and every office I performed for you was more than repaid by the look of love
            and thankfulness with which it was received.” “But—”
            “Nay, hear me. If I have lost the ruddiness of health
            from off my cheek and its fullness from my form, it was
            not caused by watching and waiting upon your couch,
            but by the ever present fear that you might be taken from
            me. It tortured me through the day, and affrighted me
            in the night. I could not fly from the thought. I read it
            in the setting sun—in the flickering taper—and as the
            stars came out, and faded as the night wore on, each
            seemed to bear upon it a ray of mystic recognition of
            your embodied spirit.” “I have but faint remembrance
            of the past. I know the days—though cheered by sight
            of you—seemed endless.” “’Twas strange, too, Earnest;
            throughout the day you would appear strangely unsettied; a feverish restlessness seemed to pervade your 
            frame; but as the night came on this was superseded by
            a calmness, trance-like, nay, almost deathly, that made
            my blood stagnate in every vein—at those times, with a
            a philosophy which failed me utterly in the day, I would
            speculate upon the possibility of your death—and all at
            once I seemed to cease to be a being of the earth—the
            mystic line was spoken, and my mind was cognizant of
            the immaterial elements. Countless bright shapes peopled the circumambient air—if shapes they could be called that were without a form or substance. I was in the
            heart of Nature, and I saw how the progress of decay
            was but a preface to another birth—a state of being in
            which soul was all—I was conscious of an elevation of
            mind, an expansion of intellect, which rendered the deepsought, stored-up knowledge of a thousand generations
            of men, but as a grain of sand to the earth’s gross bulk—
            and I saw that those of earth who approached nearest
            to the imagination of a state of being which in truth
            surpasses all that the powers of imagination can conjure up, were those who in the earnestness of a beneficent nature sought out the Humanities from Wisdom’s
            page, and blending both, saw nature through the heart
            and mind—neither with the misjudging warmth of the
            enthusiast, nor the fact-deducing coldness of the philosopher—but offering at her shrine the uttermost attainable refinement of intellect, warmed by the Spirit of angelic Love! I saw through the world, man yearning unceasingly to rise, the soul warring with its human-being clay, and striving ever to sever from it—the pale
            student in his midnight study, burying the recollection
            of the miseries of the by-gone day, forgetting the want
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>of friends, the cold repulse, the unappreciation, the
            want of sympathy, the hungering morrow, in his absorbing loye of the truth—the haughty statesman retiring from the admiring crowd, and seeking consolation
            in seclusion from those aspiring but baseless hopes that
            sought to raise the herd from its desperate besotted
            state,—repaid by revilement, scorn, and disbelief, by
            that very class he sought to benefit;—and, seeking in that
            solitude deep commune with his own heart, he sought to
            work out, from the philosophy of the past and the sad
            experience of the present, a state of mind in which the
            desire of dispensing happiness should be of itself sufficient compensation apart and independent of the reception of the benefit by the object of it. Thus deeply pondering and in secret, the quiet came upon his soul and
            he became of us. I cannot describe to you the nameless
            feeling that possessed me at those times—there was a
            consciousness of existence, without its cares; of knowledge without the blindness of prejudice which ever accompanies our earthly wisdom. I felt that I was apart
            from the world, yet of it; for that sympathy which pervades all nature, which binds heart to heart, and is the
            medium through which human sensations and affections
            are felt alike and conveyed throughout the universe now
            and forever, was acting upon my spirit with a mighty
            force; my nature was etherealized, and I was in an impalpable though sentient link of that wondrous harmonizer of creation, Sympathy or Love! And you were there,
            my brother;—our spirits met in that bright star with
            which we have so oft imagined that our fates were inseparably connected.”
         </p>
         
         <p>“Stay, Marian, dearest, thou dost remember me, that
            as I lay upon my bed of sickness, I had a dream of a
            most terrible and strange import. I know that for days
            I lay unconscious of all, save of an intolerable and raging fever, that seemed to dry up all moisture in my
            blood and brain. I seemed to breathe hot air, which, in
            its passage, dried up my tongue, and parched and cracked my livid lips. Day and night revolved, but Time
            seemed to have stayed its course. Each day, as it broke,
            brought with it an increasing but nameless terror, which,
            ever and anon, like unto ice-strings made each trembling
            nerve; and, though the fury of a thousand fires leaped
            through each vein, my heart felt chill. On that night
            which caused thee so much terror, this harassing feeling
            was upon me, and grappled me with a giant’s hand; nor
            could I fortify myself against it, for my mind seemed to
            have lost the power of connecting ideas of any kind;—all
            was vagueness and dread. As the night wore on, the increasing stillness added a new terror to my mind. Methought I lay chained and immovable in the midst of a
            vast sandy plain, over which the hot sun was vertical—
            throughout the day, from morn till night, he poured his
            fierce beams upon my seething skin, until I felt it crack
            and gape like the parched earth; and when the sun had
            set, the moon’s rays and the beams of the golden stars
            seemed to have fire that scorched my brain to madness.
            There was no rest for me, night nor day—my fevered
            tongue could not give out my agony. And I was alone in
            my suffering—when suddenly a mighty form approached.
            It was of a grave but beautiful aspect—and on its brow
            there was a calm that chilled at once my burning blood.
            It seemed as if it had never known a youth, nor could
            know age—it was not the calm of thought, nor the passiveness of overwhelming grief, but I felt at once that it
            was the cold, eternal calm of Death. Nearer it came on,
            and my soul recoiled at its approach. Nearer, still near
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page210"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            er—it had gained my feet, when in a moment the cells of
            memory gave up their treasured store. Father, mother,
            friends came flocking around me—our happy home and
            childish sports; each happy hour, that in its passage bore
            a pleasant thought; snatches of old wild melodies, and
            all the thousand things that endeared and made a joy of
            life, rushed forth to keep the dreaded terror off,—but in
            vain! It paused not in its career—it raised its hands
            above me—a cold sweat stood upon my brow—I strove to
            speak, but no sound came forth—and struggled to arise, 
            but the mighty spell withheld me, and I was sinking fast, 
            Slowly the withering hand descended towards my heart, 
            —already did I feel its grasp stilling the pulse of life,— 
            my soul paused, wavering, ere it took its flight, when on 
            the still night air the deep and fervent prayers of thy innocent heart arose, and from the orbed heaven rushed
            forth a radiant form, and stood between me and my dreaded foe”—

         <p>The Broken Vow and Other Poems. By Amanda M. Ed-
            mond. Boston: Gould, Kendall if Lincoln.
         </p>
         
         <p>An octavo of more than 320 pages, beautifully printed
            on fine paper, “embellished” with six expensive steel engravings (including a portrait of the authoress,) and
            showily as well as substantially bound.
         </p>
         
         <p>The name—Amanda-M. Edmond—is quite unknown to
            us: although if we may judge from the number of poems
            contained in the volume (110) the fair poetess must have
            been for several years before the public. Perhaps, however, she may have employed a nom-de-plume, or written 
            altogether anonymously. We do not remember having
            before seen any one poem of the collection. They are by
            no means impressive. The subjects, generally, are such
            as find favor in boarding-schools. Many of the pieces
            are on abolition topics. Some of them, from their character, have no right to the title of poem, and should not
            have been included in the volume: we refer to such
            things as “Washing-Day” and “Illi cui Carmina applicent"—mere doggrel. In the minor merits Miss Edmond
            is not particularly deficient. Her English, her versification, and her imagery, are at least respectable—but in
            the virtues of the Muse—in the loftier and distinctive attributes, we are pained to say that she is totally wanting. We look in vain throughout her volume for one
            spark of poetic fire. In justice, we cull what we consider the best specimen of her powers:

            <br></br>Beautiful moon! oh, how I love to hail
            
            <br></br>Thy glorious coming in the eastern sky,
            
            <br></br>When starry gems along thy pathway lie,

            <br></br>Wreathing with light the fleecy cloud that veils
            
            <br></br>With its thin mantle, for a little space,
            
            <br></br>The full-orbed lustre of thy beaming face—
            
            <br></br>Casting thy splendor on the sleeping dales,
            
            <br></br>Fields, woods and waters that beneath thee rest,

         <p>We have said that the English of Miss Edmond is ge
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>nerally respectable; but in the very first sentence of the
            Preface there is an ambiguity which, in a second edition,
            should be cleared up. “A poetical contribution” says
            the poetess, “offered to the public, presupposes in the
            author the existence of the true spirit of song.” Now a
            poetical contribution, so offered, presupposes in the author only about the ten thousandth part of what Miss Edmond (no doubt through mere grammatical inadvertence)
            has maintained it to presuppose. The “poetical contribution” presupposes in the author not the existence but
            the conviction of the existence, of “the true spirit of
            song”—and here there is about the same difference as
            between Peter Schlemil and his Shadow.

            <br></br>Series Part I.
         </div>
         
         <p>Of the first series of the Table-Talk we spoke so fully
            in a previous number, that it will be needless to say anything of the second—which is, of course, a continuation.
            In lieu of any comments from ourselves, therefore, we
            make a quotation of some length, on a topic of deep interest treated as only Hazlitt could treat it:
         </p>
         
         <p>Capacity is not the same thing as genius. Capacity may be
            described to relate to the quantity of knowledge, however acquired;
            genius to its quality and the mode of acquiring it. Capacity is
            a power over given ideas or combinations of ideas; genius is the
            power over those which are not given, and for which no obvious
            or precise rule can be laid down. Or capacity is power of any
            sort: genius is power of a different sort from what has yet been
            shown. A retentive memory, a clear understanding is capacity,
            but it is not genius. The admirable Crichton was a person of prodigious capacity; but there is no proof (that I know of) that he
            had an atom of genius. His verses that remain are dull and sterile. He could learn all that was known or any subject; he could
            do anything if others could show him the way to do it. This was
            very wonderful; but that is all you can say of it. It requires a
            good capacity to play well at chess ; but alter all, it is a game of
            skill, and not of genius. Know what you will of it, the understanding still moves in certain tracks in which others have trod
            before it, quicker or slower, with more or less comprehension and
            presence of mind. The greatest skill strikes out nothing for itself,
            from its own peculiar resources; the nature of the game is a thing
            determinate and fixed; there is no royal or poetical road to checkmate your adversary. There is no place for genius but in the indefinite and unknown. The discovery of the binomial theorem
            was an effort of genius: but there was none shown in Jedediah
             Buxton’s being able to multiply 9 figures by 9 in his head. If he
            could have multiplied 90 figures by 90 instead of nine, it would
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page211"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            have been equally useless toil and trouble.
            <span class="anchor" id="a002">

            </span>He is a man of capacity who possesses considerable intellectual riches: he is a man
            of genius who finds out a vein of new ore. Originality is the
            seeing nature different from all others, and yet as it is in itself.
            It is not singularity or affectation, but the discovery of new and
            valuable truth. All the world do not see the whole meaning of
            any object they have been looking at. Habit blinds them to some
            things; short-sightedness to others. Every mind is not a guage
            and measure of truth. Nature has her surface and her dark recesses. She is deep, obscure, and infinite. It is only minds on
            whom she makes her fullest impressions that can penetrate her
            shrine or unveil her Holy of Holies. It is only those whom she
            has filled with her spirit that have the boldness or the power to reveal her mysteries to others. But nature has a thousand aspects,
            and one man can only draw out one of them. Whoever does this,
            is a man of genius. One displays her force, another her refinement, one her power of harmony, another her suddenness of contrast, one her beauty of form, another her splendor of color. Each
            does that for which he is best fitted by his particular genius, that
            is to say, by some quality of mind into which the quality of the
            object sinks deepest, where it finds the most cordial welcome, is
            perceived to its utmost extent, and where again it forces its way
            out from the fulness with which it has taken possession of the
            mind of the student. The imagination gives out what it has first
            absorbed by congeniality of temperament, what it has attracted
            and moulded into itself by elective affinity, as the loadstone draws
            and impregnates iron. A little originality is more esteemed and
            sought for than the greatest acquired talent, because it throws a
            new light upon things, and is peculiar to the individual. The
            other is common; and may be had for the asking, to any
            amount.
         </p>
         
         <p>The value of any work is to be judged of by the quantity of
            originality contained in it. A very ltttle of this will go a great
            way. If Goldsmith had never written anything but the two or
            three first chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield, or the character of
            a Village Schoolmaster, they would have stamped him a man of
            genius. The Editors of Encyclopedias are not usually reckoned
            the first literary characters of the age. The works, of which they
            have the management, contain a great deal of knowledge, like
            chests or warehouses, but the goods are not their own. We should
            as soon think of admiring the shelves of a library; but the shelves
            of a library are both useful and respectable. I was once applied
            to in a delicate emergency, to write an article on a difficult subject
            for an Encyclopedia, and was advised to take time and give it a
            systematic and scientific form, to avail myself of all the knowledge
            that was to be obtained on the subject, and arrange it with clearness and method. I made answer that as to the first, I had taken
            time to do all that I ever pretended to do, as I had thought incessantly on difierent matters for twenty years of my life;
            <span class="anchor" id="a003">
               <a href="#n003"> Link </a>
            </span>that I had
            no particular knowledge of the subject in question, and no head
            for arrangement; and that the utmost I could do in such a case
            would be, when a systematic and scientific article was prepared, to
            write marginal notes upon it, to insert a remark or illustration of
            ray own (not to be found in former Encyclopedias) or to suggest a
            better definition than had been offered in the text. There are two
            sorts of writing. The first is compilation; and consists in collecting and stating all that is already known of any question
            in the best possible manner, for the benefit of the uninformed
            
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>reader. An author of this class is a very learned amanuensis of
            other people’s thoughts. The second sort proceeds on an entirely
            different principle. Instead of bringing down the account of
            knowledge to the point at which it has already arrived, it professes to start from that point on the strength of the writer’s individual reflections; and supposing the reader in possession of
            what is already known, supplies deficiencies, fills up certain
            blanks, and quits the beaten road in search of new tracts of observation or sources of feeling. It is in vain to object to this last
            style that it is disjointed, disproportioned, and irregular: It is
            merely a set of additions and corrections to other men’s works, or
            to the common stock of human knowledge, printed separately.
            You might as well expect reasoning in the notes to a book. It
            skips all the trite, intermediate, level common-places of the subject,
            and only stops at the difficult passages of the human mind, or
            touches on some striking point that has been overlooked in previous editions. A view of a subject, to be connected and regular,
            cannot be all new. A writer will always be liable to be charged
            either with paradox or common-place, either with dulness or affectation. But we have no right to demand from any one more than
            he pretends to. There is indeed a medium in all things, but to
            unite opposite excellences is a task ordinarily too hard for mortality. The man who succeeds in what he aims at, or who takes
            the lead in any one mode or path of excellence, may think himself
            very well off. It would not be fair to complain of the style of an
            Encyclopedia as dull, as wanting volatile salt; nor of the style of
            an Essay because it is too light and sparkling, because it is not a
            caput mortuvm. So it is rather an odd objection to a work that it is
            made up entirely of “brilliant passages”—at least it is a fault that
            can be found with few works, and the book might be pardoned for
            its singularity. The censure might indeed seem like adroit flattery, if it were not passed on an author whom any objection is sufficient to render unpopular and ridiculous. I grant it is best to
            unite solidity with show, general information with particular ingenuity. This is the pattern of a perfect style; but I myself do not
            pretend to be a perfect writer. In fine, we do not banish light
            French wines from our tables, or refuse to taste sparkling Champagne when we can get it, because it has not the body of Old Port.
            Besides, I do not know that dulness is strength, or that an observation is slight, because it is striking. Mediocrity, insipidity, want
            of character, is the great fault. Mediocribus esse poctis non Dii, non
            homines, non concessére columna. Neither is this privilege allowed
            to prose-writers in our time, any more than to poets formerly.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is not then acuteness of organs or extent of capacity that constitutes rare genius, or produces the most exquisite models of art,
            but an intense sympathy with some one beauty or distinguished
            characteristic in nature. Irritability alone, or the interest taken
            in certain things, may supply the place of genius in weak and
            otherwise ordinary minds. As there are certain instruments fitted
            to perform certain kinds of labor, there arc certain minds so framed
            as to produce certain chéf-d'æuvres in art and literature, which is
            surely the best use they can be put to. If a man had all sorts of
            instruments in his shop, and wanted one, he would rather have
            that one than be supplied with a double set of all the others. It
            he had them all twice over, he could only do what he can do as it
            is, whereas without that one perhaps he cannot finish any one work
            he has in hand. So if a man can do one thing better than any
            body else, the value of this one thing is what he must stand or fall
            by, and his being able to do a hundred other things merely as well
            as any body else, would not alter the sentence or add to his respectability; on the contrary, his being able to do so many other things
            well would probably interfere with and encumber him in the execution of the only thing that others cannot do as well as he, and so
            far be a drawback and a disadvantage. More people in fact fail
            from a multiplicity of talents and pretensions, than from an absolute poverty of resources. I have given instances of this elsewhere Perhaps Shakspeare’s tragedies would in some respects
            have been better, if he had never written comedies at all; and
            in that case his comedies might well have been spared, though
            they might have cost us some regret. Racine, it is said, might
            have rivalled Molière in comedy; but he gave up the cultivation
            of his comic talents to devote himself wholly to the tragic Muse.—
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page212"></div>
            If, as the French tell us, he in consequence attained to the perfection of tragic composition, this was better than writing comedies
            as well as Molière and tragedies as well as Crebrillon. Yet I count
            those persons tools, who think it a pity that Hogarth did not succeed better in serious subjects. The division of labor is an excellent principle in taste as well as mechanics. Without this, I find
            by Adam Smith, we could not have a pin made to the degree of
            perfection it is. We do not, on any rational scheme of criticism,
            inquire into the variety of a man’s excellences, or the number of
            his works, or his facility of production. Venice Preserved is sufficient tor Otway’s fame. I hate all those nonsensical stories about
            Lopez de Vega, and his writing a play in the morning before
            breakfast. He had time enough to do it alter. If a man leaves
            behind him any work which is a model in its kind, we have no
            right to ask whether he could do any thing else, or how he did it,
            or how long he was about it. All that talent which is not necessary to the actual quantity of excellence existing in the world, loses
            its object, is so much waste talent, or talent to let. I heard a sensible man say, he should like to do some one thing better than all
            the rest of the world. Why should a man do more than his part?
            The rest is vanity and vexation of spirit. We look with jealous
            and grudging eye at all those qualifications which are not essential; first because they are superfluous, and next, because we suspect they will be prejudicial. Why does Mr. Kean play all those
            harlequin tricks of singing, dancing, fencing, &amp;c.? They say, “It
            is for his benefit.” It is not for his reputation. Garrick, indeed,
            shone equally as well in comedy and tragedy. But he was first,
            not second-rate in both. There is not a greater impertinence than
            to ask if a man is clever out of his profession. I have heard of
            people trying to cross examine Mrs. Siddons. I would as soon try
            to entrap one of the Elgin Marbles into an argument. Good nature
            and common sense are required from all people; but one proud
            distinction is enough for any one individual to possess or to aspire
            to!

         <p>Of course we admire all this—it is pointedly put—but
            we assent to only about one half of it.

         <p>A beantifully printed volume of nearly 650 pages.
            Captain Siborne, it is well understood, had access, through
            his staff appointment, as well as through private interest, to the most authentic sources of information, and his
            work was looked for with the greatest interest in England, as one that would settle a great many disputed
            points in reference to the Waterloo campaigns. Since
            the issue of the book, much has been said against it—
            but a very great deal more in its favor, and we ure inclined to side with its supporters. An unmistakeable
            air of candor pervades every page, and the accuracy of
            detail seems to be self-demonstrated. The manner is exceedingly good.

         <p>A volume of more than 500 pages octavo. It is rather
            a series of vivid pictures on the subject of the late War,
            than an Historical Sketch of it. Force and novelty
            abound, and we are never permitted to doubt the honesty
            of the narration, but there is a slight tinge of the whimsical about the book which may operate, in the first into prevent a very general appreciation of its merits—which are undoubtedly great. By way of exemplifiing our meaning we quote a brief passage from an account
            of Timothy Pickering.
         </p>
         
         <p>His reputation was that ot a consistent upright man, who lived
            and died firm to the conviction he cherished; hard but honest.
            On a great field day debate in 1841, on the Loan Bill, when the
            House, in committee of the whole, gave six weeks to those speeches for political capital at home and abroad, which are among the
            ways and means of free countries with a free press—much preferable to more serious combats—Mr. Pickering, in the course of his
            harangue, looking through his spectacles full in the chairman’s
            face, said, with great emphasis, swinging his long arm aloft, that
            he stood on a rock. “I stand on a rock’, said he “from which all
            democracy”—then raising his voice and repeatrng it—“not all
            democracy and hell to bool, can move me—the rock of integrity and
            truth."
         </p>
         
         <p>“These things are more honored in the breach than in
            the observance”—by silence than by historical record.
            The passage, too, will afford some idea of Mr. Ingersoll’s style which, like Mr. Pickering’s character, is
            “hard but honest”—as well as (more definitely) of his
            mere English, which is loose and uncouth to a very reprehensible degree. Take, for instance, the first paragraph of the volume:
         </p>
         
         <p>In this historical sketch I shall endeavor to submit the truth in
            an account of the contest between Great Britain and the United
            States of America, declared by Act of Congress, approved the 18th
            of June, 1812. It enacted that war was already declared to exist
            between the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, and
            the Dependencies thereof, and the U. S. of America and their territories; and that the President of the U. S. was thereby authorized
            to use the whole land and naval force of the U. S., to carry the
            same into effect, and to issue to private armed vessels of the U, S.,
            commissions, or letters of marque and general reprisal, in such
            form as he should think proper, and under the seal of the U. S.
            against the vessels, goods and effects of the government of the said
            United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the subjects
            thereof.
         </p>
         
         <p>Here a “contest” is “ declared.” Whether the “ thereby” in “thereby unauthorized” refers to the territories,
            the war, or the act, it is difficult to determine. “The
            same” is equally ambiguous as regards its reference, and
            it seems to be the “Seal of the U. S.” which is set
            “against the vessels, goods and effects” off the British.
            The whole paragraph is awkward in the extreme.
         </p>
         
         <p>But happily the value of the book does not depend upon
            trifles such as these. It gives a plain, discerning and evidently faithful view of the events of the war, and will be
            received with favor by all who are competent to decide
            upon the worth of an historical treatise.

         <p>The New Method of Ollendorf affords, unquestionably, the best means of studying the German. In no other grammar do we obtain so much information, so luminously given. His great merit is that he does not plunge
            in medias res res, but begins at the beginning. He presupposes no knowledge on the part of the beginner. Other
            German grammarians take for granted, among other gratuities, an intimate cognizance of the English. The
            work before us is especially rich, too, in its system of
            idiomatic instruction—and in every respect is invaluable.
            We speak feelingly on this subject; for we have felt the

            thousand difficulties and ambiguities of other grammars,
            which have been written by good Germanists, certainly,
            but, at the same time, by indifferent metaphysicians._
            To instruct, demands a thorough metaphysical educa-

         <p>National Gallery at the Rotunda.—We proceed
            to picture No. seven, the second of the Series:—we
            might say the second page of the History. In this it is
            evident that society has already made great strides towards civilization. The hunter has long passed away,
            and the shepherd is making room for the husbandman.—
            The locality is nearly, but not quite the same, as in the
            last picture; we have still the “boulder” promontory in
            the distance, but we have shifted our ground, and have
            moved to the right, and further from the river. Before
            us stands a group of glorious trees—primeval giants of
            the forest—beneath whose mighty arms
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            <br></br>The ground was never trenched by spade,

         <p>
            On the left rises a gentle hill, on which a ploughman is
            seen driving his share into the mellow earth, while in
            the middle distance on the bank of the river, stands an
            eminence crowned with a Druid’s Temple. At the foot,
            on a rock, we see a growing little town. White sails
            are on the sea, an on the shore we see and antique vessel on the stocks. Everything gives indication of an active people, yet all are not busy with the ruder cares of
            life, for the refining arts—Music and Painting—have already dawned. Beneath the shade of the mighty trees,
            we see maidens wreathed with flowers, dancing gaily
            and gracefully to the shepherd’s pipe, and on a huge
            stone (a rustic bridge) in the foreground, an embryo
            painter scrawls his first attempt at the pictorial art.—
            Near him his mother plies the busy spindle, while seated close at hand, an old man traces in the dust a geometrical figure, indicating the beginning of the abstruser
            sciences.
         </p>
         
         <p>The contemplation of this charming production carries
            us back to our boyish dreams of rural felicity all is
            beauty and joy, and but for the presence of an armed
            man, passing through the ravine up to the front of the
            picture, we might suppose it an illustration of the Poet’s
            “Golden Age.”
         </p>
         
         <p>The painter has chosen, with great propriety, the Druidical circle, as the rude temple of the earliest worshippers, while the volumes of smoke which issue from it in
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page214"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            dicate that living victims heap the altars of a sanguinary
            God.
         </p>
         
         <p>It were tedious to enumerate the thousand little objects
            which attract our attention, and the many delicate tints,
            of which words can convey no idea. As well might we
            attempt to give a description of the exquisite transitions
            of sound in a fine musical composition, as the delicate
            gradations of color from the full green of the foreground,
            to the faint blue haze of the distant landscape. We feel
            that it would be almost hypercritical to pick out faults in
            this composition, and yet the station we have assumed
            calls upon us to display our judgment, by finding fault,
            otherwise the public may conclude that we are no critics.
            Well, gentle readers, we will make an effort to gratify
            you, by wishing that the sheep in the middle ground
            were of an “improved breed,” as they make the shepherd appear too tall.

         <p>To all lovers of the true and beautiful in art we recommend a visit to the Ivory Christ, brought from Italy by
            C. Edwards Lester, our Consul at Genoa, and now being
            exhibited in Broadway opposite the Park. This figure
            (it cannot properly be called a statue) is the work of an
            Italian Monk, an educated man, but with little knowledge of art. A deep enthusiasm—an overwhelming passion to do justice to the intellectual and physical character of the God-man, seems to have been in this case at
            once the instigation and the instruction. The material
            is the tusk of an antique elephant—a tusk of enormous
            size. Much of it had to be cut away on account of its carious condition, and yet the figure is 32 inches long, (we
            believe) and 8 inches broad through the shoulders:—all
            this solid—the arms are wrought from separate pieces.
         </p>
         
         <p>The first point noticeable in this Christ is the intellectuality of its expression. All other representations of the
            Saviour make him merely benevolent, dignified, meek,
            self-sustained, and beautiful in feature. In this, mind—
            genius—predominates. The whole face is eminently intellectual.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second thing to be observed is the absolute truth
            of the entire design. The figure depends from the cross
            precisely as the human form would depend under the circumstances. The moment chosen is that immediately
            succeeding death. We are made to fancy that the last
            sigh has just issued from his lips—on which is now fading a divine smile. We can see, nevertheless, that
            the death has been agonizing. The contraction of
            the muscles, more particularly about the calves, toes
            and lumbar regions, are absolute in the truth of their
            expression. In anatomy the whole figure is perfect. We
            douht if a better model of the human frame is to be found
            anywhere. The work altogether is of a very high order
            of genius.
         </p>
         
         <p>In our next we shall endeavor to do justice to the inimitable Sortie du Bain—De Kuyper’s—now to be seen at
            the Society Library. We have no patience with those
            who decry it.

         <p>Trinity Church Organ.—Having been favored, by
            the kindness of Richard Upjohn, Esq., the gifted architect
            of Trinity Church, with an elegant drawing of the front
            elevation of the new Organ which will shortly be erected in that noble edifice, we are enabled this week to afford a similar gratification to our readers, by presenting
            them with a fine engraving on steel of the same, executed by James Duthie.
         </p>
         
         <div class="columnbreak"></div>
         <p>In order to render this the more interesting and intelligible, we have procured from Dr. Edward Hodges, who
            first planned, and now has the oversight and superintendence of the construction of the interior of the ponderous
            instrument, the following particulars concerning its dimensions and intended contents.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of the beautiful and appropriate design of the organ front and
            subjacent screen, harmonizing as it does with the imposing effect
            of the interior of the building, I need not say anything; the drawing will speak for itself. The whole is to be of oak, and much of
            it has already been executed in a most thoroughly substantial and
            workmanlike manner.
         </p>
         
         <p>The height of the screen to the level of the floor of the organ
            loft is 14 feet 5 inches; above which the Organ will tower 38 feet
            farther; making a total elevation of nearly 53 feet.
         </p>
         
         <p>The width of the organ front is 24 feet, but as the floor will be
            trussed out about 4 feet on each side as well as towards the nave,
            the width of the organ-loft will be 34 feet—thus affording abundant room for an effective choir, should it be finally resolved to place
            the choir at that (the wrong) end of the church. This gallery or
            organ-loft will be surrounded, on three sides, by latticed work to a
            considerable altitude, as seen in the drawing.
         </p>
         
         <p>The only way to give a just idea of the nature and extent of
            an Organ, is by stating its leading divisions (e. g. an Organ of
            two, three, or more ranks of keys,) enumerating the stops, and giving the magnitudes of the largest pipes connected with each department, to which all the rest are adjusted in a well known proportional order. Simply to state the number of stops and the
            number of pipes pertaining to each, can communicate no accurate or satisfactory information; for, as the magnitudes in descending the scale increase in geometrical progression, it may happen that a dozen pipes in one organ may require and occupy as
            much room as a thousand pipes in another, or in another part of
            the same instrument. We cannot estimate the power or effect of
            an organ, therefore, by the number of its pipes; any more than
            we could that of a ship of war merely by learning the number of
            guns she carries, without ascertaining whether they are four
            pounders or Paixhan sixty-fours. Suffice it then to add here, for
            the sake of those who have no technical acquaintance with the
            subject, that the lengths of the pipes intended for the Trinity organ vary from nearly thirty feel to something less than an inch,
            and the diameters from three feet to the size of a small goose-quill.
         </p>
         
         <p>A custom has obtained amongst organists and organ-builders
            of naming the pipes and the notes which bear the denomination
            of the letter C in various octaves of the great scale, by the convenient designation of a round number of feet, not precisely accurate as to the actual admeasurement, but near the truth. Thus we
            speak of 2 feet C, of 4 feet C, See. (each octave doubling the foregoing;) and when we come to the bottom, of 32 feet C, although,
            it the pipe be of larger diameter it may not exceed 28 or 29 feet.
            One cause of this has probably been the successive changes of
            pitch, to accommodate modern orchestral instruments; which changes, until a very recent period, were invariably towards the sharper or more acute limit of the scale of musical sounds. And, of
            course, organ-builders have been nothing loath to fall into the prevailing fashion in (his respect, seeing that when the pitch had ascended but a single semitone (and it has been supposed to have
            varied thrice as much,) it lessened the magnitude, the weight, and
            the cost of any given instrument by at least as much as a twentieth part of the whole. At present a check seems to have been
            put upon this innovating tendency, and the pitch may be considered as settled. The public, however, ought to be made aware of the
            fact that fraud can be practised in this particular, and that the pitch
            of an organ is not an affair of so small consequence as some persons would represent it to be.
         </p>
         
         <p>There is deception of another species not seldom exercised with
            regard to this complex instrument. Certain organ-builders, coming to the knowledge of the fact that in the hands of ignorant and
            unskilful organists, the note G G# in the extreme bass was seldom
            put in requisition, affected to consider that note as useless, and so
            omitted it; although, upon an ordinary G G organ this arrangement excluded the largest pipe but one iu every stop. And this

            practice (which originated, as candor requires me to confess, in
            England,) has continued to our day. Many such organs are still
            built, and advertised for sale—the compass being with audacious
            effrontery stated to be from G G upwards, without any mention
            tion made of this most important deficiency. But as long as good
            people are satisfied to order and purchase organs without any reference to persons competent to afford them professional advice on
            the subject, they must remain content to be duped.
         </p>
         
         <p>Thus much being premised, the following description may possibly become tolerably intelligible even to those who have not
            been initiated in the mysteries of the organ-craft:
         </p>
         
         <p>The Organ for Trinity Church, then, is to consist of four distinct
            departments, having three ranks of manual keys, and one of pedals, or keys for the feet. The manuals pertain to the Swell, the
            Great Organ, and the Choir Organ, respectively. The Swell is an
            organ of 4 ft.; (that, being, as before explained, the size of the
            longest pipe); the Choir Organ, (seen in front, projecting from the
            gallery,] an 8 ft. organ; the Great Organ, 16 ft.; the Pedal Organ,
            32 ft.

         <p>Little more remains than to give an enumeration of the stops,
            which are to be grouped right and left of the keys, as exhibited in

         <p>The compass or extent of the organs, respectively, is as follows:
            Of the Swell, four octaves and a half, or fifty-four keys; of the
            Choir organ, the same, although at an octave lower pitch, the latter ending at fin alt., the other at f in altissimo; of the Great Organ. five octaves and a half, or sixty-six keys; and of the Pedals,
            ‘wo octaves, or twenty-five keys. In connexion with this latter
            department there is this peculiarity, that the stop consists of thirty
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>seven pipes, and can be drawn so as to play two octaves from 32 ft.
            C, or two octaves from 16 ft. upwards; or both together. The stops
            called “Swell Bass” are also, properly speaking, pedal stops, although they can be acted upon by the manual keys also, so as to
            afford a great variety of effect.

         <p>The Swell is constructed upon the plan which I first introduced
            in England about twenty years ago, and a full description of which
            I drew up and published in the "(Quarterly Musical Magazine &amp;
            Review," vol. 8, No. xxxii., 1826. It may be briefly described as
            resembling in principle the ordinary refrigerator. It consists of
            three distinct boxes or cases, through each of which (when closed)
            the sound has to pass ere it reaches (he ear. Thus the most delicate effects, in the way of expression, are capable of being produced, by the gradual removal or interposition of obstacles to the
            transmission of sound.
         </p>
         
         <p>The Pedal keys likewise are as yet comparatively new in this
            country, being of brass. These I likewise introduced in England a
            year or two prior to my new swell, and described in No. xxxii of
            the periodical just mentioned. They must gradually make their
            way into extensive use, as they afford great facilities to the player,
            enabling him to do a great deal more with one foot than wa3 before
            at all practicable, and thus setting the other at liberty for the command of the swell.
         </p>
         
         <p>The number of coupling stops in the organ is, I believe, almost
            if not altogether unprecedented. They will conduce to almost interminable varieties of combinations. It would be a wearisome
            task to attempt to calculate them. There will, therefore, be great
            room for the exhibition of taste and skill in their adaptation to specific purposes of accompaniment, &amp;c.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. Henry Erben is the contractor, and the work has already
            made very considerable progress, nearly all the machinery of the
            organ being in a state of forwardness, at his spacious and wellfurnished factory in Centre street. The workmen employed deserve great credit for the masterly manner in which they have acquitted themselves hitherto in the construction of this unique instrument; and if the voicing of the pipes (not commenced) shall
            prove as satisfactory as the mechanism unquestionably is, the public may expect to hear an organ which will add to the attractions
            of this great city.
         </p>
         
         <p>I am afraid that my description will be found tediously long;
            but, like the witty Frenchman who apologized to his friend for
            sending him so long a letter, I must say that I had not time to
            write it shorter.

         <p>Mr. Duffield comes to us from the Western country,
            and the only recommendation we have seen of his talent
            j is copied from some Westem paper, and concludes with
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page216"></div>
            <div class="columnbreak"></div>
            something to this effect:—“He never sings the song
            “Fifty years ago” without receiving demonstrations of
            delight from a buck-eyed auditory.” This is praise considerable, but we do not think it will weigh much with
            our Northern people. Mr. Duffield has a light, pleasing
            and melodious voice, but of its compass and power we
            were unable to judge, for his intonation was so faulty,
            and his manner so cold and uncultivated, that we rarely
            heard the true quality of his organ. However, the indications were sufficient to warrant the opinion, that, with
            careful and hard study, he may become an ornament to
            his profession. His last song was “Stand to your guns.”
            It requires great descriptive powers, a vast deal of energy, and a most powerful voice. Mr, Duffield, at present,
            lacks all these qualifications, and consequently the song
            was a failure. He took the tempo of the song nearly one
            half too slow; at least, the conductor, Mr. Hill, lead the
            song off too slow, and the singer followed—but presently
            Mr. Duffield, by a variety of expressive gestures, intimated his wish that the time should be increased; the conductor took the hint, and communicated the same to the
            band, which ultimately consented to accede to their united wishes.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of Miss Northall we spoke last week, and we saw no
            reason on this occasion to alter our opinion then expressed. She has a most beautiful voice, and we should be
            delighted to find that she cultivated it to advantage, for
            she is quite young yet, and has, we hope, many years in
            prospective which may yield her high honor and large
            profit. In her last song, with orchestral accompaniments, it was really painful to hear how the conductor
            labored with hands and feet to impress the tempo upon
            the band, and it was equally painful to observe what very
            little success attended his efforts.
         </p>
         
         <p>Of Ole Bull we have much to say, both in praise and
            in condemation. We cannot but admire his adagio performances; they are full of passion and sentiment. His
            allegros are brilliant and forcible, and his scherzos are
            piquant and striking; but with all these undoubted excellences, there is mingled so much of trickery and what
            is termed professional “gaggery,” that the beauties are
            often clouded, and sometimes quite obscured. Many of
            his peculiarities are undoubtedly the natural impulse of
            his genius, which is nothing if not wildly eccentric; but
            there are others which display no other intention than to
            tickle the ears, without appealing to the mind.
         </p>
         
         <p>Ole Bull was wretchedly accompanied; we really felt
            for him. He tried all he could to lead the conductor by
            gesture and cue, but they were mostly at difference, and
            the band differed from both, producing confusion worse
            confounded.

         <p>The Musical Convention had its sitting this week at

            —and to exalt a few little men into falsely magnified
            positions, before a portion of the public. Why did not
            the Boston Convention stay in Boston?

         <p>Poe-lemical.—In the last number of the Broadway Journal, the
            critical and learned editor reiterates his opinion of Mr. Simms,
            whom he considers the “best novelist that this country has, upon
            the whole produced.” Mr. Poe seems to have quite an original
            and peculiar standard of judging of the merits of men and books.
            Success is the common measure of talent, not only in regard to the
            productions of literary men, but in business also, in works of art
            or of usefulness; and in all the varied pursuits of life. It is the
            victory that coolers fame on the hero, father than brave bearing,
            and manly courage on the battle-field. We are too apt to look at
            results merely, and to honor and praise the successful, rather than
            the meritorious man. In business, the millionare, into whose lap
            fortune has poured her treasures, and to whose prosperity the winds
            of heaven have seemed subservient, gains with his wealth the reputation of being wiser and shrewder than his competitors, who
            may perhaps have struggled harder, and reasoned better, and yet
            been thwarted in their efforts beyond avoidance or control. And
            in literature, also, the popular man, is the great man,—the author
            who sells best—who is most read—and oftenest quoted,—he is the
            man whom the people will honor in spite of all the critics. But
            then one class of philosophers tell us that the judgment of the million is always wrong—that the great majority of men, blinded by
            passion, and swayed by prejudice, are wholly incapable of deciding
            in matters of taste or morals, in politics or religion. On the other
            hand, there are many learned Thebans,” who as strenuously
            maintain that the voice of the multitude is the voice of truth and
            God; and that in all cases it is the duty of the minority to acquiesce in the verdict of the people. Here, we take it, is the great
            rock on which politicians, moralists, and critics split and separate.
            Leaving this primal question as undecided as it is likely to remain
            until the “World’s Convention” shall eradicate from human nature all the causes which lead to differences in the opinions of men,
            we are inclined to believe that it is above the power of any single
            critic—or of all the critics in the country combined, to convince
            the world that William Gilmore Simms is a better novelist than
            Cooper, or Brockden Brown. He is certainly less known and read
            at home and abroad. We doubt if the copy-right of all Mr.
            Simms’ collected works would bring as good a price in America
            or England, as the "Norman Leslie” of Fay, or the "Sketch
            Book” of Irving. But our surprise at Mr. Poe’s estimate is somewhat diminished, when, on turning to another article, we find him
            speaking of our old friend, “Christopher North,” as “the ignorant
            and egotistical Wilson!” and adding, that, “with the exception
            of Macaulay and Dilke, and one or two others, there is not in
            Great Britain a critic who can be fairly considered worthy the
            name!" This is indeed, “bearding the lion in his den;” and as
            Mr. Poe is preparing to publish an edition of his "Tales" in
            England, (omitting the story of the Gold Bug, we suppose,) he can
            expect but little mercy from the Amir-biting reviews of the Lockharts and Fonblanques, those bull-dogs of the English press. It is,
            however, a matter of some pride that we have, at least, one critic,
            who is brave and Quixotic enough to attack any wind-mill, either
            in Europe or America, however formidable it may appear; and
            our good wishes go with our valiant neighbor.
         </p>
         
         <p>Mr. (or Mrs.) Star suggests here first, (if we are not
            mistaken) that success is (or is not) the test of merit, and
            secondly, that it is not (or is). Are we right in this interpretation? No doubt of it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The separation of our passage about Mr. Simms from
            its context, brings about a total misrepresentation of our
            ideas.

         <p>Mr. Simms is “better known” than Brockden Brown.</p>
         
         <p>Putting the author of “Norman Leslie” by the side of
            the author of the “Sketch-Book,” is like speaking of
            “The King and I”—of Pop Emmons and Homer—of a
            Mastodon and a mouse. If we were asked which was
            the most ridiculous book ever written upon the face of
            the earth—we should answer at once, “Norman Leslie.”

            land; we leave such manoeuvres to
            those who are in the habit of bowing
            down to the Golden Calf of the British
            opinion. Our book, to be sure, has been
            re-published in England—long ago—
            but we had nothing to do with its republication, Should we ever think of
            such a thing, however, we should undoubtedly give The “Bug” a more prominent position than it even occupies at
            present. We should call the book “The
            Gold-Bug and Other Tales”—instead
            of “Tales,” as its title stands. However highly we respect Mr. Willis’ talents, we feel nothing but contempt for
            his affectations.

         faculty of memory was the following. A gentleman was mentioning his having been sent up to London from where he lived to see
         Garrick act. When he went back into the country, he was asked
         what he thought of the player and the play. “Oh!” he said, “he
         did not know; he had only seen a little man strut about the stage,
         and repeat 7956 words.” We all laughed at this, but a person in
         one corner of the room, holding one hand to his forehead, and
         seemingly mightily delighted, called out, “Ay, indeed! And
         Pray, was he found to be correct?” This was the supererogation
         of literal matter-of-fact curiosity. Jedediah Buxton’s counting the
         number of words was idle enough; but here was a fellow who
         wanted some one to count them over again to see that he was correct.“The force of dulness could no farther go!"
