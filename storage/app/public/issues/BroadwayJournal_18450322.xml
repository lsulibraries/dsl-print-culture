Eӧthen, or Traces of Travel brought Home from the East. No. 1, of Wiley
&amp; Putnam’s Library of Choice Reading.
</p>
         <p>If the days of “ cheap and nasty” literature are not ended,
<br/>we have proof before us that the day of cheap and elegant
<br/>literature has at least dawned. Eӧthen is the first of a se-
<br/>ries of reprints and original works, commenced by Wiley &amp;
<br/>Putnam, which is recommended by a novel elegance of form,
<br/>and a tempting lowness of price. It argues little for the in-
<br/>telligence of our cheap publishers, that they should have al-
<br/>lowed so attractive a work as Eӧthen to escape their hands
<br/>so long. Some of them have deluged the market with two
<br/>shilling novels of every variety, Swedish, French, and Eng-
<br/>lish, since it appeared in England, but they have not thought
<br/>it worth their while to offer it to the reading public; it shows
<br/>very plainly their own want of intelligence or their want ol
<br/>faith in the intelligence of the people, the Native Americans,
<br/>for whose benefit they publish their Countess Faustinas and
<br/>Wandering Jews. The greater part of our publishers ap-
<br/>pear to have a singular taste in books: Scotch philosophy and
<br/>French romance, watered with a pretty constant stream from
<br/>Mr. James’s pump, form the grand staple of their trade,
<br/>good English works, excepting in the shape of historical no-
<br/>vels, or novel-like histories, they carefully eschew, and were
<br/>it not for the enterprise, or liberal daring of some ofl our pub-
<br/>lishers in Broadway, we should know nothing of many of
<br/>the best books which are issued from the British press.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A gentleman asked one of the great publishers a few
<br/>months since why they did not publish Dr. Arnold s life and
<br/>correspondence ? " Would you ruin us?” replied the saga-
<br/>cious book-dealer with a stare. But the Appletons have
<br/>since done the public the service to publish this excellent
<br/>Work, and have risked the chance of ruin. Legally speak-
<br/>ing, book-publishers have an unquestionable right to put
<br/>forth only such books as they like, as a baker has an unques-
<br/>tionable right to sell nothing but sour bread, and we have no
<br/>doubt that there are people all ready to snub us up, for pre-
<br/>tending to insinuate that anybody, but especially publishers
<br/>of books, should be called to account fordoing what the law
<br/>allows. We submit to the snub, merely begging the privi-
<br/>lege of hinting that there are two kinds of law, the law of
<br/>God, and the law of man, and that it is possible to break one
<br/>while you observe the other.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Eӧthen is a reprint of the most brilliant book of travels that
<br/>has appeared in England since the time of Childe Harold.
<br/>Teeming, as the English press does, with works on the
<br/>East, the superior brilliancy of Eӧthen has eclipsed them all.
<br/>The author's name is not given, but he is known, as a mat-
<br/>ter of course, at home. The great marvel of his book is that 
<br/>it should hare remained so long unpublished, and that the,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>master of so fine a style and so lively an imagination should
<br/>have kept his peace until now. It was nine years after his
<br/>return from the East before his book was published ; our
<br/>travellers begin to publish the day after they leave home,
<br/>and give us their sketches as they proceed.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Eӧthen begins at Emlin. If the author did not speak as a
<br/>man, we should think from the ease, the grace, the rapidity
<br/>of the style, that Eӧthen was the work of a woman, a better
<br/>sort of Mrs. Gore or George Sand.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There is a vein of infidelity running through the book, but
<br/>it is infidelity to conventionalisms and not to pure faith ; it
<br/>may frighten the timid or offend straight-laced moralists, but
<br/>it will do no harm to the innocent and pure minded. It is
<br/>just the work required to put into the hands of those who
<br/>have overburdened their memories with the lifeless statistics
<br/>of other travellers in the East. It puts life into the mum-
<br/>mies that have been brought to us from the Orient, and puts
<br/>words into the mouths of the mummies from whom we have
<br/>been trying to gather knowledge of a country that we can-
<br/>not visit. It is, indeed, what its name implies, the East, and
<br/>we lay down the book half persuaded that we have in reali-
<br/>ty been mingling with the Osmanli and the Arab of the de-
<br/>sert.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Our limits will permit us to make but a few short extracts
<br/>which will give an idea of the author’s liveliness of fancy and
<br/>elegance of style.</p>
         <p>THE DELIGHTS OF FREEDOM.
</p>
         <p>“ The course of the Jordan is from the north to the south and in
<br/>that direction, with very little of devious winding, it carries the shin-
<br/>ing waters of Galilee straight down into the solitudes of the Dead Sea"
<br/>Speaking roughly; the river in that meridian, is a boundary between
<br/>the people living under roofs, and the tented tribes that wander on the
<br/>farther side. And so, as I went down in my way from Tiberias to-
<br/>wards Jerusalem, along the western bank of the stream, my thinking
<br/>all propended to the ancient world of herdsmen, and warriors that
<br/>lay so close over my bridle arm.</p>
         <p>	“ If a man, and an Englishman, be not bom of his mother with a
</p>
         <p>natural Chiffney-bit in his mouth, there comes to him a time for loath-
<br/>ing the wearisome ways of society—a time for not liking tamed peo-
<br/>ple—a time for not dancing quadrilles—not sitting in pews—a time
<br/>for pretending that Milton, and Shelley, and all sorts of mere dead
<br/>people, w re greater in death than the first Lord of the Treasury—a
<br/>time in short for scoffing and railing—for speaking lightly of the very
<br/>opera, and all our most cherished institutions. It is from nineteen to
<br/>two or three and twenty perhaps, that this war of the man against
<br/>men is like to be waged most sullenly. You are yet in this smiling
<br/>England, but you find yourself wending away to the dark sides of her
<br/>mountains,—climbing the dizzy crags,—exulting in the fellowship of
<br/>mists and clouds, and watching the storms how they gather, or prov.
<br/>ing the mettle of your mare upon the broad and dreary downs, because"
<br/>that you feel congenially with the yet unparcelled earth. A little
<br/>while you are free, and unlabelled, like the ground that you compass
<br/>but Civilisation Is coming, and coming r you, and your much loved
<br/>waste lands will be surely enclosed, and sooner, or later, you will be
<br/>brought down to a state of utter usefulness—the ground will be curious-
<br/>ly sliced into acres, and roods, and perches, and you, for all you sit so
<br/>smartly in your saddle, you will be caught—you will be taken up from
<br/>travel as a colt from grass, to be trained, and tired, and matched and
<br/>run. All this in time, but first come continental tours, and the moody
<br/>longing for Eastern travel; the downs and moors of England can hold
<br/>you no longer; with larger stride you burst away from these slips and
<br/>patches of free land—you thread your path through the crowds of
<br/>Europe, and at last on the banks of the Jordan, you joyfully know that
<br/>you are upon the frontier of all accustomed respectabilities. There on
<br/>the other side of the river (you can swim it with one arm), there reigns
<br/>the people that will be like to put you to death for not being a vagrant
<br/>for not being a robber, for not being armed, and houseless. There is
<br/>comfort in that—health, comfort, and strength to one who is dying</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page178"/>
from very weariness of that poor, dear, middle-aged, deserving, ac-
complished, pedantic, and pains-taking governess Europe.
• •••••••
</p>
         <p>“ The Jordan is not a perfectly accurate boundary betwixt roofs
<br/>and tents, for soon after passing the bridge I came upon a cluster of
<br/>huts. Some time afterwards the guide, upon being closely questioned
<br/>by my servants, confessed that the village which we had left behind
<br/>was the last that we should see, but he declared that he knew a spot
<br/>at which we should find an encampment of friendly Bedouins, who
<br/>would receive me with all hospitality. I had long determined not to
<br/>leave the East without seeing something of the wandering tribes, but I
<br/>had looked forward to this as a pleasure to be found in the Desert be-
<br/>tween El Arish and Egypt—I had no idea that the Bedouins on the
<br/>East of Jordan were accessible. My delight was so great at the near
<br/>prospect of bread and salt in the tent of an Arab warrior, that I
<br/>wilfully allowed my guide to mislead me; I saw that he was taking
<br/>me out of the straight route towards Jerusalem, and was drawing
<br/>me into the midst of the Bedouins, but the idea of his betraying me
<br/>seemed (I know not why) so utterly absurd, that I could not enter-
<br/>tain it for a moment: 1 fancied it possible that the fellow had taken
<br/>me out of my route in order to attempt some little mercantile en-
<br/>terprise with the tribe for which he was seeking, and I was glad of
<br/>the opportunity which 1 might thus gain of coming in contact with the
<br/>wanderers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ For the rest of the day we saw no human being ; we pushed on ea-
<br/>gerly with the hope of coming up with the Bedouins before nightfall.
<br/>Night came, and still we went on our way till about ten o’clock. Then
<br/>came the thorough darkness of the night, and the weariness of our
<br/>beasts (which had already done two good days’ journey in one) forced
<br/>us to determine on coming to a stand-still. Upon the heights to the
<br/>eastward we saw lights ; these shone from the caves on the mountain-
<br/>side, inhabited, as the Nazarene told us, by rascals of a low sort—not
<br/>real Bedouins—men whom we might frighten into harmlessness, but
<br/>from whom there was no willing hospitality to be expected.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ We heard at a little distance the brawling of a rivulet, and on the
<br/>banks of this it was determined to establish our bivouac ; we soon
<br/>found the stream, and following its course for a few yards, came to a
<br/>spot which was thought to be fit for our purpose. It was a sharply
<br/>cold night in February, and when I dismounted, I found myself stand-
<br/>ing upon some wet rank herbage, that promised ill for the comfort of
<br/>our resting-place. I had bad hopes of a fire, for the pitchy darkness
<br/>of the night was a great obstacle to a successful search for fuel, and
<br/>besides, the boughs of trees or bushes would be so full of sap in this
<br/>early spring, that they would not be easily persuaded to burn. How-
<br/>ever, we were not likely to submit to a dark and cold bivouac without
<br/>an effort, and my fellows groped forward through the darkness, till
<br/>after advancing a few paces, they were happily stopped by a complete
<br/>barrier of dead prickly bushes. Before our swords could be drawn to
<br/>reap this glorious harvest, it was found, to our surprise, that the pre-
<br/>cious fuel was already hewn, and strewed along the ground in a thick
<br/>mass. A spot fit for the fire was found with some difficulty, for the
<br/>earth was moist, and the grass high and rank. At last there was a
<br/>clicking of flint and steely and presently there stood out from darkness
<br/>one of the tawny faces of my muleteers, bent down to near the ground,
<br/>and suddenly lit up by the glowing of the spark, which he courted
<br/>with a careful breath. Before long there was a particle of dry fibre,
<br/>or leaf, that kindled to a tiny flame ; then another was lit from that,
<br/>and then another. Then small, crisp twigs, little bigger than bodkins,
<br/>were laid athwart the growing fire. The swelling checks of the mule-
<br/>teer laid level with the earth, blew tenderly at first, and then more
<br/>boldly upon the young flame, which was daintily nursed and fed,
<br/>and fed more plentifully when it gained good strength. At last a
<br/>whole armful of dry bushes was piled up over the fire, and presently
<br/>with loud, cheery cracking and crackling, a royal tall blaze shot up
<br/>from the earth, and showed me once more the shapes and faces of my
<br/>men, and the dim outlines of the horses and mules that stood grazing
<br/>hard by.”</p>
         <p>A TEMPTATION TO COMMIT MURDER.
</p>
         <p>" And now it was, if I remember rightly, that Dthemetri submitted
<br/>to me a plan for putting to death the Nazarene, whose misguidance had
<br/>been the cause of our difficulties. There was something fascinating
<br/>in the suggestion, for the slaying of the guide was of course easy
<br/>enough, and would look like an act of what politicians call “ vigor. ’
<br/>If it were only to become known to my friends in England that 1 had
<br/>calmly killed a fellow creature for taking me out of my way, I might
<br/>remain perfectly quiet and tranquil for all the rest of my days, quite
<br/>free from the danger of being considered “ slow;" I might ever alter
<br/>live upon my reputation like “ single-speech Hamilton ’’ in the last
<br/>century, or “ single-sin--” in this, without being obliged to take</p>
         <p/>
         <p>the trouble of doing any more harm in the world. This was a great
<br/>temptation to an indolent person, but the motive was not strengthened
<br/>by any sincere feeling of auger with the Nazarene : whilst the ques-
<br/>tion of his life and death was being debated, he was riding in front of
<br/>our party, and there was something in the anxious writhing of his sup-
<br/>ple limbs that seemed to express a sense of bis false position, and
<br/>struck me as highly comic; I had no crotchet at that lime against the
<br/>punishment of the death, but I was unused to blood, and the proposed
<br/>victim looked so thoroughly capable of enjoying life (if he could only
<br/>get to the other side of the river), that I thought it would be hard for
<br/>him to die, merely in order to give me a character for energy. Act-
<br/>ing on the result of these considerations, and reserving to mysell a
<br/>free and unfettered discretion to have the poor villain shot at any fu-
<br/>ture moment, I magnanimously decided that for the present he should
<br/>live and not die.”</p>
         <p>FLEAS IN JERUSALEM.
“ Except at Jersusalem, never think of attempting to sleep in a
‘ holy city.’ Old Jews from all parts of the world go to lay their
</p>
         <p>bones upon the sacred soil, and as these people never return to their
<br/>homes, it follows that any domestic vermin which they may bring
<br/>with them are likely to become permanently resident, so that the
<br/>population is continually increasing. No recent census had been ta-
<br/>ken when I was at Tiberias, but I know that the congregation of fleas
<br/>which attended at my church alone, must have been something enor-
<br/>mous. It was a carnal, self-seeking congregation, wholly inattentive
<br/>to the service which was going on, and devoted to the one object of
<br/>having my blood. The fleas of all nations were there. The snug,
<br/>steady, importunate flea from Holywell street—the pert, jumping
<br/>‘ puce’ from hungry France—the wary, watchful 'pulse’ with his poi-
<br/>soned stiletto—the vengeful ‘ pulga’ of Castile with his ugly knife—
<br/>the German ‘ floh’ with his knife and fork—insatiate—not rising from
<br/>table—whole swarms from all the Russias, and Asiatic hordes unnum-
<br/>bered—all these were there, and all rejoiced in one great international
<br/>feast. I could no more defend myself against my enemies, than if I
<br/>had been ‘ pain a discretion’ in the hands of a French patriot, or Eng-
<br/>lish gold in the claws of a Pennsylvania Quaker. After passing a
<br/>night like this, you are glad to pick up the wretched remains of your
<br/>body, long, long before morning dawns. Your skin is scorched—your
<br/>temples throb—your lips feel withered and dried—your burning eye-
<br/>balls are screwed inwards against the brain. You have no hope but
<br/>only in the saddle, and the freshness of the morning air.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>More of the Voluminous History of the Little Longfellow
<br/>War—Mr. Poe’s Third Chapter or Reply to the Letter of
<br/>Outis.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Pray,” inquires Outis of Mr. Willis, “did you ever
<br/>think the worse of Dana because your friend John Neal
<br/>charged him with pirating upon Paul Allen, and Bryant, too
<br/>in his poem of The Dying Raven?”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I am sincerely disposed to give Outis his due, and will not
<br/>pretend to deny his happy facility in asking irrelevant ques-
<br/>tions. In the present case, we can only imagine Mr. Willis’
<br/>reply:—“ My dear Sir,” he might say, “ I certainly do not
<br/>think much the worse of Mr. Dana, because Mr. Neal char-
<br/>ged him with the piracy, hut be so kind as not to inquire
<br/>what might have been my opinion had there been any sub-
<br/>stantiation of the charge.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I quote Outis’ inquiry, however, not so much to insist upon
<br/>its singular luminousness, as to call attention to the argu-
<br/>ment embodied in the capital letters of “ The Dying Raven.”
<br/>Now, were I, in any spasm of perversity, to direct Outis’
<br/>catechetical artillery against himself, and demand of him
<br/>explicitly his reasons for causing those three words to be
<br/>printed in capitals, what in the world would he do for a
<br/>reply ? As a matter of course, for some moments, he would
<br/>be profoundly embarrassed—but, being a true man, and a
<br/>chivalrous one, as all defenders of Mr. Longfellow must be,
<br/>he could not fail, in the end, to admit that they were so
<br/>printed for the purpose of safely insinuating a charge which
<br/>not even an Outis had the impudence openly to utter. Let
<br/>us imagine his thoughts while carefully twice underscor-
<br/>ing the words. Is it impossible that they ran thus?—“ I am
<br/>perfectly well aware, to be sure, that the only conceivable
<br/>resemblance between Mr. Bryant’s poem and Mr. Poe’s poem,
<br/>lies in their common reference to a raven ; but then, what I
<br/>am writing will be seen by some who have not read Mr.
<br/>Bryant’s poem, and by many who have never heard of Mr.
<br/>Poe’s, and among these classes I shall be able to do Mr. Poe
<br/>a serious injustice and injury, by conveying the idea that
<br/>there is really sufficient similarity to warrant that charge of
<br/>plagiarism, which I, Outis, the ‘acquaintance of Mr. Long-
<br/>fellow,’ am too high-minded and too merciful to prefer.”
<br/>Now, I do not pretend to be positive that any such thoughts
<br/>as these ever entered 'he brain of Outis. Nor will I venture
<br/>to designate the whole insinuation, as a specimen of “carp-
<br/>ing littleness, too paltry for any man who values bis reputa-
<br/>tion as a gentleman;" for in the first place, the whole mat-
<br/>ter, as I have put it, is purely supposititious, and in the second,
<br/>I should furnish ground for a new insinuation of the same
<br/>character, inasmuch as I should be employing Outis’ identi-
<br/>cal words.</p>
         <p>The fact is, Outis has happened upon the idea that the
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page179"/>
         </p>
         <p>most direct method of rebutting one accusation, is to get up
<br/>another. By showing that I have committed a sin, he pro-
<br/>poses to show that Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Longfellow have
<br/>not. Leaving the underscored Dying Raven to argue its own
<br/>case, he proceeds, therefore, as follows:—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Who, for example, would wish to be guilty of the littleness of de-
<br/>tracting from the uncommon merit of that remarkable poem of this
<br/>same Mr. Poe’s, recently published in the Mirror, from the American
<br/>Review, entitled ‘ The Raven,’ by charging him with the paltriness
<br/>of imitation ? And yet, some snarling critic, who might envy the re-
<br/>putation he had not the genius to secure for himself, might refer to
<br/>the frequent, very forcible, but rather quaint repetition, in the last two
<br/>lines of many of the stanzas, as a palpable imitation of the manner of
<br/>Coleridge, in several stanzas of the Ancient Mariner. Let me put
<br/>them together.</p>
         <p>Mr. Poe says—
“ Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.
And again—
“ It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.
Mr. Coleridge says, (running two lines into one) ;
“ For all averred I had kiUed the bird, that made the breeze to blow.
'Ah, wretch!’ said they, ' the bird to slay, that made the breeze to blow.'"
And again—
“ They all averred I had killed the bird, that brought the fog and mist
‘ Twas right,’ said they, ' such birds to slay, that bring the fog and mist.
</p>
         <p>The “ rather quaint” is ingenious. Fully one-third of
<br/>whatever effect “ The Raven” has, is wrought by the quaint
<br/>ness in question—a point elaborately introduced, to accom-
<br/>plish a well-considered purpose. What idea would Outis
<br/>entertain of me, were I to speak of his defence of his friends
<br/>as very decent, very respectable, but rather meritorious ?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In the passages collated there are two points upon which
<br/>the “ snarling critic” might base his insinuation—if ever so
<br/>weak a “ snarling critic” existed. Of these two points one is
<br/>purely hypothetical—that is to say, it is disingenuously ma-
<br/>nufactured by Mr. Longfellow's acquaintance to suit his own
<br/>purposes—or perhaps the purposes of the imaginary snarling
<br/>critic. The argument of the second point is demolished by
<br/>my not only admitting it, but insisting upon it. Perhaps the
<br/>least tedious mode of refuting Outis, is to acknowledge nine
<br/>tenths of every thing he may think proper to say.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But, in the present instance what am I called upon to ac-
<br/>knowledge ? I am charged with imitating the repetition of
<br/>phrase in the two concluding lines of a stanza, and of imita-
<br/>ting this from Coleridge. But why not extend the accusation,
<br/>and insinuate that I imitate it from every body else ? for cer-
<br/>tainly there is no poet living or dead who has not put in
<br/>practice the identical effect—the well-understood effect of the
<br/>refrain. Is Outis’ argument to the end that I have no right
<br/>to this thing for the reason that all the world has ? If this
<br/>is not his argument, will he be kind enough to inform me
<br/>(at his leisure) what it is ? Or is he prepared to confess him-
<br/>self so absurdly uninformed as not to know that whatever a
<br/>poet claims on the score of original versification, is claimed
<br/>not on account of any individual rhythmical or metrical ef-
<br/>fects (for none are individually original) but solely on account
<br/>of the novelty of his combinations of old effects?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The hypothesis, or manufacture, consists in the alteration
<br/>of Coleridge’s metre, with the view of forcing it into a mere-
<br/>ly ocular similarity with my own, and thus of imposing upon
<br/>some one or two grossly ignorant readers. I give the verses
<br/>of Coleridge as they are :</p>
         <p>For all averred. I had killed the bird
That nude the breeze to blow.
Ah wretch, said they, the bird to slay,
That made the breeze to blow.
</p>
         <p>The verses beginning, “ They all averred,” etc., are arranged
<br/>in the same manner. Now I have taken it for granted that it
<br/>is Outis’ design to impose the idea of similarity between my
<br/>lines and those of Coleridge, upon some one or two grossly
<br/>ignorant individuals: at the same time, whoever attempts</p>
         <p/>
         <p>such an imposition is rendered liable at least to the suspicion
<br/>of very gross ignorance himself. The ignorance or the kna-
<br/>very are the two uncomfortable horns of his dilemma.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Let us see. Coleridge’s lines are arranged in quatrains—
<br/>mine in couplets. His first and third lines rhyme at the closes
<br/>of the second and fourth feet—mine flow continuously, with-
<br/>out rhyme. His metre, briefly defined, is alternately tetrame-
<br/>ter acatalectic, and trimeter acatalectic—mine is uniformly
<br/>octameter catalectic. It might be expected, however, that
<br/>at least the rhythm would prove to be identical—but not so.
<br/>Coleridge’s is iambic (varied in the third foot of the first line
<br/>with an anapaest)—mine is the exact converse, trochaic. The
<br/>fact is, that neither in rhythm, metre, stanza, or rhyme, is
<br/>there even a single point of approximation throughout; the
<br/>only similarity being the wickedly or sillily manufactured
<br/>one of Outis himself, appealing from the ears to the eyes of
<br/>the most uncultivated classes of the rabble. The ingenuity
<br/>and validity of the manufacture might be approached, al-
<br/>though certainly not paralleled, by an attempt to show that
<br/>blue and yellow pigments standing unmixed at separate ends
<br/>of a studio, were equivalent to green. I say “ not paralleled,”
<br/>for even the mixing of the pigments, in the case of Outis,
<br/>would be very far, as I have shown, from producing the sup-
<br/>posititious effect. Coleridge’s lines, written together, would
<br/>result in rhymed iambic heptameter acatalectic, while mine
<br/>are unrhymed trochaic octameter catalectic—differing in
<br/>every conceivable circumstance. A closer parallel than the
<br/>one I have imagined, would be the demonstration that two
<br/>axe equal to four, on the ground that, possessing two dollars,
<br/>a man will have four when he gets an additional couple—
<br/>for that the additional couple is somewhere, no one, after due
<br/>consideration, will deny.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>If Outis will now take a seat upon one of the horns of his
<br/>dilemma, I will proceed to transcribe the third variation of
<br/>the charges insinuated through the medium of the “ snarling
<br/>critic.”</p>
         <p>I have before me an anonymous poem, which I first saw some five
</p>
         <p>years ago entitled “ The Bird of the Dream.” I should like to tran-
<br/>scribe the whole—but it is too long. The author was awakened from
<br/>sleep by the song of a beautiful bird, sitting on the sill of his window
<br/>—the sweet notes had mingled with his dreams, and brought to his
<br/>remembrance, the sweeter voice of his lost “ Clare.” He says—
<br/>" And thou wert in my dream—a spirit thou didst seem—</p>
         <p>The spirit of a friend long since departed;
Oh she was fair and bright, but she left me one dark night-- 
She left me all alone, and broken-hearted.
.................................................
My dream went on, and thou went a warbling too,
Mingling the harmonies of earth and heaven ;
Till away—away—away—beyond the realms of day—
My angel Clare to my embrace was given.
.................................................
Sweet bird from realms of light, oh! come again to night,
come to my window-perch upon my chair—
Give me back again that deep impassioned strain
That tells me thou hast seen and loved my Clare.
</p>
         <p>Now I shall not charge Mr. Poe with Plagiarism—for, as I have
<br/>said, such charges are perfectly absurd. Ten to one, he never saw
<br/>this before But let us look at the “ identities'’ that may be made out
<br/>between this and “ The Raven.” First, in each case, the poet is a
<br/>broken-hearted lover. Second, that lover longs for some hereafter
<br/>communion with the departed. Third, there is a bird. Fourth, the
<br/>bird is at the poet’s window. Fifth, the bird being at the poet’s win
<br/>dow, makes a noise. Sixth, making a noise attracts the attention of</p>
         <p>the poet; who, Seventh, was half asleep dosing, dreaming. Eighth,
the poet invites the bird to come in. Ninth, a confabulation ensues.
</p>
         <p>Tenth, the bird is supposed to be a visitor from the land of spirits.
<br/>Eleventh, allusion is made to the departed. Twelfth intimation is
<br/>given that the bird knew something of the departed. Thirteenth, that
<br/>he knew her worth and loveliness. Fourteenth, the bird seems willing
<br/>to linger with the poet. Fifteenth, there is a repetition, in the second
<br/>and fourth lines of a part, and that the emphatic part, of the first and
<br/>third. Here is a round baker’s dozen (and one to spare) of identities,
<br/>to offset the dozen found between Aldrich and Hood, and that too,
<br/>without a word of rhythm, metre or stanza, which should never form a
<br/>part of such a comparison.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first point to be attended to here is the "ten to one
<br/>that I never saw it before.” Ten to one that I never did—
<br/>but Outis might have remembered that twenty to one I</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page180"/>
         </p>
         <p>should like to see it. In accusing either Mr. Aldrich or Mr.
<br/>Hood, I printed their poems together and in full. But an
<br/>anonymous gentleman rebuts my accusation by telling me
<br/>that there is a certain similarity between a poem of my own
<br/>and an anonymous poem which he has before him, and which
<br/>he would like to transcribe if it were not too long. He con-
<br/>tents himself, therefore, with giving me, from this too long
<br/>poem, three stanzas which are shown, by a series of inter-
<br/>vening asterisks, to have been culled, to suit his own purpo-
<br/>es, from different portions of the poem, but which, (again
<br/>to suit his own purposes) he places before the public in con-
<br/>secutive connexion ! The least that can be said of the whole
<br/>statement is that it is deliciously frank—but, upon the whole,
<br/>the poem will look quite as well before me, as before Outis,
<br/>whose time is too much occupied to transcribe it. I, on the
<br/>other hand, am entirely at leisure, and will transcribe and
<br/>print the whole of it with the greatest pleasure in the world
<br/>—provided always that it is not too long to refer to—too long
<br/>to have its whereabouts pointed out—as I half suspect, from
<br/>Outis’ silence on the subject, that it is.</p>
         <p/>
         <p> One thing I will take it upon myself to say, in the spirit
<br/>of prophecy :—whether the poem in question is or is not in
<br/>existence (and we have only Nobody’s word that it is) the
<br/>passages as quoted, are not in existence, except as quoted by
<br/>Outis, who in some particulars, I maintain, has falsified the
<br/>text, for the purpose of forcing a similarity, as in the case of
<br/>the verses of Coleridge.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>All this I assert in the spirit of prophecy, while we await
<br/>the forthcoming of the poem. In the meantime, we will es-
<br/>timate the “identities" with reference to the “Raven” as
<br/>collated with the passages culled by Outis—granting him
<br/>every thing he is weak enough to imagine I am in duty
<br/>bound to grant—admitting that the poem as a whole exists—
<br/>that the words and lines are ingenuously written—that the
<br/>stanzas have the connexion and sequence he gives them—
<br/>and that although he has been already found guilty of chi-
<br/>canery in one instance, he is at least entirely innocent in
<br/>this.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He has established, he says, fifteen identities, “ and that,
<br/>too, without a word of rhythm, metre, or stanza, which
<br/>should never form a part of such comparison”—by which of
<br/>course we are to understand that with the rhythm, metre,
<br/>and stanza (omitted only because they should never form a
<br/>part of such comparison) he would have succeeded in estab-
<br/>lishing eighteen. Now I insist that rhythm, metre and stan-
<br/>za should form and must form a part of the comparison, and
<br/>I will presently demonstrate what I say. I also insist there-
<br/>fore, since he could find me guilty if he would upon these
<br/>points, that guilty he must and shall find me upon the spot.
<br/>He then, distinctly, has established eighteen identities—and
<br/>I proceed to examine them one by one.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ First,’’ he says “ in each case the poet is a broken-heart-
<br/>ed lover.” Not so:—my poet has no indication of a broken
<br/>heart. On the contrary he lives triumphantly in the expec-
<br/>tation of meeting his Lenore in Aidenn, and is so indignant
<br/>with the raven for maintaining that the meeting will never
<br/>take place, as to call him a liar and order him out of the
<br/>house. Not only is my lover not a broken-hearted one—but
<br/>I have been at some pains to show that broken hearts and
<br/>matters of that kind are improperly made the subject of po-
<br/>ems. I refer to the last chapter of an article entitled “ Marg-
<br/>inalia” and published, in the last December number, I believe,
<br/>of the “ Democratic Review."</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Second,” says Outis, “ that lover longs for some hereaf-
<br/>ter communion with the bird." In my poem there is no ex-
<br/>pression of any such longing—the nearest approach to it is</p>
         <p/>
         <p>the triumphant consciousness which forms the thesis and sta-
<br/>ple of the whole. In Outis’ poem the nearest approach to
<br/>the “ longing” is contained in the lover’s request to the bird
<br/>to repeat a strain that assures him (the lover) that it (the
<br/>bird) has known the lost mistress.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Third—there is a bird, “ says Outis. So there is. Mine
<br/>however is a raven, and we may take it for granted that Out-
<br/>is’ is either a nightingale or a cockatoo.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Fourth, the bird is at the poet’s window.” As regards
<br/>my poem, true; as regards Outis’, not:—the poet only re-
<br/>quests the bird to come to the window.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Fifth, the bird being at the poet’s window, makes a
<br/>noise.” The fourth specification failing, the fifth, which de-
<br/>pends upon it, as a matter of course fails too.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Sixth, making a noise attracts the attention of the poet.”
<br/>The fifth specification failing, the sixth, which depends up-
<br/>on it, fails likewise, and as a matter of course, as before.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Seventh, [the poet] was half asleep, dozing, dreaming.”
<br/>False altogether: only my poet was “napping,” and this in
<br/>the commencement of the poem, which is occupied with re-
<br/>alities and waking action. Outis’ poet is fast asleep and
<br/>dreams every thing.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Eighth, the poet invites the bird to come in." Another
<br/>palpable failure. Outis’ poet indeed asked his bird in; but
<br/>my raven walked in without any invitation.</p>
         <p>“ Ninth—a confabulation ensues." As regards my poem,
true; but there is not a word of any confabulation in Outis'.
</p>
         <p>“ Tenth—the bird is supposed to be a visiter from the land
<br/>of spirits.” As regards Outis’ poem, this is true only if we
<br/>give a wide interpretation to the phrase “ realms of light.”
<br/>In my poem the bird is not only not from the world of spirits,
<br/>but I have specifically conveyed the idea of his having es-
<br/>caped from “ some unhappy master”, of whom he had caught
<br/>the word “ Nevermore”—in the concluding stanza, it is true,
<br/>I suddenly convert him into an allegorical emblem or perso-
<br/>nification of Mournful Remembrance, out of the shadow of
<br/>which the poet is “ lifted nevermore."</p>
         <p>“ Eleventh—allusion is made to the departed.” Admit-
ted.
</p>
         <p>“ Twelfth—intimation is given that the bird knew some-
<br/>thing of the departed.” True as regards Outis’ poem only.
<br/>No such intimation is given in mine.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Thirteenth—that he knew her worth and loveliness.”
<br/>Again—true only as regards Outis’ poem. It should be ob-
<br/>served here that I have disproved the twelfth and thirteenth
<br/>specifications purely for form’s sake:—they are nothing more
<br/>than disingenuous repetitions of the eleventh. The “ allu-
<br/>sion to the departed” is the “ intimation,” and the intimation
<br/>is that he knew her worth and loveliness.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Fourteenth—the bird seems willing to linger with the
<br/>poet.” True only as regards my poem—in Outis’ (as quoted)
<br/>there is nothing of the kind.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Fifteenth—there is a repetition, in the second and fourth
<br/>lines, of a part, and that the emphatic part, of the first and
<br/>third." What is here asserted is true only of the first stanza
<br/>quoted by Outis, and of the commencement of the third.
<br/>There is nothing of it in the second, In my poem there is
<br/>nothing of it at all, with the exception of the repetition in
<br/>the refrain, occurring at the fifth line of my stanza of six. I
<br/>quote a stanza—by way of rendering every thing perfectly
<br/>intelligible, and affording Outis his much coveted “ fair
<br/>play”:</p>
         <p>“ Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend !” I shrieked,
upstarting—
“ Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian
shore !
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken '
<div class="pagebreak" id="#page181"/>
         </p>
         <p>Leave my loneliness unbroken !—quit the bust above my door!
<br/>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off
<br/>my door!”</p>
         <p>Quoth the raven “ Nevermore.”
Sixteenth—concerns the rhythm. Outis’ is iambic—mine
the exact converse, trochaic.
</p>
         <p>Seventeenth—regards the metre. Outis’ is hexameter al-
<br/>ternating with pentameter, both acatalectic.* Mine is octa-
<br/>meter acatalectic, alternating with heptameter catalectic re-
<br/>peated in the refrain of the fifth verse, and terminating with
<br/>tetrameter catalectic.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Eighteenth and last has respect to the stanza—that is to
<br/>say, to the general arrangement of the metre into masses.
<br/>Of Outis’ I need only say that it is a very common and cer-
<br/>tainly a very stupid one. My own has at least the merit of
<br/>being my own. No writer living or dead has ever employed
<br/>anything resembling it. The innumerable specific differences
<br/>between it and that of Outis it would be a tedious matter to
<br/>point out—but a far less difficult matter than to designate
<br/>one individual point of similarity.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And now what are we to think of the eighteen identities of
<br/>Outis—the fifteen that he establishes and the three that he
<br/>could establish if he would—that is to say, if he could only
<br/>bring himself to be so unmerciful ?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Of the whole eighteen, sixteen have shown themselves to
<br/>be lamentable failures—having no more substantial basis
<br/>than sheer misrepresentation “ too paltry for any man who
<br/>values his reputation as a gentleman and a scholar,” and
<br/>depending altogether for effect upon the chances that nobody
<br/>would take the trouble to investigate their falsehood or their
<br/>truth.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Two—the third and the eleventh—are sustained : and these
<br/>two show that in both poems there is “ an allusion to the de-
<br/>parted,” and that in both poems there is ‘‘a bird.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first idea which suggests itself at this point is, whe-
<br/>ther not to have a bird and not to have an allusion to a de-
<br/>ceased mistress, would not be the truer features of distinc-
<br/>tiveness after all—whether two poems which have not these
<br/>items might not be more rationally charged with similarity
<br/>than any two poems which have.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But having thus disproved all the identities of Outis (for
<br/>any one comprehending the principle of proof in such cases
<br/>will admit that two only, are in effect just nothing at all) I
<br/>am quite ready, by way again of affording him “ fair play,”
<br/>to expunge every thing that has been said on the subject, and
<br/>proceed as if every one of these eighteen identities were in
<br/>the first bloom and deepest blush of a demonstration.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I might grant them as demonstrated, to be sure, on the
<br/>ground which I have already touched—that to prove me or
<br/>any body else an imitator is no mode of showing that Mr. Al-
<br/>drich or Mr. Longfellow is not. But I might safely admit
<br/>them on another and equally substantial consideration which
<br/>seems to have been overlooked by the zeal of Outis altoge-
<br/>ther. He has clearly forgotten that the mere number of such
<br/>coincidences proves nothing, because at any moment we can
<br/>oblige it to prove too much. It is the easiest thing imagin-
<br/>able to suggest—and even to do that which Outis has failed
<br/>to doing—to demonstrate a practically infinite series of iden-
<br/>tities between any two compositions in the world—but it by
<br/>no means follows that all compositions in the world have a
<br/>similarity one with the other, in any comprehensible sense</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This it as accurate a description at can be given of the alterna-
<br/>ting (of the second and fourth) lines in few words. The fact is, they
<br/>are indescribable without more trouble than they art worth—and
<br/>seem to me either to hare been written by some one ignorant of the
<br/>principles of verse, or to be misquoted. The line, however,</p>
         <p>"That tells me thou hast seen and loved my Clare,"
answers the description I have given of the alternating verses, and
was no doubt the general intention for all of them.
</p>
         <p>of the term. I mean to say that regard must be had not only
<br/>to the number of the coincidences, but to the peculiarity of
<br/>each—this peculiarity growing less and less necessary, and
<br/>the effect of number more and more important, in a ratio
<br/>prodigiously accumulative, as the investigation progresses.
<br/>And again—regard must be had not only to the number and
<br/>peculiarity of the coincidences, but to the antagonistic differ-
<br/>ences, if any, which surround them—and very especially to
<br/>the space over which the coincidences are spread, and the
<br/>number or paucity of the events, or incidents, from among
<br/>which the coincidences are selected. When Outis, for ex-
<br/>ample, picks out his eighteen coincidences (which I am now
<br/>granting as sustained) from a poem so long as The Raven,
<br/>in collation with a poem not forthcoming, and which may
<br/>therefore, for anything anybody knows to the contrary, be as
<br/>long as an infinite flock of ravens, he is merely putting him-
<br/>self to unnecessary trouble in getting together phantoms of
<br/>arguments that can have no substance wherewith to aid his
<br/>demonstration, until the ascertained extent of the unknown
<br/>poem from which they are culled, affords them a purpose and
<br/>a palpability. Can any man doubt that between The Iliad
<br/>and the Paradise Lost there might be established even a
<br/>thousand very idiosyncratic identities ?—and yet is any man
<br/>fool enough to maintain that the Iliad is the original of the
<br/>Paradise Lost ?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But how is it in the case of Messieurs Aldrich and Hood ?
<br/>The poems here are both remarkably brief—and as I have
<br/>every intention to do justice, and no other intention in the
<br/>world, I shall be pardoned for collating them once again.
<br/>Mr. Hood’s poem runs thus:</p>
         <p>THE DEATH-BED.
We watched her breathing through the night,
Her breathing soft and low,
As in her breast the ware of life
Kept heaving to and fro.
So silently we seemed to speak,
So slowly moved about,
As we had lent her half our powers
To eke her being out.
Our very hope belied our fears;
Our fears our hope belied ;
We thought her dying when she slept,
And sleeping when she died.
But when the morn came dim and sad,
And chill with early showers,
Her quiet eyelids closed—she had
Another mom than ours.
Mr. Aldrich’s poem is as follows:
a death-bed.
Her sufferings ended with the day,
Yet lived she at its close,
And breathed the long, long night away,
In statue-like repose;
Bul when the sun in all its state
Illumed the eastern skies,
She passed through Glory’s morning gate,
And walked in Paradise.
</p>
         <p>Now, let it be understood that I am entirely uninformed
<br/>as to which of these two poems was first published. And so
<br/>little has the question of priority to do with my thesis, that
<br/>I shall not put myself to the trouble of inquiring. What I
<br/>maintain is, that there are sufficient grounds for belief that
<br/>the one is plagiarised from the other :—who is the original
<br/>and who is the plagiarist, are points 1 leave to be settled by
<br/>any one who thinks the matter of sufficient consequence to
<br/>give it his attention.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But the man who shall deny the plagiarism abstractly
<br/>—what is it that he calls upon us to believe ? First—that
<br/>two poets, in remote parts of the world, conceived the idea
<br/>of composing a poem on the subject of Death. Of course,
<br/>there is nothing remarkable in this. Death is a naturally
<br/>poetic theme, and suggests itself by a seeming spontaneity
<br/>to every poet in the world. But had the subject chosen by</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page182"/>
         </p>
         <p>the two widely separated poets, been even strikingly pecu-
<br/>liar—had it been, for example, a porcupine, a piece of ginger-
<br/>bread, or anything unlikely to be made the subject of a poem,
<br/>still no sensible person would have insisted upon the single
<br/>coincidence as any thing beyond a single coincidence. We
<br/>have no difficulty, therefore, in believing what, so far, we
<br/>are called upon to believe.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Secondly, we must credit that the two poets concluded to
<br/>write not only on death, but on the death of a woman. Here
<br/>the mind, observing the two identities, reverts to their pecu-
<br/>liarity or non-peculiarity, and finding no peculiarity—admit-
<br/>ting that the death of a woman is a naturally suggested poe-
<br/>tic subject—has no difficulty also in admitting the two coin-
<br/>cidences—as such and nothing beyond.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Thirdly, we are called upon to believe that the two poets
<br/>not only concluded to write upon death and upon the death
<br/>of a woman, but that, from the innumerable phases of death,
<br/>the phase of tranquility was happened upon by each. Here
<br/>the intellect commences a slight rebellion, but it is quieted
<br/>by the admission partly of the spontaneity with which such
<br/>an idea might arise, and partly of the possibility of the coin-
<br/>cidences, independently of the consideration of spontaneity.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fourthly—we are required to believe that the two poets
<br/>happened not only upon death—the death of a woman—and
<br/>the tranquil death of a woman—but upon the idea of repre-
<br/>senting this woman as lying tranquilly throughout the whole
<br/>night, in spite of the infinity of different durations which
<br/>might have been imagined for her trance of tranquility. At
<br/>this point the reason perceives the evidence against these
<br/>coincidences, (as such and nothing more), to be increasing
<br/>in geometrical ratio. It discards all idea of spontaneity, and
<br/>if it yield credence at all, yields it altogether on the ground
<br/>of the indisputable possibility.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Fifthly—we are requested to believe that our poets happen-
<br/>ed not only upon death—upon the death of a woman—upon the
<br/>tranquil death of a woman—and upon the lying of this wo-
<br/>man tranquilly throughout the night—but, also, upon the idea
<br/>of selecting, from the innumerable phases which characterise
<br/>a tranquil death-bed, the identical one of soft breathing—em-
<br/>ploying also the identical word. Here the reason gives up the
<br/>endeavour to believe that one poem has not been suggested
<br/>by the other:—if it be a reason accustomed to deal with the
<br/>mathematical Calculus of Probabilities it has abandoned this
<br/>endeavour at the preceding stage of the investigation. The
<br/>evidence of suggestion has now become prodigiously accumu-
<br/>late. Each succeeding coincidence (however slight) is proof
<br/>not merely added, but multiplied by hundreds, and hundreds
<br/>of thousands.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Sixthly, we are called upon to believe not only that the
<br/>two poets happened upon all this, together with the idea of
<br/>the soft breathing, but also of employing the identical word
<br/>breathing, in the same line with the identical word, night.
<br/>This proposition the reason receives with a smile.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Seventhly, however, we are required to admit not only all
<br/>that has been already found inadmissible, but in addition,
<br/>that the two poets conceived the idea of representing the
<br/>death of the woman as occurring precisely at the same in-
<br/>stant, out of all the infinite instants of all time. This propo-
<br/>sition the reason receives only with a sneer.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Eighthly—we are called upon to acquiesce in the asser-
<br/>tion that not only all these improbabilities are probable, but
<br/>that in addition again, the two poets happened upon the idea
<br/>of representing the woman as stepping immediately into
<br/>Paradise:--and, ninthly, that both should not only happen
<br/>upon all this, but upon the idea of writing a peculiarly brief
<br/>poem, on so admirably suggestive a thesis :—and, tenthly,
<br/>that out of the various rhythms, that is to say variations of</p>
         <p/>
         <p>poetic feet, they should have both happened upon the iam-
<br/>bus:—and, eleventhly, that out of the absolutely infinite metres
<br/>that may be contrived from this rhythm, they should both
<br/>have hit upon the tetrameter acatalectic for the first and third
<br/>lines of a stanza:—and, twelfthly, upon the trimeter acata-
<br/>lectic for the second and fourth ; and, thirteenthly, upon an ab-
<br/>: solute identity of phrase at, fourteenthly, an absolutely
<br/>identical position, viz: upon the phrases, “But when the
<br/>mom,” &amp;c., and, “ But when the sun, &amp;c.,” occurring in
<br/>the beginning of the first line in the last stanza of each poem:
<br/>—and, fifteenthly and lastly, that out of the vast multi-
<br/>tude of appropriate titles, they should both have happened
<br/>upon one whose identity is interfered with at all, only by
<br/>the difference between the definite and indefinite article.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Now the chances that these fifteen coincidences, so pe-
<br/>culiar in character, and all occuring within the compass of
<br/>eight short lines on the one part, and sixteen on the other—
<br/>the chances, I say, that these coincidences are merely acci-
<br/>dental, may be estimated, possibly, as about one to one hun-
<br/>dred millions; and any man who reasons at all, is of course
<br/>grossly insulted in being called upon to credit them as acci-
<br/>dental.</p>

WOMAN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
</p>
         <p>We have encountered, during the past week, some half a
<br/>dozen notices of our review of Miss Fuller’s book, which
<br/>strangely misrepresent the opinions we expressed of that lady.
<br/>A writer in the Charleston Mercury, says that we snub Miss
<br/>Fuller because she is neither a wife nor a mother, and has,
<br/>therefore, no right to say what a woman should be, “ forget-
<br/>ting that nature has so arranged it, that many women cannot
<br/>be mothers, and that others prefer a single life.” We have
<br/>the best reasons in the world for not forgetting either of these
<br/>facts. But we spoke of woman, not women. Man, in the
<br/>same way, is nothing, but as a husband and a father. But
<br/>there may be good citizens who are neither; who yet, as
<br/>Lord Bacon says, “ in affection and means have married and
<br/>endowed the public.” Miss Fuller’s theme is “woman,”
<br/>not any particular classes of women, and she argues that
<br/>woman may, and should fill any of the duties which properly
<br/>belong to man, and which are wholly incompatible with the
<br/>duties of a wife and mother. Miss Fuller suggests nothing,
<br/>proposes nothing, hints at nothing, for bettering the condition
<br/>of those of her own sex, who by accident may be placed in
<br/>the unnatural condition of laborers for their own, or even
<br/>their husband’s bread. There are thousands of women in
<br/>this city, married and unmarried, mothers and childless, who
<br/>are compelled to assume the duties of man, and who do. with
<br/>feminine patience, manfully contend with their destiny, and
<br/>rule, where they should serve ; and protect those who should
<br/>protect them. But these are unfortunate, not privileged
<br/>women, who would, like Zenobia, resign the sceptre of pow-
<br/>er, and gladly become matrons, rather than remain monarchs.
<br/>The true position of woman is not a disputable point; the
<br/>universal sentiment of mankind has determined it; God him-
<br/>self has said “her desire shall be unto her husband, and he
<br/>shall rule over her.” Miss Fuller says “ no,” in very plain
<br/>terms, “ let the desire and rule be the other way,” and she in-
<br/>stances the case of the woman, who contentedly resided on a
<br/>mountain with her husband, because he found it for his in-
<br/>terest to do so,—and with sufficient distinctness, declares,
<br/>“ I would not have it so.” We did not snub Miss Fuller for
<br/>this, as the writer in the Charleston Mercury asserts, but we
<br/>are sorry for not doing so, and we repair our neglect, by tell-</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page183"/>
         </p>
         <p>ing Miss Fuller that no unmarried woman has any right to
<br/>say any thing on the subject. Let any wife, if one can be
<br/>found to say it, declare that she would not have it so. But
<br/>Miss Fuller is not a competent oracle. The writer in the
<br/>Charleston Courier is not correct in saying that Mrs. Sigour-
<br/>ney has no children. She has a son and a daughter.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There is an immense deal of nonsense afloat on the subject
<br/>of “ femality,” which can never do any harm to society at
<br/>large, because the instincts of nature and imperative neces-
<br/>sity will keep men and women in their true spheres , but it
<br/>may, and we have no doubt does produce a good deal of harm
<br/>in particular cases, by creating improper desires, and unset-
<br/>tling the quiet and content of many a well ordered family. t
<br/>is not denied that there are Abby Kellys and Lucretia Motts,
<br/>who have preached with seemingly good effect, to quiet au
<br/>diences, but it is by no means certain that these women cou
<br/>not have done greater good by an unobtrusive observance of
<br/>their duties in a different manner. We remember hearing
<br/>one of them speak at a public meeting once, where the
<br/>greater part of the assembly was composed of rather rude
<br/>men, and once or twice while she was speaking, her face
<br/>and neck blushed scarlet red ; it was nature that spoke elo-
<br/>quently in her blood, and should have urged her to desist.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Miss Fuller names Mrs. Siddons as an instance of what a
<br/>woman may effect in public; but Mrs. Siddons came before
<br/>the public only as a woman, representing always a woman,
<br/>either as a wife, a mother, or a betrothed wife.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>During the past week, a meeting of young women was
<br/>held in the Superior Court room of the City Hall, at which a
<br/>Miss Gray presided, and a Miss Graham acted as Secretary.
<br/>The object of the meeting appears to have been the consid-
<br/>eration of the means by which women may be enable to
<br/>earn their bread. We doubt the propriety of such meetings,
<br/>but they are certainly excusable, and reflect disgrace upon the
<br/>society which makes it necessary that woman should have
<br/>to resort to such means to secure an honest support.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There is one kind of employment, particularly adapted to
<br/>the habits of women, which we hope to see introduced
<br/>among them—wood engraving. It has already been one
<br/>in England and France, and we have now before us some
<br/>specimens of wood-cutting by a young woman, which would
<br/>not only compare favorably with the best specimens of this
<br/>kind of art that we have seen, but which possesses a pecu-
<br/>liar character of freedom, which we have never seen in the
<br/>work of any man. A class of young women should be im-
<br/>mediately formed, for instruction in elementary drawing,
<br/>with a view to their becoming wood engravers. It might
<br/>easily be done at a trifling expense, and we can hardly fear
<br/>that the city authorities would hesitate to lend their counte-
<br/>nance to such an undertaking. Many women, who now
<br/>support themselves with difficulty by their needle, might earn
<br/>a handsome competence as wood engravers. It is an art
<br/>which is daily growing in importance among us, and would
<br/>be employed to a much greater extent, if we had a greater
<br/>number of good artists.</p>
         <p>The American Review. No. 3. March, 1845.
</p>
         <p>This political journal contains but one political article, a very
<br/>candid and well written sketch of the twenty-eighth congress,
<br/>by Horace Greeley; it will probably be quite as acceptable
<br/>to the majority of its readers as though it contained more.
<br/>But a very small part of our individual happiness is affected
<br/>by our national politics. The majority of the people, in spite
<br/>of mass meetings and daily papers, care hardly more about
<br/>the characters of their rulers than do the subjects of the sultan,
<br/>The last election of our President is sufficient proof of this.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Those who knew Mr. Polk best gave him the fewest votes ;
<br/>at the most distant points from his own home he mustered
<br/>the greatest number of adherents. Our politics then, being
<br/>purely personal, rather than considerations of principle, can
<br/>never be made the pervading feature of a monthly or quarter-
<br/>ly, or even a weekly magazine. The Democratic Review
<br/>contains just enough of partisan writing to swear by ; it is
<br/>read solely for its literary articles. The same may be said
<br/>of the American Review, which calls itself a whig journal.
<br/>The number before us contains 108 pages, ten of which are
<br/>devoted to politics, the remainder to subjects of general inte-
<br/>rest. Among the papers is a review of the History of the
<br/>Empire, by Thiers, from Dr. Lardner ; an agreeable essay on
<br/>single speech poets by Wm. A. Jones; and a very able article
<br/>on our light-house system, from H. I. Raymond, which we re-
<br/>gard as the most important one in the magazine. The sub-
<br/>ject is very justly handled, and the improprieties of our sys-
<br/>tem forcibly exposed. There are several agreeable papers be-
<br/>sides these, and altogether the magazine takes rank among
<br/>the very first of the kind that the country has produced.</p>
         <p>The Southern Literary Messenger.
</p>
         <p>The Messenger was founded in the beginning of the year
<br/>1835, by Thomas W. White, a very worthy and energetic
<br/>printer and publisher of Richmond Va., at a period when no
<br/>journal of the kind had ever taken root south of the Potomac,
<br/>and amid loud warnings from the publisher’s friends not to
<br/>engage in the undertaking. He persevered, however, and, by
<br/>dint of much personal exertion, obtained, in the first six
<br/>months, about six or seven hundred subscribers. During this
<br/>period, no editor was regularly engaged—the proprietor de-
<br/>pending upon occasional aid from his friends. Mr. James E.
<br/>Heath and Mr. E. V. Sparhawk aided him very materially.
<br/>At the beginning of the seventh month one of the present edit-
<br/>ors of the “ Broadway Journal” made an arrangement to edit
<br/>the “ Messenger,” and by systematic exertion on the ''part of
<br/>both publisher and editor the circulation was increased by the
<br/>end of the subsequent year to nearly five thousand—a success
<br/>quite unparalleled in the history of our five dollar Magazines.
<br/>After the secession of Mr. Poe, Mr. White took the editorial
<br/>conduct upon his own shoulders and sustained it remarkably
<br/>well. At his death, about three years since, Mr. B. B. Mi-
<br/>nor, of Va., became editor and proprietor, and is still so. In
<br/>his hands the work maintains its old fame.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Messenger has always been a favorite with the peo-
<br/>ple of the South and West, who take a singular pride in its
<br/>support. Its subscribers are almost without exception the
<br/>èlite both as regards wealth and intellectual culture, of the
<br/>Southern aristocracy, and its corps of contributors are gene-
<br/>rally men who control the public opinion of the Southerners
<br/>on all topics. The influence of the work is, therefore, pro-
<br/>digious—and it has always been exerted, we sincerely be-
<br/>lieve, in behalf of the chivalrous, the tasteful and the true.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It subscription-list is by no means confined, however, to
<br/>the South and West. A great many of the most distinguish-
<br/>ed persons in the North and East are among its warmest sup-
<br/>porters Indeed there are comparatively few illustrious
<br/>American names that are not to be found upon its list. In
<br/>the aristocracy of its friends it is quite an anomaly in the lit-
<br/>erary world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr Minor is about to make some important improvements
<br/>in the work, with a view of extending the circulation among
<br/>ourselves here in the North and East, and we shall not fail
<br/>to do our part in this endeavour. The New-York agent is
<br/>Mr John Bisco, publisher of the " Broadway Journal,"  153</p>

         <p>Broadway. Any communications or subscriptions for the
<br/>Messenger, may be forwarded either to him or to Edgar A.
<br/>Poe, at the same office. The March number is just issued
<br/>and is unusually good. We shall notice it more fully here-
<br/>after.	_______</p>

         <p>Stable Economy : A Treatise on the Management of Horses, in re-
<br/>lation to stabling, grooming, feeding, watering and working. By
<br/>John Stewart, Veterinary Surgeon, author of “ Advice to Purchasers
<br/>of Horses,” and lately Professor of Veterinary Medicine in the An-
<br/>dersonian University, Glasgow. From the third English Edition,
<br/>with notes and additions, adapting it to American food and climate,
<br/>by A. B. Allen, Editor of the American Agriculturist. New York;
<br/>D. Appleton &amp; Co., 200 Broadway. 1845.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The value of this well-known work, by Stewart, on the
<br/>Management of Horses, is greatly increased for the use of
<br/>Americans, by additions from A. B. Allen. Esq., the accom-
<br/>plished editor of the American Agriculturist. Mr. Allen has
<br/>been engaged in the business of rearing and breeding horses
<br/>on his own farm for the past ten years, and in his recent trip
<br/>to England he had abundant opportunities, by personal in-
<br/>spection, of gaining much valuable information on every sub-
<br/>ject relating to the horse. He has also availed himself of all
<br/>the discoveries made by the eminent philosophers whose la-
<br/>bors in the department of agricultural chemistry during the
<br/>last five years, have thrown so much light on the properties
<br/>of food for man and beast, a subject of which Stewart had
<br/>but little knowledge.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The work is very well printed and copiously illustrated
<br/>with exceedingly neat wood cuts. Altogether it is a work of
<br/>great value, which every owner of a horse should possess.</p>

Price 25 cents.
</p>
         <p>This number of this popular work includes the History of
<br/>England from the reign of Richard Cœur de Lion to that of
<br/>Henry IV. It is well printed on good paper with clear type,
<br/>and contains more than one hundred pages.</p>
         <p>The Monthly Rose, No 3, a periodical sustained by the present and
former members of the Albany Female Academy.
</p>
         <p>A very neatly printed little Magazine of 16 pages, of the
<br/>precise quality that might be expected from its contributors ;
<br/>gentle, romantic and purely written. When the spirit of Ro-
<br/>mance shall have left every other place in the world, she will
<br/>still be found in the atmosphere of a Female Academy. The
<br/>Monthly Rose contains a pretty poem, “ The Wail of the Win-
<br/>ter Wind,” and a tale, “ the Knight Heartless," from which
<br/>we give a characteristic passage.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Hear me ! Sir Everard Martinsley ! Let the sound of thy horses’
<br/>hoofs be never more heard in Larmont Castle ! Go, I bid thee, for
<br/>thou wilt see my face no more !”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Charming days of youth and innocence, when young la-
<br/>dies can find amusement in writing and reading romantic
<br/>tales about Knights and Castles! How it is managed in the
<br/>bustling city of Albany with the scream of Steam Engines
<br/>all the time tearing away at one’s ears, we do not compre-
<br/>hend. But every thing is possible with the young and inno-
<br/>cent.	_______</p>

         <p>THOUGHTS OF A SILENT MAN.
No. 3.
</p>
         <p>I had been amusing an idle moment with Elia’s delightful
<br/>essay on “ Imperfect Sympathies,” when, as I laid down the
<br/>book, my eye fell upon the “ Correspondence between Burns
<br/>and Clarinda.” This gave rise to a train of thought respect-
<br/>ing those instructive antipathies which the mass of mankind
<br/>so readily allow, and those innate assimilations about which
<br/>they are so sceptical. Every body has some idiosyncracy
<br/>with regard to likings and dislikings. The “ non amo te Sa-
<br/>bide" of the Latin poet, in its English doggrelism of</p>
         <p>“ I do not love thee, Dr. Fell,
The reason why I cannot tell,
But only this I know full well,
I do not love thee, Dr. Fell,”
</p>
         <p>has come home to the experience of the coarsest as well as
<br/>of the finest minds. There are persons who inspire us with
<br/>an instant repugnance—persons with whom we, if pugnacious
<br/>would like to pick a quarrel; or, if in gracious mood, we
<br/>would at least like to see kicked by our next neighbour. There
<br/>are people whose souls inhabit an atmosphere so uncongenial
<br/>to our own, that we feel in their presence as if we were
<br/>breathing a sort of mephitic air, benumbing every faculty,
<br/>and smothering every impulse.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The refinements of education and cultivated society may
<br/>render this sense more painfully delicate, but it is universal
<br/>in its existence. Look at any ship’s company, for instance,
<br/>meeting perhaps for the first time in their lives, on the fore-
<br/>castle, which is to be their home during months to come, and
<br/>you will perceive sudden antipathies exhibited between cer-
<br/>tain individuals, and sudden assimilations between others for
<br/>no outward cause. It is an instinct of the soul, a recognition
<br/>of kindred or a perception of antagonistic nature.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Why is it, then, that while every body is willing to ac-
<br/>knowledge a faith in instructive dislikes, few are found as
<br/>ready to believe in instructive attachments ? If the one part
<br/>of the proposition be true, the other must be not less so. Peo-
<br/>ple seriously say, “ I don’t like Mr. such-a-one—I can’t tell
<br/>why, but I took a dislike to him the first time I ever saw
<br/>him:" and yet these same people will sneer at the notion of
<br/>“ love at first sight.” Now I do not believe that love in its
<br/>full perfectness and grand developments—love wearing the
<br/>proof-armor of friendship and fidelity—is bom thus instanta-
<br/>neously. But that there may be a sudden recognition of soul,
<br/>an instant sense of kindred affinities, a secret sympathy ex-
<br/>erting magnetic influence over two individuals, without any
<br/>decided volition on the part of either, is most undoubtedly
<br/>true. Under favorable circumstances, this instructive prefer-
<br/>ence grows into the full stature of true love; under others, it
<br/>may attain the size of friendship; and if there exist unconge-
<br/>nialities around, it may be chilled and frozen into the sem-
<br/>blance of indifference. Who that ever overcame one of these
<br/>instinctive dislikes, did not find reason at some after period,
<br/>to lament their having done so? Who that ever conquered
<br/>an instinctive preference, did not find its spectre haunting the
<br/>silent chambers of the heart, long after more reasonable
<br/>likings had left no trace of their existence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>One of the falsest of all false theories is that which denies
<br/>the existence of friendship between the sexes. “ Platonic
<br/>love," as it is called, has been so often the object of ridicule,
<br/>that one dares not now utter its name, except with a half
<br/>sneer. Yet what can be more beautiful, more elevating, than
<br/>the true doctrine of the divine Plato—of him who was the
<br/>purest and noblest of that glorious company of truth seekers,</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page185"/>
         </p>
         <p>the ancient philosophers—of him who taught that “ Beauty
<br/>is but the reflected glory of Virtue, and Love only the yearn-
<br/>ing of the Soul after that perfection of which Deity is the
<br/>ideal type.” In love, as it ordinarily exists, there is jealousy,
<br/>and exactingness, or at least, the taint, slight though it may
<br/>be, of sexual emotion. In Platonic love, or friendship, uni-
<br/>ting as it does warmth and purity, claiming mutual recogni-
<br/>tion, while it denies not separate affinities, the cravings of the
<br/>soul are fully satisfied. The terrible sense of human nature’s
<br/>degradation, which always attends the success of mere pas-
<br/>sion, and often waits upon the tenderest affection with which
<br/>passion mingles, is unknown in such a union. There can be
<br/>no enduring affection which has not among its primordial
<br/>elements much of this holy friendship, but on the contrary,
<br/>such friendship may exist, and go on advancing in fervor and
<br/>strength, without adopting a single constituent of what the
<br/>world calls Love.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Yet it is only the higher order of minds which can recog-
<br/>nise this beautiful form of human tenderness. To a low na-
<br/>ture, physical laws seem so much stronger than spiritual
<br/>bonds, that a love which rises superior to all grosser modes
<br/>of expression, is as far beyond their comprehension as it is
<br/>above their consciousness. Not that I would assert “ there
<br/>is no sex in genius;" there is sex as strongly marked in
<br/>mental as in physical organization ; but its existence refines
<br/>instead of profaning the worship of truth and love. The
<br/>happiness of men and women of genius has rarely been found
<br/>in the sentiment of love, but it has often grown up quietly
<br/>and surely beneath the fostering care of friendship. Genius
<br/>rarely chooses wisely for itself in the first outgoings of its af-
<br/>fections. It seeks the qualities which are wanting in its own
<br/>being—and, finding these, it fancies that all other qualities
<br/>essential to harmonious combination exist with them.</p>
         <p>“ Oh ask not, hope not thou too much
Of sympathy below;
Few are the hearts whence kindred streams
At the same touch will flow.”
</p>
         <p>This is the usual result of its experience. It clothes some
<br/>mere human creature with its own beautiful ideality, and
<br/>when</p>
         <p>“ Charm by charm unwinds
That robes its idol,”
</p>
         <p>it feels that not only the object of its worship was a false
<br/>divinity, but that even the religion of its own deep heart is a
<br/>weakness and an error. Of poets this is precisely true. Few
<br/>or none have found peace in the sanctuary of their hearts
<br/>while the altar blazed before the image of love. Yet how
<br/>many have been blessed when they have learned to weave
<br/>their votive garlands only for the shrine of friendship.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Whenever any exposition of the real heart of man is
<br/>brought before the public eye, there is invariably a cry raised
<br/>of the “ wickedness of human nature,” “ innate depravity,”
<br/>"immoral tendencies,” and the thousand watchwords which
<br/>people whose consciences are apt to slumber, think it neces-
<br/>sary to repeat for the awakening of their neighbors, who in</p>
         <p/>
         <p>all probability need no such rousing. The Correspondence
<br/>between Burns and Clarinda, was precisely one of those ex-
<br/>positions ; nine-tenths of its readers turned up their eyes in
<br/>holy horror, and looked upon the man as a scapegrace and
<br/>the woman as a “very naughty woman.” Yet why ? There
<br/>Was earnestness of feeling and fervid expression, such as only
<br/>a poet could utter, or a congenial nature understand ; but
<br/>where was a single passage which could justify the charge
<br/>of immorality ? Clarinda was a woman of refined mind, deli-
<br/>cate tastes, and strong affections; her husband had ill-treated
<br/>and abandoned her. Full of unappreciated tenderness of na-
<br/>ture and unappropriated sympathies, she bad been for years</p>
         <p/>
         <p>worse than widowed in heart, when she accidentally met
<br/>with Burns. What was more natural than that he—a being
<br/>whose heart, like a full cup, held by an unsteady hand, al-
<br/>ways trembled over at a breath—should have recognised a
<br/>kindred nature? What more likely than that the woman,
<br/>whose power of loving, even cruelty could not crush out,
<br/>should have found a passing joy in this pure poetic sympa-
<br/>thy. Bums had been wild and wayward.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ His pulse’s maddening play
<br/>Wild sent him pleasure’s devious way
<br/>By passion driven,</p>
         <p>And yet the light that led astray
Was light from heaven.”
</p>
         <p>He was his own true interpreter in these lines. The struggle
<br/>of his soul after something more true than the coarseness of
<br/>peasant life, or the cold conventionalism of high society, to-
<br/>gether with the fierce strivings of a strong physical nature,
<br/>led him into many an error. But who that reads his exquisite
<br/>songs can doubt his many glimpses of that higher life after
<br/>which genius so vainly soars. He who cannot see in Bums’s
<br/>intercourse with Clarinda, one of those “ better moments” in
<br/>his life, is, I think, to be pitied for his obtuseness of percep-
<br/>tion.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Shame on the man who believes that a feeling like this
<br/>could not exist without wrong! Does he believe that only
<br/>the marriage tie can sanctify such an affection ? Alas! sel-
<br/>dom does such an affection sanctify the church’s bond. Pas-
<br/>sion, prudence, pride, and a thousand similar motives may
<br/>make men marry, and then the power of habit and a strong
<br/>sense of duty assimilate them to their companions through
<br/>life. But rarely indeed does this mystic recognition of soul
<br/>precede or accompany the outward and visible of marriage.
<br/>Men look not enough into their own natures. They know
<br/>not the necessity of such a recognition, until perhaps in after
<br/>life, when the mysteries of life have been revealed to them
<br/>through suffering. Like Alciphron, the Epicurean, they go
<br/>through the Egyptian darkness and mysteries of sorrow and
<br/>sin, in search of that truth whose symbol is light.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>That this mystic recognition exists, I can no more doubt
<br/>than I can disbelieve the existence of the subtle power of
<br/>magnetism. But it cannot be theorised upon even by such a
<br/>mind as Swedenborg’s. There will never be a system of
<br/>sympathetic emotions which will satisfy those who are sus-
<br/>ceptible of their influence; and to those who are insensible
<br/>to them, all attempts to classify such impalpabilities must
<br/>seem absurd. Neither can it be materialized, as the mesme
<br/>risers of the present day would fain assert. It is purely a
<br/>spiritualism—a link in the chain which binds the soul to its
<br/>dim remembrances of pre-existence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Society has made certain wise and good laws for the main-
<br/>tenance of order. A high nature will not offend against these
<br/>laws; but neither will it allow a narrow interpretation of
<br/>them to destroy all the elemental purity of the soul. God
<br/>has given us wiser and better laws, which find a ready ac-
<br/>ceptance in the souls of his true children. The laws uttered</p>
         <p>amid the thunders of Sinai are sufficiently comprehensive_
</p>
         <p>they denounce every sin which can make man blush before
<br/>his Maker, and he who breaks none of these, will Certainly
<br/>never offend against society.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I am no believer in perfect sympathy—that is reserved to
<br/>be one of the joys of heaven—but I believe in approaches to
<br/>it, as firmly as I do in decided antipathies. And, therefore,
<br/>as I can understand how Burns might have hated an enemy
<br/>without seeking to murder him, so I can easily comprehend
<br/>how he might have loved Clarinda, deeply and fondly, with-
<br/>out degrading her by illicit passion.</p>

Original Poetry
THE DYING ONE.
TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF MATTHISON.
Welcome ! Thou art the only tear
My tired eyes shall know ;
Clearly is shadowed in thy sphere
This earth my home below.
Swiftly as mist of spring-tide flies
My dream of Life is flown,
While of the buds of Paradise
The Seraphs weave my crown.
Thou, with thy toiling, dusty crowds,
Oh Earth, afar dost flee,
While Heaven opens through the clouds
The Weary One to free;
And clearly streams the Morning Light,
A new day doth outflow,
Oh, Land ! in thee no heavy blight
My heart shall ever know.
Hark ! in the Holy Grove of Palms
The stream of Life doth roll,—
I hear the sound of angels’ psalms
Greeting a sister soul;
Upward, as with strong eagle’s wings,
To Light’s Great Source I fly;
Death ! where is now thy bitter sting !
Grave ! where thy victory ?
MARIA LOWELL.
A TALE OF LUZON.
Sits the old man in his dwelling, ’neath the lowly roof of reeds,
To himself his sorrows telling, as a hermit tells his beads,—
’Mid the hush of glowing noontide scarce a leaf stirs in the breeze,
Where it floateth, perfume-laden, lightly o’er the citron trees,
And a silver fount is flashing in the sunlight near the door,
Making music with its plashing, rippling o’er the pebbly floor.
But the old man, all unheeding, sits in loneliness apart,
Still the page of memory reading deeply traced upon his heart.
Lo, he weepeth! No one seeth where the tear adown his vest
Trickles o’er the scapulary hanging low upon his breast.
But anon he reverent bending crosses thrice his furrowed brow,
And his voice is utterance lending to his plaintive spirit now—
" Holy Mother ! Mother ! hear me !
Hear a sorrowing heart complain—
Earthly sorrow once came near thee,
Thou hast suffered mortal pain.
To the World’s polluted altars
I from holier temples turned,
And my heart, as ’twere a censer,
There before mine idol burned,
As the tree her odorous incense
Poureth ever to the sun—
I have found the God I worshipped
But a base parhelion !
Life’s bright visions all have left me
Where my hopes lie crushed and strown ;
Time of all I loved hath reft me,
And I am alone—alone !
Yet my soul, amid the ashes
Where I sit with memory,
Through the tears that cloud my lashes,
Star of Heaven ! looks up to thee !"
Now, a bird swan-white, and shaking drops like diamonds from his
plumes,
</p>
         <p>Springs from out the glancing fountain, and across the garden blooms,
<br/>Bright as ’twere a heavenly sunbeam, darteth through the open
<br/>door—</p>
         <p>Swan-white, enters like a spirit from the far Elysian shore.
Thrice the old man round he circles in a viewless, airy ring,
Then upon the rude stone table, folding down each snowy wing,
</p>
         <p>Silently the white bird perches close beside the old man’s place,
<br/>And with eyes clear, soft, and luminous, looketh in his sorrowing
<br/>face.</p>
         <p>Lo ! the sun, long past its zenith, hasteth on to other lands,
And no more the old man leaneth down his brow upon his hands,
But beneath the glowing sunset in his cottage door he stands.
None may know what words of comfort the swan-white bird could
impart,
But joy lights the old man’s visage, and sweet peace is in his heart.
MARY E. HEWITT.
NATIONAL NOMENCLATURE.
</p>
         <p>OUR attention has been called to the following resolution,
<br/>which was presented and acted upon at a late meeting of the
<br/>New York Historical Society:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Resolved, That a committee be appointed to inquire and report
<br/>whether it be not expedient that some effort, and if so, what should be
<br/>made, to give a proper name to the country.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We are glad to see from this, that intelligent minds are at
<br/>length roused to the importance of giving our country a title,
<br/>which shall distinguish it from the vast continent of which it
<br/>forms only a portion. A few individuals have long felt its
<br/>want of a proper name, but we do not recollect that any direct
<br/>effort to obtain one has been made until now.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>When thought is once given to this subject, it seems
<br/>strange that our anomalous deficiency has not been more gen-
<br/>erally observed. But at home it gives little or no inconve-
<br/>nience. We are understood when we speak of “ this country”
<br/>and “ our country.” A sense of our want is not forced upon
<br/>us until intercourse with other nations commences. Then
<br/>we discover how general an idea is attached to the words
<br/>America and American. They call up no distinct associa-
<br/>tions of locality. Speak of an American belonging to any
<br/>other part of this continent, and he is so fortunate as to have
<br/>a distinguishing appellation. He is a Canadian, a Mexi-
<br/>can, a Brazilian, a Peruvian, a Chilian,—a man that bears
<br/>his country in his name. But what are the people of our
<br/>confederacy ? To be known we must be described! We are
<br/>“ inhabitants of the United States of North America,”—a ridi-
<br/>culous, but unavoidable circumlocution, which, after all,
<br/>strictly implies only that we live in this particular portion of
<br/>the world, and not that we are native to its soil, and can, by
<br/>birthright, claim it as our country. When we think of a
<br/>Greek or Roman, it is with associations of country and histo-
<br/>ry, that at once give him character and interest. And why
<br/>should not we, too, link to our history and destiny some
<br/>word that shall be our fitting representative ? Surely there
<br/>is enough to suggest one in our land of beauty and promise,
<br/>in what we have been, and are, and hope to be.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Were a suitable name once chosen, we cannot imagine any
<br/>serious difficulty in bringing it into general use. It is our
<br/>national boast that the greatest obstacle cannot daunt us.
<br/>Here they are few and trifling. We have not to conquer any
<br/>strong attachment to an old title, nor to soothe a popular dis-
<br/>like to needed change. Let it be authorized by government,
<br/>and a year or two would suffice to carry the chosen name,
<br/>through teachers, into our numerous academies and common
<br/>schools, and into new editions of all our popular geographies.
<br/>While children would be catching it at their studies, their
<br/>parents would soon become familiar with it, through news-
<br/>papers and public documents.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The obvious want of a proper name for our country, and
<br/>the ease with which an attractive one might be brought into
<br/>general use, suggest an inquiry as to the word which we
<br/>shall adopt Columbia is a name that has often been applied
<br/>to us by poets and fourth of July orators, but is not one that
<br/>has caught the public fancy. Nor can we see any appropri-
<br/>ateness in giving the name of the great discoverer, to only a
<br/>portion of the mighty continent which he made known to the
<br/>civilized world. His fame is a common heritage, and his
<br/>name properly belongs to the whole. Another objection to
<br/>adopting it for ourselves exclusively, is that it has been al-
<br/>ready applied to a republic now unfortunately in fragments.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Washington Irving proposes the fine old Indian word Ap-
<br/>palachia. This has the great merit of significance. It brings
<br/>to mind not only that extinct race beyond whom even no In-
<br/>dian tradition can go, but also the great natural features of
<br/>our country upon which they have left the record of their</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page187"/>
         </p>
         <p>names and labors. The interest which would attach to it is
<br/>common to the Union. We have scarcely a State or Territory
<br/>in which some vestiges of the lost race do not appear.
<br/>Their expressive names cling to our mountain peaks, and
<br/>theirs are the most wonderful monuments of human skill
<br/>that rise in the midst of our prairies and valleys.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Field, the mover of the resolution in the Historical
<br/>Society, has heretofore proposed that, as a nation, we take
<br/>the name of America, and bestow Columbia upon the con-
<br/>tinent. The history of the last century is sufficient proof
<br/>that greater changes than this have been effected in the
<br/>names of kingdoms and republics. Custom would not, there-
<br/>fore, present an insurmountable obstacle. A little confusion
<br/>would naturally arise from it at first, though it could neither
<br/>be of great extent nor long continuance. The words North
<br/>and South Columbia, would express all that we now mean
<br/>by North and South America. As every country contained
<br/>in them beside our own, has its distinct appellation, they
<br/>could not long feel any inconvenience from the change. It
<br/>would scarcely be felt in any but public transactions. We
<br/>have to choose between a name for ourselves or one for the
<br/>continent. In discontinuing the present name of the conti-
<br/>nent, we change the word which is least frequently used.
<br/>Were common consent once obtained, it would evidently be
<br/>easy to accomplish this.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>America is a name most obviously appropriate to our
<br/>country. In our early existence as a people, it was virtually
<br/>given to us. We were called the American colonies; our
<br/>national legislature was the American Congress; and we
<br/>achieved our independence as Americans. It is the name
<br/>naturally applied to us in all but our foreign and official rela-
<br/>tions.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>One important consideration in this change, would be the
<br/>appropriate act of justice it would render to the great navi-
<br/>gator who has been so unworthily robbed of this slight re-
<br/>ward for his years of patient and persevering toil. It has
<br/>long been felt proper that his name should belong to at least
<br/>some portion of his discovery, but it would be far more fitting
<br/>and just, that the common land he found should in common
<br/>bear his name.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For ourselves, we care little whether Apalachia or Ameri-
<br/>ca become our national title, or what other is chosen in their
<br/>Place, if neither of these will suit the public taste, so that it
<br/>be only one that shall fall pleasantly on our ears, while it be-
<br/>comes a watchword to awaken high thoughts and purposes.
<br/>Let it be one that we shall love to see linked with that na-
<br/>tional literature which is even now springing up in our midst,
<br/>and which will become more characteristic with every suc-
<br/>cessful effort to make our country true to itself, and less imi-
<br/>tative even in so small a thing as its names.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>So far as the Committee appointed by the Historical So-
<br/>ciety under the resolution we have quoted, are concerned,
<br/>we are sure of the faithful and competent discharge of the
<br/>duty assigned them. All bring to it a hearty love of country,
<br/>a deep sense of our great want as a people, and a warm ad-
<br/>miration of those beautiful Indian names which are passing
<br/>from our hills and waters with every successive year.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The above well-written article is furnished by a correspon-
<br/>dent whose opinions we highly value. In this case, however,
<br/>We give our vote for Apalachia—first, because it is distinctive;
<br/>America is not, and can never be made so. We may legis-
<br/>late as much as we please, and assume for our country what-
<br/>ever name we think right—but to us it will be no name,
<br/>properly so called, unless we can take it away from the re-
<br/>gions which employ it at present. Now South America is
<br/>America, and will insist on remaining so. We give our vote
<br/>for Apalachia, secondly, because it is indigenous, springing
<br/>from the country itself, or from one of its most magnificent
<br/>and distinctive features—thirdly, because in employing it, we
<br/>do honor to the Aborigines, whom, hitherto, we have at all
<br/>points unmercifully despoiled, assassinated, and dishonored—
<br/>fourthly, because in itself it is musical, and of sufficient length
<br/>to have dignity and force—fifthly and lastly, because it is the
<br/>suggestion of the most deservedly eminent among all the
<br/>pioneers of American literature. It is but just that Mr. Ir-
<br/>ving should name the land, for which in Letters he first es-
<br/>tablished a name.</p>
         <p>NEW YORK GALLERY OF THE FINE ARTS.
Gentlemen—
</p>
         <p>In your article under this head, you have done some in-
<br/>justice (unintentional, no doubt) to those who have been in-
<br/>strumental in procuring the gallery for the public. The pic-
<br/>tures of which you complain, were in the collection while it
<br/>was private; those by Mr. Flagg were painted by him when
<br/>quite young, and while he was under Mr. Reed’s patronage.
<br/>They were not placed in his gallery on account of their in-
<br/>trinsic merit, but because he wished to encourage one in whom
<br/>he thought he saw talent of a high order. The family of
<br/>Mr. Reed declined selling a part of the Gallery, nor would
<br/>they sell it, except with the stipulation that it should remain
<br/>entire.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first movers in the matter discovered that there was a
<br/>feeling among Mr. Reed’s old friends, and business associates,
<br/>which would secure the purchase of the collection, and they
<br/>thought it a favorable opportunity to form the nucleus of a
<br/>permanent gallery. They have not been disappointed ; you
<br/>will admit that such a beginning is better than none—you
<br/> could not have had the Coles and Mounts, without the Flaggs.
<br/>That there should be no picture in the collection by Inman or
<br/>Page, is to be regretted, but may we not hope that some of
<br/>their liberal friends will give each an order for a picture, to
<br/>be presented to the gallery ? this is the way in which it must
<br/>increase, if at all. Most of our eminent artists, Cole, Mount,
<br/>Durand, Shegogue, Chapman, Ingham, Edmonds, have pro-
<br/>mised to paint a picture and present it to the Institution. Sev-
<br/>eral gentlemen have also engaged to give orders for the
<br/>same purpose. If a gentleman presents a picture, he will, of
<br/>course, make his own election as to who shall paint it. The
<br/>writer does not agree with you that no copy should ever be
<br/>in the gallery. Good copies may be of great service to young
<br/>artists who cannot go abroad to see the originals.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>You have made honorable mention of one gentleman, as
<br/>being the most active in securing the collection. He would,
<br/>no doubt, appreciate such an honor, but the facts are other-
<br/>wise; the plan did not originate with him. Where so many
<br/>have been active and liberal, it is invidious to mention names.
<br/>It is not important who has the most. The gallery is com-
<br/>menced, and all that is now needed to secure its extension is
<br/>liberality in purse and feeling.	S. J.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We give place to the above communication very cheerfully but it
<br/>does not allude to the chief cause of our remarks on the gallery, which
<br/>was, the absence of any regulation in the Constitution or By-Laws in
<br/>regard to the kind of works of Art to be added to it-seeing that once
<br/>the gallery becomes possessed of a work, it can never in any manner
<br/>be alienated. And the fact of there being some pictures in it of a cha-
<br/>racter which, our correspondent admits, would not entitle them to a
<br/>place in a public gallery of Art, suggested the necessity of some defi-
<br/>nite principle being fixed upon to prevent the admission of improper
<br/>works hereafter. We intended to make no invidious distinction in
<br/>naming any of the gentlemen who had been instrumental in founding
<br/>the gallery, but mentioned those to whose exertions we believed the
<br/>public to be most indebted. The paintings now belonging to the gal-
<br/>lery are hardly proper subjects for criticism, owing to the peculiar
<br/>circumstances which led to their purchase—but they are now public
<br/>property; and being called “ The New York Gallery of the Fine Arts "
<br/>strangers who are ignorant of the causes that occasioned their collec-
<br/>tion, might look upon them as a singular collection of works of Art for
<br/>the purpose at forming the nucleus of a gallery.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The artists who have volunteered to present pictures to the infant
<br/>institution, deserve the thanks of the community; and it is hoped that
<br/>there will not be wanting liberal-minded men of wealth to repay their
<br/>generosity, by giving them orders for other pictures to be placed by
<br/>their side. In this manner a gallery of American Art might be formed
<br/>which would confer renown upon our city.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>In regard to copies, we differ from our correspondent. All the prin-
<br/>cipal galleries in Europe do contain copies, it is true, but a gallery of
<br/>Art, to be really valuable, should be unique. We doubt whether an
<br/>artist can benefit himself by studying any other than original works.
<br/>What we hoped to see, when the New York gallery was first project-
<br/>ed, was the foundation of a gallery of American Art; one that we
<br/>could point to with pride, as the product of our own soil Our country
<br/>is so belittled by imitation and copyism, that we cannot bat think that
<br/>a collection of Original American works would have a beneficial effect
<br/>in other departments, and lead to self-dependence in other things of
<br/>seemingly greater importance than paintings and statues.</p>

THE FINE ARTS.
</p>
         <p>Mr. A. L. Dick, of this city, has nearly ready for publica-
<br/>tion a steel engraving of the last supper by Leonardo da Vinci,
<br/>copied from a proof impression of the engraving by Raffaelle
<br/>Morghen, which was purchased by Mr. Allen, son-in-law of
<br/>the late Luman Reed, of the widow of this celebrated engra-
<br/>ver in Italy. The engraving cost Mr. Allen two hundred
<br/>dollars. It is probably as fine an impression of this celebra-
<br/>ted work as exists, and Mr. Dick has succeeded in produ-
<br/>cing a copy which can hardly be distinguished from the ori-
<br/>ginal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The fate of this celebrated picture, the first great work of
<br/>its immortal author, and the greatest of all his productions,
<br/>forms the most curious episode in the history of Art. It was
<br/>painted in the refectory of the Convent St. Maria della
<br/>Grazia, on a wall twenty-eight feet in length ; the figures be-
<br/>ing larger than life. Sixteen years after it was finished,
<br/>Francis the First wanted to take it to Paris by removing the
<br/>wall, but of course, he could not do it, which has always
<br/>been regretted, for if he had done so the painting would have
<br/>been preserved. In 1500 an inundation happened at Milan
<br/>which overflowed the Convent and nearly effaced the colors
<br/>of the picture, and by the middle of the century they had en-
<br/>tirely faded. In 1652 a door was cut through the wall un-
<br/>der the figure of Christ which destroyed the feet. In 1726 a
<br/>bungling artist named Belotti, completed the work of de-
<br/>struction by painting over it entirely ; and in 1770 another
<br/>bungler named Mazza retouched it, leaving only three heads.
<br/>In 1796 the French army occupied the convent and used the
<br/>refectory for a stable, filling the consecrated place with hay.
<br/>Something of the painting on the wall, though not of Leonar-
<br/>do’s work, still remains and is religiously preserved. But the
<br/>cartoons of the heads, which he sketched before he execu-
<br/>ted them in the large size, still exist, as well as many other
<br/>parts of the picture which were copied by his scholars partly
<br/>under his own supervision. The Cartoons are executed in
<br/>black chalk and slightly colored ; many of them are in Eng-
<br/>land, and others in different parts of Italy. There is a Car-
<br/>toon, the original size of the picture in the Leuchtenberg
<br/>gallery at Munich, made by the Italian painter Bossi; and
<br/>there have been many attempts to reproduce the picture, the
<br/>most successful of which is the engraving of Raffaelle Mor-
<br/>ghen, which has served as a model for nearly all the copies
<br/>that have been seen in this country, and is the one which
<br/>Mr. Dick has used in producing his engraving. The picture
<br/>is too well known to need any comments, but the artist, the
<br/>great Leonardo, is not as well known as his merits should
<br/>make him. Whenever painting is alluded to the names of
<br/>Michel Angelo, Raffaelle, Titian and Correggio slip from the
<br/>tongue as if by instinct, but the name of Leonardo should
<br/>stand at the head of all painters. He was the greatest man
<br/>of his century, at least, and he combined the largest variety
<br/>of accomplishments, and the most brilliant genius, of any ar-
<br/>tist that ever lived. Any work from the mind of such a man
<br/>must always be of enduring interest, and Mr. Dick has ren-
<br/>dered the public a service by placing at their command for a
<br/>comparatively trifling consideration, a reproduction of the
<br/>greatest of all his works in the plastic arts.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Painters are now content to be only painters, or rather they
<br/>are content to be hardly that, but Leonardo was a poet, a mu-
<br/>sician, an architect, an astronomer, a sculptor, a mathemati-
<br/>tion and a natural philosopher; and he excelled in all. We
<br/>have, to be sure, in our own days a painter and a financier,
<br/>which, perhaps, is as marvelous a combination as has even
<br/>been known of opposite qualities; and in the case of Mr.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Morse we have a very ordinary painter and a very extraordi-
<br/>nary philosopher, but these cases are rare. In Boston again
<br/>they can boast of a painter, a poet, a sculptor, a musician and
<br/>a lawyer, which is doubtless the strangest combination of
<br/>all. Leonardo, Alberti, Michael Angelo and Raffaelle, were
<br/>all painters and architects. But we have produced no paint-
<br/>er-architect in modem times; although we have in our
<br/>city a most promising painter who first distinguished himself
<br/>by his architectural genius. We may have a painter-archi-
<br/>tect yet. Every architect should, indeed, be a painter, al-
<br/>though every painter need not be an architect.</p>
         <p>ARCHITECTURE.
</p>
         <p>We have lately had the pleasure of examining the plan
<br/>for Stewart’s new Store to be erected on the site of Wash-
<br/>ington Hall, in Broadway. It will occupy the whole ground,
<br/>and be devoted entirely to the business of that establishment.
<br/>In point of architectural embellishment it will form the fi-
<br/>nest and most remarkable feature of this noble street, unless
<br/>some other building of finer proportions should be put up be-
<br/>fore it is completed. The front in Broadway will be white
<br/>marble. The account given in the Mirror, some time since,
<br/>of the court yard for carriages and so forth, of course never
<br/>had an existence excepting in some Chateau en Espagne be-
<br/>longing to the Editor of that lively paper. The style of Ar-
<br/>chitecture resembles somewhat the Palladian, and makes a
<br/>nearer approach to some of the faҫades of the London Club
<br/>houses than that of any building in the city. The store will
<br/>be an ornament to the city when it is finished, and as a place
<br/>of business we believe without a parallel in the world. The
<br/>Architect is Mr. Trench, who has erected some of the finest
<br/>street fronts in the country.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We should be glad to give an engraving of this beautiful
<br/>front, but we cannot gain the consent of the Architect. There
<br/>appears to be a strange feeling of jealousy among the profes-
<br/>sion which we can hardly account for, but which we believe
<br/>to be the direct cause of the many disgraceful architectural
<br/>follies that bring reproach upon our city. Instead of that
<br/>mutual interchange of thought and commerce of opinion
<br/>which in every profession lead to improvement and discov-
<br/>eries, the Architects of our city labor with as much secrecy
<br/>as the old chemists did when they were seeking the trans-
<br/>mutation of metals; and the design for a door or a cor-
<br/>nice is locked up as carefully as though it were some new in-
<br/>vention subject to a patent. One of the evil effects of this
<br/>secrecy may be seen in the fronts of two houses now
<br/>in the course of erection in Union Square: although of
<br/>the same proportions, built of the same materials, and near-
<br/>ly of the same style, the effect of the buildings is entirely
<br/>destroyed by a want of correspondence in the enrich-
<br/>ments. The owners of the houses were desirous of building
<br/>them alike, but the architects refused to exhibit their draw-
<br/>ings and they were compelled to work regardless of each oth-
<br/>er. The two houses appear to be biting their thumbs at
<br/>each other like the houses of Capulet and Montague.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The National Academy should institute an Architectural
<br/>Department, and give a course of lectures on architectural
<br/>experience, as well as in other departments of the fine arts. If
<br/>any of our architects were men of genius they could not be
<br/>guilty of this littleness of feeling, but would do something to
<br/>infuse a proper sentiment into the whole body. Judging from
<br/>the bitterness of spirit with which architects generally as-
<br/>sail each other, we should say that they were the most jeal-
<br/>ous tribe in the world, and much more worthy of being cal-
<br/>led the genus irritabile than authors, who are as insensible to</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page189"/>
         </p>
         <p>reproof as cast iron when compared with them. The cor-
<br/>respondents and essayists of the Architects’ Journal, the Can-
<br/>diduses and Dr. Fultons, are the most waspish tribe that we
<br/>have met in print. It was the most amusing thing conceiva-
<br/>ble to read the trenchant attacks on Dickens which they used
<br/>to keep up on account of Mr. Pecksniff: though they might
<br/>quarrel among themselves, and fling brick bats and mortar at
<br/>each other’s heads, yet they all joined in the onslaught upon
<br/>Mr. Pecksniff. Every hod carrier in the United Kingdom felt
<br/>himself insulted by Dickens in making Pecksniff an architect.
<br/>And in truth we did not much blame them. They had need.
<br/>Every botch in the profession is now called a Pecksniff, and
<br/>the Pecksniffian style of architecture is as common an expres-
<br/>sion as the Palladian or any other. It was a name the pro-
<br/>fession needed, and they have it.</p>
         <p>THE CONCERT ROOM.
COMPLIMENTARY CONCERTS.
</p>
         <p>This innocent and easy method of “ raising the wind,” is
<br/>becoming quite popular. We hear of quite a number of
<br/>these charity concerts yet to come off We are not inform-
<br/>ed of the names of the lucky individuals to be so honored,
<br/>but we have no doubt that they will be found in every way
<br/>worthy of public commiseration. We are truly at a loss to
<br/>understand how any one possessing delicacy or refinement of
<br/>feeling, can accept even at the hands of his friends so very
<br/>equivocal a compliment. There is certainly no disgrace in
<br/>being poor, but there certainly is disgrace in being as poor in
<br/>heart as in pocket.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We do not mean to reflect upon any individual in these
<br/>our remarks, but we wish to impress upon our professional
<br/>brethren how much beneath, how derogatory to the general
<br/>character and standing of musicians it is, to appeal to the
<br/>public in the position of mendicants. Do we see the other
<br/>learned professions in this degrading position ? Does the
<br/>lawyer, the artist, the physician, the divine, supplicate the
<br/>commiseration of the public? No! they start in life to
<br/>struggle with the world manfully—to watch and wait, to
<br/>suffer and endure, but they scorn to blazon to the world
<br/>their wants or necessities. The like respectable and honora-
<br/>ble feeling should guide the conduct of those who follow a
<br/>profession only less honorable than those above mentioned,
<br/>because its followers, deficient in self-respect, strive not in
<br/>the least to either elevate or sustain its character. It ceases
<br/>to be a matter of wonder that society holds the musical pro-
<br/>fession in such light esteem, when we reflect upon the cha-
<br/>racter of but too many who follow it. A recklessness of pub-
<br/>lic opinion, a contempt for the wholesome forms and usages
<br/>of society, a general intemperateness of conduct, and a laxity
<br/>of principle in worldly concerns, are, we regret to say, dis-
<br/>tinguishing traits in but too many of the musical profession.
<br/>There are, of course, many bright exceptions among our mu-
<br/>sicians, but these, alas! only serve to prove the rule.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>For the failings of musicians, the public is in a measure to
<br/>blame. There is a large class of persons who make thea-
<br/>tres and music their hobbies; who glory in the society of
<br/>these artists ; who boast of their acquaintance ; who hang
<br/>round them, toady them, treat them, and in a measure force
<br/>them into habits of dissipation. This custom exists in every
<br/>degree of the profession, and if self-respect, and independent
<br/>Pride be not strong, the temptation proves too powerful to
<br/>resist. By many of the profession this society is cultivated
<br/>lor what ? why, for the sake of making a benefit! For this
<br/>paltry end, they sell character, standing, public respect and</p>
         <p/>
         <p>private esteem. By many writers, the first benefit is con-
<br/>sidered the first step to degradation of character, and fully
<br/>agreeing in the opinion, we would gladly see the system
<br/>abolished altogether.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>What is a complimentary concert, but a benefit in disguise ?
<br/>A few personal friends of the individual meet together (un-
<br/>known to said individual, of course) and form themselves in-
<br/>to a committee for the purpose of getting up a complimentary
<br/>concert to said individual. What is their next step ? Do
<br/>they immediately subscribe for tickets to fill the room for
<br/>their friend, out of their own pockets ? O no! they issue ad-
<br/>vertisements and large posting bills, to allure the public, so
<br/>that in plain truth, they (the friends) give him the compli-
<br/>ment, leaving the public to give him the benefit. Faugh ! the
<br/>whole system is rotten, and smacks of commission, agency
<br/>and connivance; and every right-minded person should dis-
<br/>countenance and condemn it!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Madame Otto and the German Society.—We have been wait-
<br/>ing in the expectation that some member of the committee of the
<br/>above Society would give a satisfactory explanation of the slur cast
<br/>upon Madame Otto, and of the reason of Signora Pico’s engagement.
<br/>Our attention was particularly called to this matter, by an able and
<br/>truthful article in the Emporium a week or two since, in which the
<br/>writer puts the question in every possible light. He remarks:</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Contrary to our expectation, we heard of no cause, no reason, why
<br/>such a course was pursued, and why German artists, who are popular
<br/>and are held in high estimation by our citizens generally, should be
<br/>put aside; why their gratuitous services should be dispensed with, or
<br/>why the funds of the Society, or rather the funds of the poor, should
<br/>be deprived of a heavy sum of money, (at least $200 or more) which
<br/>must be paid for the services of Signora Pico.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The writer then clearly sets forth the claims of Madame Otto, to at
<br/>least, the polite consideration of her countrymen, and remarks, that
<br/>the committee were bound to ask her to give her aid, even if they did
<br/>not intend to offer her a consideration for her services. We think so
<br/>too, but we also maintain, that they were bound not only to ask her,
<br/>but to pay her, at the least, glove and carriage money.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ But if we look upon the subject in another light, what right had
<br/>these gentlemen to slight the lady in the manner they have done ?
<br/>Dared they to urge their preference against public opinion, popular
<br/>favor, and the interest of the poor ? They will tell us that Signora
<br/>Pico will draw a larger audience to the Tabernacle ! We doubt it.
<br/>The great mass of persons who will visit that Concert, will be the
<br/>German and American friends of the Society, and others who go from
<br/>motives of charity. These world go, to benefit the fund, no matter
<br/>what attraction might be offered.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>All this is perfectly just and quite unexceptionable- We do not be-
<br/>lieve that Signora Pico drew twenty persons to the Concert of the So-
<br/>ciety. We do not believe in the extensive popularity of this lady; we
<br/>do not believe either in its extent or in its stability, from the simple
<br/>reason that there is not sufficient evidence of genius to warrant the
<br/>immense expenditure of literary gas which has been let off upon vari-
<br/>ous occasions of this lady’s appearance. The systematic puffing was,
<br/>however, ingeniously conceived, and ably executed. But this said gas
<br/>is expensive to manufacture, and should the material fail, the supply
<br/>will cease, and the inflated reputation collapses into nothing, leaving
<br/>only the odor that “ stinks in the nostrils,” of the judicious and right
<br/>thinking. Signora Pico needed none of this, for she is a talented and
<br/>careful artiste, and would infallibly have won the public favor unhe-
<br/>ralded and unpuffed.</p>
         <p>The writer in the Emporium, further on, very justly observes, that
</p>
         <p>"The same principle which should have induced them to engage Ma-
<br/>dame Otto should also have induced them to have had no other than a
<br/>German Director for this German Concert, as long at least as one could
<br/>be found fully capable for the task. We have every respect for Mr.
<br/>U. C. Hill both as a man and an artist, but we could have found some
<br/>Germans at least as capable as conductors, and as popular as men. Mr.
<br/>Timm a German, talented as an artist, a great favorite with every
<br/>body and ever ready to respond to the calls of charity; Mr. Wiegers,
<br/>who, at the late Philharmonic Concert proved himself one of the best
<br/>conductors we have, and a number of others. There would have been
<br/>a show of justice and nationality in patronizing their own country-
<br/>men."</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We fully coincide with the opinions here expressed. It is disgrace,
<br/>ful in the committee to have chosen any other than a German Director,
<br/>and it shows a littleness of spirit and want of national feeling in the
<br/>Germans composing the orchestra, that they did not resist the implied</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page190"/>
imputation that the city could boast of no German professor capable
of conducting such a concert.
</p>
         <p>We hear that the fact of Signora Pico being engaged, was taken as
<br/>a precedent, by many of the German instrumentalists. They naturally
<br/>said—if Signora Pico, a foreigner, in no way connected with the ob-
<br/>jects of the Society, is engaged at an expense of some hundreds of dol-
<br/>lars, to the exclusion of German vocalists, why should we be made the
<br/>catspaw of the committee, who, by the means af our gratuitous services,
<br/>can afford to remunerate an alien to our name ? And thus arguing, we
<br/>are told, that many insisted upon being paid for their assistance.</p>
         <p>MUSICAL REVIEW.
“ My Bark which o’er the tide.’’ Barcarole, from the new Opera of
the Daughter of St. Mark, composed by M. W. Balfe.
“ Erin’s Land my Home." Words by Henry Russell; Music by N.
J. Sporle.
“ Once upon a time," written by R. H. Taylor, dedicated to Mrs. J.
E. Lodge, composed by Miss Augusta Browne.
“ Tubal Cain." Written by Charles Mackay, Esq.; composed by
Henry Russell.
The above are published by W. H. Oakes, and sold by E.H. Wade,
197 Washington street, Boston.
</p>
         <p>The first on the list is one of the most popular songs from the last
<br/>new Opera by Balfe. This composer is so prolific in his powers of
<br/>production, that we scarcely feel safe in saying that such and such a
<br/>piece is from the last work by Balfe, for there may be yet another.
<br/>The Barcarole before us is a very pretty and flowing melody in G, 6-8
<br/>time. It is not for its originality—it is not for the science, that it
<br/>charms the ear, but it cannot fail to be popular with every one.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The second song is by N. J. Sporle. This is a pretty ballad, and
<br/>somewhat above the usual run of this gentleman’s compositions. The
<br/>air is easy and familiar, and the words breathe a noble and elevated
<br/>sentiment.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The next song, by Miss Augusta Browne, would be a very pretty
<br/>and pleasing song if the last twelve bars of each verse were left out.
<br/>The six bars marked con Multo Sentimento, bear no relation to those
<br/>which go before, or to those which follow after. They interrupt the
<br/>movement of the song, and offer no point of consequence sufficient to
<br/>warrant the interruption. The accompaniments show a marked im-
<br/>provement in Miss Browne’s writing, but we advise her to abolish the
<br/>arpeggio mark with which all her writings abound, for it is a vulgarity
<br/>in style, and is rarely used, except for some very visible effect, by wri-
<br/>ters of any reputation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Tubal Cain ! The only merit which Mr. Russell can claim for this
<br/>song, is the evidence of good taste in selecting such bold and pithy
<br/>words, to make his music bearable. There is not one atom of origi-
<br/>nality, nor the slightest evidence of thought in the music, but the ac-
<br/>companiments show more than usual care, and are doubtless the work
<br/>of one of the many poor and unemployed men of talent with which
<br/>London abounds.	</p>
         <p>These songs are all got out in that elegant style for which Mr.
Oakes is so justly celebrated.
MUSICAL ITEMS.
We hear that Mr. Perabeau intends producing the Lobge-
sang, of Mendelssohn, at a concert shortly.
</p>
         <p>Mr. J. A. Kyle, the talented flutist, gave a concert at New-
<br/>ark, assisted by Madame Pico and Signor Sanquirico, Miss De Luce,
<br/>and Mr. W. A. King. We regret to hear, that in spite of the liberali-
<br/>ty displayed by the Beneficiary, the room was not half filled. What
<br/>becomes of the immensely attractive power of Pico’s name?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A large number of German instrumentalists gave a concert
<br/>at Niblo’s last week. We are not acquainted with the result, as we
<br/>did not receive any tickets at our office.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Ole Bui has left New Orleans, where his success has been
<br/>doubtful. Wherever this artist goes he always squabbles with those
<br/>he engages. The chief cause of his want of success, has been laid at
<br/>the door of the poor orchestrians. His Niagara and the 8olitude of
<br/>the Prairie, have been severely handled by the New Orleans press.</p>
         <p>We expect a whole host of wandering nightingales to visit
us from the south, in the course of the next two months.
</p>
         <p>We hear nothing of the new opera house ; nor of the short
<br/>season at Palmo's with the Italians now in this city; nor of the pro-
<br/>posed managerial speculation of Signor De Begnis.</p>
         <p>The first soirée of the New York Vocal Society comes off
at the Minerva Rooms this evening.
The last Philharmonic concert takes place early in the en-
suing month.
The Misses Bramson have been very successful in Balti-
more.
</p>
         <p>The choirs of the Catholic churches in New York, have
<br/>been in a most unquiet state for the past month. Changes have taken
<br/>place in nearly all of them. St. Peter’s, St. James’, St. Joseph’s, the
<br/>Cathedral, and others, have changed organists, singers, &amp;c. &amp;c. One
<br/>or two Episcopal churches have been in the same state.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We call the attention of our readers to the advertisement of Mr.
<br/>Warner, who is, without doubt, the most successful class teacher in
<br/>the city. He has had many years’ experience, and has instructed a
<br/>vast number in this city. We can conscientiously recommend all
<br/>those anxious to study music by this system, to place themselves un-
<br/>der Mr. Warner’s instruction.</p>
         <p>MISCELLANY.
</p>
         <p>Mrs. R. S. Nichols.—Mrs. Nichols, of Cincinnati, is one of our
<br/>most imaginative and vigorous poets. We have lately fallen upon a
<br/>copy of “ An Address of the Carriers of the Cincinnati Daily Ameri-
<br/>can Republican to its Patrons, for January, 1845.” This is the com-
<br/>position of Mrs. Nichols; and although we should scarcely look for
<br/>anything very original in a New-Year’s Address, still there is a great
<br/>deal both of originality and of other high merit here. We quote at
<br/>random a stanza or two, not hoping, of course, to convey any just idea
<br/>of the skill manifested in the general conduct of the poem—that point
<br/>which is so severe a test of the artist:</p>
         <p>Bride of my youthful days, gentle and fair,
Low lies thy grave at the portals of Time !
Wrapt in thy shroud of long sunshiny air,
The hours upborne by the wings of the air,
Entombed thee in love, singing dirges sublime !
*****
Thin grew my whitened beard—moistened my eye ;
Faint was my voice’s tone—languished my heart;
Then, in my dreary age, Autumn drew nigh,
Like a sweet angel of love from the sky,
Ready to act the Samaritan’s part!
*****
Oft, when the glowing stars—footprints of God !—
Lit up the earth with a holier light,
We o’er each pleasant place falteringly trod,
Wailing the fate of the brown-fading sod
That shrunk from our steps, as if tearing a blight,
Down by a flashing rill, winding in shade,
Leaping to sunlight in gladness and mirth,
We, in a softened mood, pleasantly made
A couch, where the streamlet a monody played—
A death-song for one of the brightest of Earth !
Pale grew the berries red, close at our feet;
Wan looked the waning Moon over our head ;
Then moaned the hollow winds, winged and fleet,
And Autumn folded her white winding-sheet,
While Winter approached, and enshrouded the dead !
</p>
         <p>The rhythm here is anapӕstic—by no means an usual one with us,
<br/>and requiring much art in the handling. There are some lapses, to be
<br/>sure, in all the stanzas except the second one quoted, which is rhyth-
<br/>mically perfect. Even the lapses, however, or variations, are strictly
<br/>defensible, and show that Mrs. Nichols has, at all events, a well cul-
<br/>tivated ear.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Hudson.—We are rejoiced to learn that this new lecturer on
<br/>Shakspeare, has met with sufficient encouragement to induce him to
<br/>commence another course of lectures in New York. Not that we think
<br/>the public greatly needs enlightening on this subject, or that Mr. Hud-
<br/>son will be likely to create a new interest in Shakspeare, but because
<br/>it is encouraging to know that there is a sufficient number of people in
<br/>our community willing to patronise genius, when genius will take the
<br/>pains to make itself known. We have no doubt of there being at least
<br/>a thousand young men in our city, as fully competent to instruct, or
<br/>amuse the public, as Mr. Hudson, who will never be heard of, simply
<br/>because they have not energy enough to force themselves out of
<br/>their studies and dusty offices into the world; or because they fear
<br/>there is not intelligence enough to appreciate their talents. It
<br/>may be thought that Mr. Hudson’s very peculiar manner attracts a
<br/>great part of his audiences, but we believe that his manner keeps away
<br/>many more than it attracts. For ourselves, we wonder that anybody
<br/>can be induced to listen to him a second time; perhaps, if we had sur-
<br/>vived the first lecture that we attended, we could have gone again, but
<br/>that was impossible. Such was the peculiar effect of his drawling
<br/>enunciation upon our nerves, that after sitting fifteen minutes in the
<br/>sound of his voice, the marrow in our bones began to dissolve, our
<br/>teeth were set on edge as by the filing of a saw, and chills crept</p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page191"/>
         </p>
         <p>over us like an ague-fit; to have listened a moment longer would
<br/>have induced a paralysis, or something worse; and we did not begin
<br/>to resume our usual serenity until we had beeu jolted in an omnibus
<br/>from the Stuyvesant Institute to Bowling-green. There is a mem-
<br/>ber of Congress from Massachusetts, of the same name as Mr. Hudson,
<br/>to whom he bears a very strong resemblance in his speech and coun-
<br/>tenance. We remember having heard the Hon. Mr. Hudson make
<br/>a speech in Congress, in which he repeated two or three dozens of
<br/>times, the phrase "yallar com from Virginny,” and every time that
<br/>any body laughed, he laughed with them. His speech was a sensible
<br/>speech enough, notwithstanding the “ yallar com,” and the lectures of
<br/>his name-sake are not a whit the less valuable to those who can listen
<br/>to them, for being delivered in the worst provincial drawl that ever
<br/>wounded a human ear.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have heard Mr. Hudson (Shakspeare Hudson) called a humbug,
<br/>but a humbug he is not. He is a quack, without question ; such a
<br/>quack as Shakspeare himself was, and such a quack as every man of
<br/>genius must be, who is not a regular practitioner. It is not likely that
<br/>there is a professor of elocution in the world who would consent that
<br/>Mr. Hudson should open his mouth in public. But what are professors
<br/>of elocution to him ? he is a professor himself.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Newspaper Courtesies.—There is no class of public servants, who
<br/>owe their success to the aid of each other, more than newspaper edit-
<br/>ors ; none, who have it in their power to do each other so much harm,
<br/>or so much good. A certain editor holds the daily control of the opin-
<br/>ions of a certain circle, who look to him for information on all subjects
<br/>which they lack opportunities of becoming personally acquainted with,
<br/>themselves, and he may, by a good word, or an ill one, make or mar
<br/>the fortunes of his brethren of the press with his own readers. It is
<br/>this sense of general dependence which has led to a certain degree
<br/>of conventional courtesy among our newspaper editors, which is often
<br/>carried to the extreme of amenity, almost ridiculous, and has rendered
<br/>downright malicious abuse, sometimes called spicy writing, acceptable
<br/>in its place. We are as yet too young to regard our own censure or
<br/>applause of any particular consequence to any of our elder brethren,
<br/>but it shall be our aim, as it has been, to speak candidly of the merits
<br/>and demerits of those with whom we come in contact, and we ask for
<br/>nothing more in return. Much harm, it is confessed on all sides, has
<br/>been done to every kind of art, newspaper writing included, by the in-
<br/>discriminate puffs of the press. The public have been often grossly
<br/>wronged, and real merit insulted by such a course, which is beginning
<br/>generally to be abandoned. For ourselves, we set our faces against
<br/>all puffs, unless paid for as advertisements, and then they deceive no-
<br/>body. The time has nearly gone by, when editors were presented
<br/>with remarkable gooseberries, and baskets of very red strawberries,
<br/>as an inducement to write an article worth a dozen limes the thing pre-
<br/>sented, in glorification of the donor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Saturday Emporium.—There is an excellent weekly paper
<br/>with this title published in New York, by Ward &amp; Co., of Ann street.
<br/>It so happens we have never seen more than three numbers of it, the
<br/>last of which contained an imputation upon our editorial honesty,
<br/>which we felt bound to answer; and being struck with the generally
<br/>agreeable tone of its articles, its enormous size, and neat appearance,
<br/>we took that occasion to stale the same to our friend, the public. It
<br/>so happened also that we had just read a paragraph which has been
<br/>pretty generally circulated the last three months, informing the poor
<br/>that a sheet of brown paper would make a warmer coverlid for a be
<br/>than an ordinary rosa blanket; and it seemed to us that a poor family
<br/>could not do a better thing this cold weather, than to provide them-
<br/>selves with a paper for a sixpence, which would answer the double
<br/>purpose of a “ quilt by night, a library by day,” which we said.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It appears that the Emporium regards this as a doubtful compliment,
<br/>but it appears to us that we could not have paid it a more unequivocal
<br/>one. However, the Emporium says it prefers the calumet of peace,
<br/>to the tomahawk of war. Very good. Then put this in your pipe
<br/>and smoke it; and when you copy any thing from our columns again,
<br/>have the kindness to give us credit for it.</p>
         <p>To Readers and Correspondents.--We again thank R. H.
Shall we not soon hear from P. P. C., of Va.?
We return our warmest acknowledgments to the author of the "Tale of
Luzon"—also to our esteemed friend, M L. L.

REPUBLICATION OF THE FOREIGN MAGAZINES.
LONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WEST-
 MINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD’S MAGA-
ZINE.
</p>
         <p>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
<br/>arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on fine white paper
<br/>and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
<br/>act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
<br/>say much to their praise. As literary organs, they stand far in advance of
<br/>any works of a similar stamp now uublished, while their political complexion
<br/>is marked by a dignity, candor, and forbearance not often found in works of
<br/>a party character.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
<br/>and Radical. “ Blackwood” and the " London Quarterly” are Tory; the
<br/>“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the “ Westminster” Radical. The “For-
<br/>eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
<br/>foreign Continental Works.</p>
         <p/>

</p>
         <p>"This is a real book—not a sham. It displays a varied and comprehensive power of mind, and a genuine mastery over the first and strongest of mo-
<br/>dern languages. The author has caught the character and humor of the eastern mind as completely as Anastasius, while in his gorgeous descriptions and
<br/>power of sarcasm, he rivals Vathek. His terseness, vigor, and hold imagery, remind us of the brave old style of Fuller and of South, to which he adds a
<br/>spirit, freshness, and delicacy all his own.”—Quarterly Review.</p>

         <p>BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p>
         <p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<br/>the moat rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<br/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<br/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<br/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<br/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<br/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<br/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en
<br/>abled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-
<br/>cians.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<br/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
<br/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<br/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
<br/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<br/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<br/>names in the principal cities.</p>

         <p>From the Courier and Enquirer. July 27, 1844.
<br/>Goldsmith’s Gems or Pennmanship.—The Chirographic art is
<br/>much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, and
<br/>Mr. Goldsmith may well claim to be considered at its head. The
<br/>volume before us exhibits more taste and ingenuity, and higher proofs
<br/>of manual dexterity than we have ever seen before.</p>
         <p>From the New York Express.
</p>
         <p>Goldsmith’s Gems or Penmanship.—We have seen the original, as
<br/>executed by his own hand, and a more beautiful, and indeed a more
<br/>wonderful display of the power of that little instrument which is said
<br/>to be “ more potent than the sword,” we never witnessed before.</p>
