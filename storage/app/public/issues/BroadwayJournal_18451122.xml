            Sister Mine.
            Sister mine—Sister mine!
            Why art so dear?
            Why throbs this heart of mine,
            
         </p>
         <p>Like the strong-tendrilled vine,
            Clinging so close to thine
            When thou art near,
         </p>
         <p>Sister mine?
            Sister mine—Sister mine!
            Why art so dear?
            Chill is this heart of mine,
            Till that sweet smile of thine
            Wakes it to life divine,
            When thou art near,
            Sister mine.
            
         </p>
         <p>Sister mine—Sister mine I
            Why art so dear?
            Light is this heart of mine,
         </p>
         <p>As is the sparkling wine
            Bright in its crimson-shine,
            When thou art near,
            Sister mine.
            Sister mine—Sister mine!
            Thou art so dear
            By that wierd spell of thine,
            
         </p>
         <p>Wreathed round this heart of mine
            Till our twin spirits twine
            When thou art near,
         </p>
         <p>Sister mine !	R. H. DANA
            The Spectacles.
            
         </p>
         <p>Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the
            idea of “ love at first sight;" but those who think, not
            less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated
            its existence. Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may
            be termed ethical magnetism or magnetœsthetics, render
            it probable that the most natural, and, consequently the
            truest and most intense of the human affections, are
            those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy
            —in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the
            psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.
            The confession I am about to make will add another to
            the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of
            the position.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.
            I am still a very young man—not yet twenty-two years
            of age. My name, at present, is a very usual and rather
            plebeian one—Simpson. I say “at present;" for it is
            only lately that I have been so called—having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year, in order
            to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male
            relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator;—the
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>family, not the Christian name ; my Christian name is
            Napoleon Buonaparte—or, more properly, these are my
            first and middle appellations.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance,
            as in my true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride; beleiving that I could trace a descent from
            the immortal author of the “ Chronicles.” While on
            the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of
            my immediate predecessors. My father was a Monsieur
            Froissart, of Paris. His wife, my mother, whom he married at fifteen, was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest
            daughter of Croissart the banker ; whose wife, again,
            being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter
            of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a Mademoiselle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married ; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only
            fourteen when led to the altar. These early marriages
            are usual in France. Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent. My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson,
            by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on
            my part that, at one period, I actually hesitated about
            accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As to personal endowments I am by no means deficient.
            On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome
            face. In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is black
            and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My eyes are
            large and gray ; and although, in fact, they are weak to
            a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard
            would be suspected from their appearance. The weakness, itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and
            I have resorted to every remedy—short of wearing
            glasses. Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally
            dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them.
            I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature
            with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. An eye-glass, on the other
            hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation.
            I have hitherto managed as well as I could without
            either. But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance. I
            will content myself with saying, in addition, that my
            temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and
            that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the
            women.
         </p>
         <p>One night, last winter, I entered a box at the P——
            
         </p>
         <p>theatre, in company with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was
            an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded.
            We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page300"></div>
            which had been reserved for us, and into which, with
            some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.
            
         </p>
         <p>For two hours, my companion, who was a musical
            fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage ; and,
            in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very élite of
            the city. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was
            about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they
            were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with which I regarded this figure. It
            was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far turned towards the stage that,
            for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it but
            the form was divine—no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion, and even the term “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female gracefulness—was always a power which
            I had found it impossible to resist; but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most
            enthusiastic visions. The figure, almost all of which the
            construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached,
            without positively reaching, the majestic. Its perfect
            fulness and tournure were delicious. The head, of
            which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that
            of the Greek Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze äerienne, which put me
            in mind of the ventum textilem of Apuleius. The right
            arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled
            every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.
            Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open
            sleeves now in fashion. This extended but little below
            the elbow. Beneath it was worn an under one of some
            frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of
            rich lace which fell gracefully over the top of the hand,
            revealing only the delicate lingers, upon one of which
            sparkled a diamond ring which I at once saw was of extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist
            was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and
            which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent
            aigrette of jewels—telling, in words that could not be
            mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the
            wearer.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an
            hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and,
            during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all
            that has been said or sung concerning “love at first
            sight.” My feelings were totally different from any
            which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even
            the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness. An
            unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a
            magnetic sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not
            only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and
            feeling upon the admirable object before me. I saw—I
            felt—I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in
            love—and this even before seeing the face of the person
            beloved. So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received
            little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen,
            proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is
            the nature of the only true love—of the love at first sight
            —and so little really dependent is it upon the external
            conditions which only seem to create and control it.
         </p>
         <p>While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely
            vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused
            
         </p>
         <p>her to turn her head partially towards me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face. Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was something
            about it which disappointed me without my being able
            to tell exactly what it was. I said “disappointed,” but
            this is not altogether the word. My sentiments were at
            once quieted and exalted. They partook less of transport
            and more of calm enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose.
            This state of feeling arose, perhaps, front the Madonnalike and matronly air of the face ; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this.
            There was something else—some mystery which I could
            not develope—some expression about the countenance
            which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened
            my interest. In fact, I was just in that condition of
            mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for
            any act of extravagance. Had the lady been alone, I
            should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted
            her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by
            two companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than
            herself.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which
            I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder
            lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct
            view of her beauty. I would have removed my position
            to one nearer her own : but the crowded state of the
            theatre rendered this impossible, and the stern decrees of
            Fashion, had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of
            the opera-glass, in a case such as this, even had I been
            so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not, and
            was thus in despair.
         </p>
         <p>At length I bethought me of applying to my compan-
            ion.
            “ Talbot,” I said, “ you have an opera-glass. Let me
            have it.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“An opera-glass! no! what do you suppose I would
            be doing with an opera-glass ?" Here he turned impatiently towards the stage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “ listen to me. will you ? Do you see the stage-box?
            —there! no, the next—did you ever behold as lovely a
            woman ?"
         </p>
         <p>“ She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.
            "I wonder who she can be ?”
            
         </p>
         <p>“Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you
            know who she is? 'Not to know her argues yourself
            unknown.’ She is the celebrated Madame Lalande—the
            beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the
            whole town. Immensely wealthy, too—a widow and a
            great match—has just arrived from Paris.”
         </p>
         <p>“ Do you know her ?”
            “Yes: I have the honor.”
            “ Will you introduce me ?”
            “Assuredly; with the greatest pleasure; when shall
            it be?”
            “To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B——’s."
            “ Very good: and now do hold your tongue, if you
            can.”
            
         </p>
         <p>In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further
            question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively
            for the rest of the evening, with what was transacting
            upon the stage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In the mean time I kept my eyes riveted on Madame
            Lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a
            full front view of her face. It was exquisitely lovely—
            this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page301"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point—but still the
            unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of
            gravity, sadness, or still more properly, of weariness,
            which took something from the youth and freshness of
            the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic
            and romantic temperament, with an interest tenfold.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to
            my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on
            the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware
            of the intensity of my gaze. Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.
            She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chisselled contour of the back portion of the head. After
            some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was
            still looking, she gradually brought her face again around
            and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark
            eves fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.
            But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not
            only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eye-glass—elevated it
            —adjusted it—and then regarded me through it, intently
            and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have
            been more thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not
            offended or disgusted in the slightest degree ; although
            an action so bold in any other woman, would have been
            likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done
            with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much
            repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in
            short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible,
            and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass,
            she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of
            my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when,
            as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so
            continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space
            of several minutes--for five minutes, at the very least, I
            am sure.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which
            lor a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no
            visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was she
            dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again
            to the stage ; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to watch her unremittingly,
            although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.
            Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its
            position ; and soon I became convinced that the lady,
            while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect
            this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had
            upon my excitable mind.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an
            hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and, while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had
            reference to myself.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned towards the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed
            in the performances. At the expiration of this period,
            however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation byseeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and,
            disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey
            me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded
            my soul.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This extraordinary behaviour, by throwing me into a
            perfect fever of excitement—into an absolute delirium
            of love—served rather to embolden than disconcert me.
            In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything
            but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision
            which confronted my gaze. Watching my opportunity,
            when I thought the audience were fully engaged with
            the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakeable bow.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then
            slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if
            my rash action had been noticed—then leaned over towards the gentleman who sat by her side.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had
            committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated
            rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. I was
            greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw
            the lady merely hand the gentleman a playbill, without
            speaking ; but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—
            my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly afterwards, having again glanced furtively around,
            she allowed her bright eyes to settle fully and steadily
            upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a
            bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed
            and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my
            transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever
            man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at
            that moment. I loved. This was my first love—so I felt
            it to be. It was love supreme—indescribable. It was
            “love at first sight;" and at first sight too, it had been
            appreciated and—returned.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an
            instant ? What other construction could I possibly put
            upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful—so
            wealthy—evidently so accomplished—of so high breeding—of so lofty a position in society—in every regard so
            entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande ? Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm
            of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromisins—as uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly
            unbounded as my own ! These delicious fancies and inflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of
            the drop-curtain. The audience arose ; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting Talbot abruptly,
            I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity
            with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on ac
            count of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and
            bent my steps homewards ; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the
            hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This morrow at last came ; that is to say, a day finally
            dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience ; and
            then the hours until “ one” were snail-paced, dreary and
            innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have
            an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The
            clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I stepped into
            B——'s and enquired for Talbot.
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page302"></div>
            “ Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.
            
         </p>
         <p>“ Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—
            "let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable ; Mr. Talbot is not
            out. What do you mean ?”
         </p>
         <p>“Nothing, sir ; only Mr. Talbot is not in. That’s all.
            He rode over to S——, immediately after breakfast, and
            left word that he would not be in town again for a week.”
            
         </p>
         <p>I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored
            to reply, but my tongue refused its office. At length I
            turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the innermost
            regions of Erebus. It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was
            made. At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his
            word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street,
            propounding futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to
            every male acquaintance I met. By report she was known,
            I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been in
            town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. These
            few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or
            would not, lake the liberty of introducing me through the
            formality of a morning call. While I stood thus, in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject
            itself passed by.
         </p>
         <p>“ As I live, there she is!” cried one.
            “Surpassingly beautiful!’’ exclaimed a second.
            “ An angel upon earth !” ejaculated a third.
            
         </p>
         <p>I looked ; and, in an open carriage which approached
            us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting
            vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady
            who had occupied a portion of her box.
         </p>
         <p>“ Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the
            one of my trio who had spoken first.
            
         </p>
         <p>“Astonishingly,” said the second ; “still quite a brilliant air; but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she
            looks better than she did at Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still;—don’t you think so, Froissart?—Simpson, I mean.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>"Still!” said I, “ and why shouldn’t she be ? But
            compared with her friend she is as a rushlight to the
            evening star—a glow-worm to Antares.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Ha! ha ! ha !—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries—original ones, I mean.”
            And here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the lines—
         </p>
         <p>Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—
            A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!
            
         </p>
         <p>During this little scene, however, one thing had served
            greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by
            which I was consumed. As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by
            the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all
            hope of it, until such time as Talbot should think proper
            to return from the country. In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement ; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw
            her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every day,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>in the interim, I had enquired for Talbot at his hotel, and
            every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the
            everlasting “ Not come home yet” of his footman.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a
            condition little short of madness. Madame Lalande, I
            had been told, was a Parisian—had lately arrived from
            Paris—might she not suddenly return ?—return before
            Talbot came back—and might she not be thus lost to me
            forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since
            my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with
            a manly decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of
            the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate
            letter, in which I poured out my whole heart.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion.
            I concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I
            alluded to the romantic circumstance of our first meeting—even to the glances which had passed between us.
            I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love ;
            while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of
            devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable
            conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might
            quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my
            wordly circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer
            of my heart and of my hand.
         </p>
         <p>In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After
            what seemed the lapse of a century it came.
            
         </p>
         <p>Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear,
            I really received a letter from Madame Lalande—the
            beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.—
            Her eyes—her magnificent eyes—had not belied her noble
            heart. Like a true Frenchwoman, as she was, she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous impulses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies
            of the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She
            had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter unopened. She had even sent me, in reply,
            one penned by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus:
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle
            tong of his contree so vell as might It is only de late dat I am
            arrive, and not yet ave de opportunity for to—l’étudier.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Vid dis apologie for de maniere, I vill now say dat, hélas !—
            Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de more?
            Hélas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?
         </p>
         <p>Eugenie Lalande.
            
         </p>
         <p>This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and
            committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory. Still
            Talbot would not return. Alas! could he have formed
            even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have
            flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he came
            not. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent
            business—but would shortly return. He begged me not
            to be impatient—to moderate my transports—to read
            soothing books—to drink nothing stronger than Hock—
            and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.
            The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the
            name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed
            me a letter of presentation? I wrote again, entreating
            him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned
            by that footman, with the following endorsement in
            pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the country:
         </p>
         <p>Left S——yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—
            
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page303"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>or when be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your
            handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry —
            Yours, sincerely,	Stubbs.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the
            infernal deities both master and valet;—but there was
            little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end. Besides, after the
            correspondence which had passed between us, what act
            of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that
            ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame Lalande?
            Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of
            watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by
            a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her
            windows. Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing
            groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did
            this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took
            the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into
            the rear; and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we
            discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently
            than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in
            French. In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I
            gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature,
            and with all the eloquence I could command, besought
            her consent to an immediate marriage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from
            bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I had most imprudently made it known among my friends,
            she observed, that I desired her acquaintance—thus that
            I did not possess it—thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each
            other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would
            be improper—would be indecorous—would be outre.—
            All this she said with a charming air of naivete which
            enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. She went
            even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness—of
            imprudence. She bade me remember that I really even
            knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her
            connexions, her standing in society. She begged me, but
            with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my
            love an infatuation—a will ’o the wisp—a fancy or fantasy
            of the moment—a baseless and unstable creation rather of
            the imagination than of the heart. These things she
            uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered
            darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single
            sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I
            spoke at length, and perseveringly, of my devotion, of
            my passion—of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In conclusion, I dwelt, with a
            convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the
            course of love—that course of true love that never did
            run smooth, and thus deduced the manifest danger of
            rendering that course unnecessarily long.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor
            of her determination. She relented; but there was yet
            an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>properly considered. This was a delicate point—for a
            woman to urge, especially so ; in mentioning it, she saw
            that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings ; still, for
            me, every sacrifice should be made. She alluded to the
            topic of age. Was I aware—was I fully aware of the
            discrepancy between us ? That the age of the husband
            should surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty
            —the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper ; but she had always
            entertained the belief that the years of the wife should
            never exceed in number those of the husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently,
            alas ! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware that
            my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the
            contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my
            Eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of
            candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which
            eternally rivetted my chains. I could scarcely restrain
            the excessive transport which possessed me.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“My sweetest Eugenie,” I cried, “what is all this
            about which you are discoursing ? Your years surpass
            in some measure my own. But what then ? The customs of the world are so many conventional follies. To
            those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a
            year from an hour ? I am twenty-two, you say; granted:
            indeed you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three.
            Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have numbered no more than—can have numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that
            Madame Lalande would interrupt me by supplying
            her true age. But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and
            has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query,
            some little practical reply of her own. In the present
            instance Eugenie, who, for a few moments past, had
            seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at
            length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing
            smiles. “ Keep it for my sake—for the sake of her whom
            it too flatteringly represents. Besides, upon the back of
            the trinket, you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing
            rather dark—but you can examine it at your leisure in the
            morning. In the mean time, you shall be my escort home
            to-night. My friends are about holding a little musical
            levée. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We
            French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans,
            and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the
            character of an old acquaintance."
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.
            The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of this latter point, however, I am
            scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived ; and in American mansions of the better sort, lights
            seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In
            about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded
            solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room ; and
            this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor ; but two other rooms
            of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled,
            remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable
            shadow. This is a well conceived custom, giving the
            party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page304"></div>
            our friends over the water could not do better than im-
            mediately adopt.
            
         </p>
         <p>The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most
            delicious of my life. Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends ; and the singing
            I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private
            circle out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were
            many and of superior talents. The vocalists were chiefly
            ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length,
            upon a peremptory call for “ Madame Lalande,” she arose
            at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise
            longue upon which she had sate by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of
            the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room.
            I would have escorted her myself; but felt that, under
            the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had
            better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing
            her, sing.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The impression she produced upon the company seemed
            electrical—but the effect upon myself was something even
            more. I know not how adequately to describe it. It arose
            in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which
            I was imbued ; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of
            art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her utterance of the
            romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave the
            words “Sul mio sasso," in the Capuletti—is ringing in
            my memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice embraced three complete octaves,
            extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and,
            though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos,
            executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of
            vocal composition—ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In the finale of the Sonnambula, she
            brought about a most remarkable effect at the words—
         </p>
         <p>Ah ! non guinge uman pensiero
            Al contento ond ’io son piena.
            
         </p>
         <p>Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to
            the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the
            G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of
            two octaves.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal
            execution, she resumed her seat by my side ; when I
            expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my
            delight at her performance. Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised ; for a
            certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to
            anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself
            with any remarkable ability.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted,
            and totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the
            earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless
            attention, to every word of the narrative. I concealed
            nothing—I felt that I had a right to conceal nothing from
            her confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon
            the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but
            made full confession of those moral and even of those
            physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer
            an evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my extravagances—upon my carousals—upon
            my debts—upon my flirtations. I even went so far as to
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time,
            I had been troubled—of a chronic rheumatism—of a
            twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “ you have been surely injudicious in coming to
            confession ; for, without the confession, I take it for
            granted that no one would have accused you of the crime.
            By the by’” she continued, “ have you any recollection’’
            —and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom
            of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek
            —“ have you any recollection, mon cher ami, of this little
            ocular assistant which now depends from my neck ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical
            double eye-glass, which had so overwhelmed me with
            confusion at the opera.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Full well—alas I do I remember it,” I exclaimed,
            pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the
            glasses for my inspection. They formed a complex and
            magnificent toy, richly chased and filagreed, and gleaming
            with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could
            not help perceiving were of high value.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Eh bien! mon ami," she resumed with a certain empressement of manner that rather surprised me—“Eh bien,
            mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor
            which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You
            have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. Should
            I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand
            of you a very—a very little boon in return ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had
            nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company,
            and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. “ Name it, my beloved, my
            Eugenie, my own !—name it !— but alas it is already
            yielded ere named.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ You shall conquer then, mon ami," she said, “for the
            sake of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness
            which you have last confessed—this weakness more moral
            than physical—and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature—so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character—and which,
            if permitted farther control, will assuredly involve you,
            sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape. You
            shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads
            you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied
            denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you
            virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means
            for its relief. You will understand me to say, then, that
            I wish you to wear spectacles :—ah, hush —you have
            already consented to wear them, for my sake. You shall
            accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and
            which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of
            no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by
            a trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to
            the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat packet as an eye-glass. It is in the former mode,
            however, and habitually, that you have already consented
            to wear it for my sake."
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This request—must I confess it ?—confused me in no
            little degree. But the condition with which it was coupled
            rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of
            the question.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“It is done !” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I
            could muster at the moment. “ It is done—it is most
            cheerfully agreed. I sacrifise every feeling for your sake.
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page305"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass and
            upon my heart ; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I
            will place it upon my—upon my nose—and there wear it
            ever afterwards, in the less romantic, and less fashionable,
            but certainly in the more serviceable form which you
            desire.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Our conversation now turned upon the details of our
            arrangements for the morrow. Talbot, I learned from my
            betrothed, had just arrived in town. I was to see him at
            once, and procure a carriage. The soiree would scarcely
            break up before two ; and by this hour the vehicle was to
            be at the door ; when, in the confusion occasioned by the
            departure of the company, Madame L. could easily enter
            it unobserved. We were then to call at the house of a
            clergyman who would be in waiting ; there be married,
            drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever
            comments upon the matter it thought best.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and
            went in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could, not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature ; and this I did by the powerful
            aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly
            beautiful one ! Those large luminous eyes !—that proud
            Grecian nose !—those dark luxuriant curls !—“ Ah !” said
            I exultingly to myself, “ this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved !” I turned the reverse, and discovered the words—“Eugenie Lalande—aged twenty-seven
            years and seven months.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint nim with my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most
            cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. In
            a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter ;
            and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the
            ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and
            driving at a great rate opt of town, in a direction Northeast and by North, half-North.
         </p>
         <p>It had been determined, for us by. Talbot, that, as we
            were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at
            C-----, a village about twenty miles from the city, and
            
         </p>
         <p>there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the
            carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. I
            handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. In the mean time we were shown into a small
            parlor and sate down,
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It was now nearly if not altogether daylight ; and, as
            I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular
            idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really
            the very first moment since my acquaintance with the
            celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, tha-t I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight,
            at all.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ And now, mon ami," said she taking my hand, and so
            interrupting this train of reflection, “ and now, mon cher
            ami, since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded
            to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of
            our agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you
            also have a little favor to bestow—a little promise which
            it is your intention to keep. Ah !-—let me see-! Let me
            remember ! Yes , full easily do I call to mind the precise
            words of thee dear promise you made to Eugenie last
            night. Listen! You spoke thus: “It is done!—it is
            most cheerfully agreed ! I sacrifise every feeling for your
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass,
            and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that
            morning which gives me the privilege of calling you
            wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose—and there
            wear it, ever afterwards, in the less romantic, and less
            fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable form
            which you desire.’ These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ They were,” I said ; “ you have an excellent memory;
            and assuredly, my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial
            promise they imply. See ! Behold ! They are becoming—
            rather—are they not ?” And here, having arranged the
            glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them
            gingerly in their proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed in a somewhat undignified position.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Goodness gracious me !” I exclaimed almost at the
            very, instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled
            upon my nose—“My! goodness gracious me!—why
            what can be the matter with these glasses ?” and taking
            them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk
            handkerchief, and adjusted them again.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this
            surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound—was extreme—indeed I maysay it was horrific. What, in the name of everything
            hideous, did this mean ? Could I believe my eyes ?—
            could I ?—that was the question. Was that—was that—
            was that rouge? And were those—were those—Were
            those wrinkles, upon the visage of Eugenie Lalande ?—
            And, oh, Jupiter ! and every one of the gods and goddesses, little and big !—what—what—what—what had become of her teeth ? I dashed the spectacles violently to
            the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the
            middle of the floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my
            arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the
            same time utterly speechless and helpless with terror and
            with rage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande—that is to say, Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better than she wrote it: and for
            this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it
            upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to
            any extreme ; and in the present case it carried Mrs.
            Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting
            to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Veil, Monsieur," said she, after surveying me, in
            great apparent astonishment, for some moments—“ Veil,
            Monsieur!—and vat den ?—vat de matter now ? Is it de
            dance of de Saint Vitusse dat you ave ? If not like me,
            vat for vy buy de pig in de poke ?”
         </p>
         <p>“You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“ you—
            you—you villainous old hag!”
            “Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! me not one
            single day more dan de eighty-doo.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“ Eighty-two !” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—
            “eighty-two hundred thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years and seven months!”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true ! but den de portrait has been take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go
            marry my segonde usbande, Monsieur Lalande, at dat time
            I had de portraite take for my daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart.”
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page306"></div>
            “Moissart!” said I.
            
         </p>
         <p>“ Yes, Moissart, Moissart;” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak the truth, was none of the
            best; “ and vat den ? Vat you know bout de Moissart ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him
            at all only I had an ancestor of that name, once upon a
            time.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name ?—
            ’T is ver goot name ; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot
            name, too. My daughter, Madamoiselle Moissart, she
            marry von Monsieur Voissart; and de name is bote ver
            respectaable name.”
         </p>
         <p>“Moissart!” I exclaimed, “ and Voissart! why what is
            it you mean ?”
            
         </p>
         <p>“ Vat I mean ?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for
            de matter of dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I
            only tink proper to mean it. My daughter’s daughter,
            Madamoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur Croissart, and, den agin, my daughter’s grande daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart;
            and I suppose you say dat dat is not von ver respectaable name.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “ why surely
            you don’t say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and
            Froissart ?”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“ Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair,
            and stretching out her lower limbs at great length ; “ yes,
            Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart. But
            Monsieur Froissart, he was von ver big vat you call fool—
            he vas von ver great big donee like yourself—for he lef
            la belle France for come to dis stupide Amerique—and
            ven he get here he vent and ave von ver stupide, von ver,
            ver stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me nor my companion, de
            Madame Stephanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon
            Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too,
            is not von ver respectaable name.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the
            effect of working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with
            great labor, she jumped up from her chair like somebody
            bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of
            bustle as she jumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed
            her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves,
            shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance
            by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair,
            the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a
            yell, and there trampled and danced a fandango upon it,
            in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had
            vacated. “ Moissart and Voissart !” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and “ Croissart
            and Froissart!” as she completed another—“Moissart
            and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart !—why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me—that’s
            me—d’ye hear ?—that's me"—here I screamed at the top
            of my voice—“ that's me e e ! I am Napoleon Bonaparte
            Froissart! and if I hav n’t married my great, great,
            grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded !”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson—formerly
            Moissart—was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at
            eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural
            contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her
            girlhood. By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge,
            of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to
            hold a respectable footing among the beauties un peu passées of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed,
            she might have been regarded as little less than the equal
            of the celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and, for the purpose of
            making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in
            company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative
            of her second husband’s—a Madame Stephanie Lalande.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention
            was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me
            through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain
            family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and
            knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the
            city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me.—
            The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and
            told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny ; and this scrutiny it was
            which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd
            manner already detailed. She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I
            had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my
            weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect
            to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded
            so enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded
            that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course,
            and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was
            “ the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In the street next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance;
            and the conversation, very naturally, turned upon myself.
            My deficiencies of vision were then explained ; for these
            were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their
            notoriety ; and my good old relative discovered, much to
            her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me
            aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making
            a fool of myself, in making open love, in a theatre, to an
            old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this
            imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept out of my way, to avoid giving me the introduction. My street inquiries about “ the lovely widow,
            Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course; and thus the conversation with the
            three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving Talbot’s hotel, will be easily explained, as also their
            allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of
            seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at
            her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid
            of glasses, effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. When “ Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended ; and it
            was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great,
            grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the
            same moment, and accompanying her to the piano in the
            main drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her
            thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety
            of my remaining where I was ; but my own prudential
            views rendered this unnecessary. The songs which I so
            much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of
            the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame
            Stephanie Lalande. The eye-glass was presented by
            way of adding a reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I
            was so especially edified. It is almost superfluous to add

         <p>that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old
            lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years. They suited me, in fact to a t.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal
            knot, was a boon companion of Talbot’s, and no priest.—
            He was an excellent “whip,” however ; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great coat, he drove the hack
            which conveyed the “ happy couple” out of town. Talbot took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels were
            thus “ in at the death,” and, through a half open window
            of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama. I believe I shall
            be forced to call them both out.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great,
            grandmother ; and this is a reflection which affords me
            infinite relief but I am the husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame Stephanie Lalande—with whom my
            good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when
            she dies—if she ever does—has been at the trouble of
            concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux, and am never to be met without

         <p>To ---------
            Oh! they never can know that heart of thine,
            Who dare accuse thee of flirtation!
            They might as well say that the stars, which shine
            In the light of their joy o’er Creation,—
            Are flirting with every wild wave in which lies
            One beam of the glory that kindles the skies.
            Smile on then undimmed in your beauty and grace!
            Too well e’er to doubt, love, we know you;—
            And shed, from your heaven, the light of your face,
            Where the waves chase each other below you;
            For none can e’er deem it your shame or your sin,
            That each wave holds your star-image smiling within.

         <p>We have again to apologise to our publishing friends
            for the brevity of our Critical Notices. In our next number we shall devote more than usual attention to this Department. There are several important works now lying
            before us, of which it is our intention to speak in detail—
            Mrs. Kirkland’s new book, for example—Von Raumer's
            America—and the Life of Schiller—one of the Appleton
            series. We wish to say much, also, of the Annuals and
            Gift-Books—very especially of “ The Missionary Memorial,” “ The Diadem,” “ The Rose,” and “ The Mayflower,”—the best of these works, as far as we have yet had
            an opportunity of judging. For the present (owing to the
            bustle consequent upon removing our office) we must content ourselves with a mere announcement of the books
            on hand for notice.

            To his first shrine of beauty, when the heart

         <p>Mrs. V. Mott's Concert.—One of the most fashionable
            audiences we ever witnessed, crowded the Apollo Saloon
            that evening. The fair debutante was received with loud
            cheers whenever she made her appearance. Thou art
            lovelier, and the Wanderer, were the gems of the performance. Indeed, no other piece, than the latter, could
            haves shown the beautiful contralto of Mrs. Mott. We
            were not so much pleased with the first of her pieces.—
            Here and there it is said, but only in a whisper—it was a
            failure. We do not think so. Laboring under many disadvantages, Mrs. Mott acquitted herself even better than
            we thought she would. She will sing again at the Philharmonic Concert. To speak of the other part of the performance : Mr. P. Mayer is becoming quite a favorite —
            He sang the Exile, a German composition, most beautifully, and his rich baritone voice was never displayed to
            better advantage. Messrs. Kyle and Timm played the
            duett for Flute and Piano exquisitely ; Mr. K„ particularly, was better than on any other occasion. The duett of
            Messrs. Loder and Timm, however well played, did not
            please much. A like fate had the first concerted piece.
            But altogether, we. think a repetition of the Concert in
            the Tabernacle, would not be amiss.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Mr. Leopold De Meyer, the Lion-pianist; as they will
            have it, had a crowded house on the night of his second
            concert. He was encored several times. It seems, that
            of all the pianists in this city, Mr. Perabeau alone can
            muster courage enough to wrestle with him for the
            wreath of laurels. But we have mentioned already, that
            whatever gestures he makes, in whatever position, he
            forces himself, or however he thumps on the piano, he
            can never make the public believe that he is as great as
            De Meyer; though he has this advantage, that whenever
            Dantan wishes to make a caricature of the great pianist,
            Perabeau, he need not trouble himself to invent one.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Miss Northall did not sing as well as usual, owing,
            perhaps, to the hasty travelling from Philadelphia, where
            she sang but the night before,'to this city. Madame Lazare and Mr. Mayer acquitted themselves well. . De
            Meyer is now in Boston, but no accounts of his triumph,
            for such we expect, certainly, have reached us as yet.

         <p></p>
         <p>The Oratorio of Sampson will be performed under the
            direction of Mr. LL C. Hill, at the Tabernacle. We
            think, that, substituting another for this, would do us no
            harm; however, we have no doubt it will be well performed. Mr. Paige will make his first appearance as a
            public singer, so the papers say. We wonder that the
            New-York Sacred Music Society employs Boston artists
            for the different solo parts ? Is there any want of good
            vocalists here ?

            the Magic Flute, Don Juan, Czaar and Zimmerman, together with the best Italian Operas with German text.—
            Mr. P. Mayer and Meyer, also Miss Windmuller will
            form part of the troupe. How far. is will succeed, we
            know not, but we wish them success from the bottom of
            our heart.

            be a guarantee for the other three. But it is of the two
            latter that we wish to speak more particularly. We
            have perused them again and again, and have found
            nothing worth noticing save the titles : the one for its
            miserable lithography, the other for its length. The
            composers of both are amateurs.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The amateurs’ object of publishing compositions is like
            that of a great many brothers of the profession—to satisfy a little vanity—to be thought a genius and prodigy by
            the uninitiated, and to be thought a fool by the knowing
            ones. If it would serve at all to advance the cause of
            music, not a word would we have to say ; but it is just
            the very thing which corrupts musical taste. Publishers
            who are secured from loss, by sufficient exchange with
            other publishers, print anything they can get hold of, provided no remuneration, save a few copies, of the piece, is
            asked for it. People will have new music, and not finding anything good, they get indifferent at last, and take
            whatever the publisher recommends them, as long as a
            showy title adorns the composition. No wonder that
            musicians do not publish their pieces here, when they
            can get, at least, a fair price for them at other places, and
            have no competition with badly lithographed titles and
            and yard-long dedications. Messrs. Hart and Stone’s
            pieces are no better nor worse than hundreds of others ;
            and we are almost sorry that they should be the ones we
            have to vent our spleen at. But let it be a good lesson to
            all amateur composers. We shall not spare them as long
            as we are able to hold a pen, or as long as they do not reform, and study the rules of composition and thoroughbass, before publishing anything.

         <p>Reports from all parts of the country show a most prosperous condition of affairs throughout the American theatrical world.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In every place, where attraction is even expected,
            houses are crowded ; and new candidates for popular favor are constantly pressing forward. During the past
            week the question of the merit and praiseworthiness of
            various foreign performers, has come up in different quarters.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In the opinion of a portion of the press, a regular deception is practised on the pockets of the public, by artists from the old world past their prime or who have
            never attained a prime, from sheer want of faculty. On
            the other hand a claim to supernatural gifts in musical
            and dramatic execution, is claimed by partizans equally
            violent. On all these points we have our own opinion,
            which we shall take occasion to spread at length before
            our readers, hereafter. Among those who have been subject of discussion, we find named Mr. Leopold De Meyer

         <p>pianist, Mr. Ole Bull, violinist, Mr. Charles Kean, tragedian, Mr. Templeton, vocalist. The Sequins also at
            Philadelphia, and the Delcy company, have participated
            in these doubts. These things arc ominous, and when we
            come to consider them, we shall do so without unfair national bias, and with reference only to the general standards of art and merit. Among the incidents of the past
            week, one of the most striking has been the presentation
            to Mr. Murdoch at Philadelphia, of an elegant copy of
            Shakspeare. It occurred on Friday evening, the night
            of his benefit, before a most brilliant audience, after his
            performance of Hamlet.
         </p>
         <p>We present the speeches, which embody the purpose
            and sentiment of the occasion.
            Col. Page, in presenting the volume to Mr. Murdoch,
            said:—
            
         </p>
         <p>Mr. Murdoch ,—At the request of numerous friends and some of
            your schoolmates, I am here to-night in the discharge of a pleasing
            duty—that of presenting you with a testimonial of the regard they
            feel for you as a man, and the favorable opinion which they entertain of your abilities as an Actor.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It comes in the shape of this superbly bound and approved edition
            of the works of the Immortal Bard, to whose varied and delightful
            creations, in your recent round of performances in this city and
            elsewhere, you have imparted new beauties, and given increased
            interest.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>It is intended by this offering, appropriate as I regard it to be, to
            stimulate you in the highly praiseworthy but arduous task you have
            undertaken, and show that your townsmen, ready as they have ever
            been to patronize merit from abroad, (for mind, Heaven's priceless
            gift to man belongs to no country and is bound by no clime,) can
            never be indifferent to Native Talent, but will always foster and encourage and cheer it onward to a bright and brilliant future.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Allow me then to hand you these beautiful volumes, a deserved
            tribute to personal worth and professional skill. Such a combination, aided and guided by Industry and Genius, must command success; they will win for you the proudest chaplet of Histrionic
            Fame, and add another name to the already glorious list of the distinguished sons of the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.
         </p>
         <p>To which, Mr. Murdoch replied :—
            
         </p>
         <p>Co... Page:—In accepting this valuable and beautiful copy of
            the works of the great master of the human heart, permit me to express my deep sense of gratitude to the kind donors for the gift, and
            to yourself for the generous feelings which prompted you in becoming the presenter. We are told, sir, that life is a sandy desert, with
            but few green spots in it to cheer the weary traveller. The many
            acts of kindness I have received at the hands of the citizens of Philadelphia, from my first appearance before them till the present moment, have truly, however, made my desert smile with continued
            verdure, and abound with flowers—sweet and lasting.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>This present is doubly dear to mb—first, as it is the page of truth
            and nature, and the field in which I labor; and next, as coming
            from the hands of those who were boys with me, and who now, as
            men. step forward to cheer on an old co-mate through the rugged
            paths which lead to public honors. Their deeds of friendship “are
            registered, where every day I turn the leaf to read them.” May
            heaven bless them, one and all.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, please accept my thanks for
            your kindness this evening, and during the evenings of the past
            fortnight. Should I ever grow regardless of the deep debt I owe
            my native city, the sight of these volumes, and one glance thrown
            back by memory to this memorable night, and the brilliant array
            befere me, will suffice to awaken all those feelings of gratitude
            and affection with which my heart is now eating, and to the utterance of which my tongue struggles in vain for expressions of
            deep-seated and heart-felt thankfulness.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I shall have the pleasure of making .my bow to you, once more,
            tomorrow night, after which I shall leave you for the present,for
            other scenes. Most respectfully, Adieu—tendered, on my part,
            with a full determination to deserve a continuance of your favors.
            Adieu! Adieu!

         <p>We have to apologize for the insufficient variety of the

         <p>As we very confidently expected, our friends in the
            Southern and Western country (true friends, and tried,)
            are taking up arms in our cause—and more especially in
            the cause of a national as distinguished from a sectional
            literature. They cannot see (it appears) any farther necessity for being ridden to death by New-England. Hear
            the “Charleston Patriot” :
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Poe’s Poetry.—Mr. Edgar A. Poe is one of the most remarkable, in many respects, among our men of letters. With singular
            endowments of imagination, he is at the same time largely possessed of many of the qualities that go to make an admirable critic;—he is methodical, lucid, forcible,—well-read, thoughtful, and
            capable, at all times, of rising from the mere consideration of the
            individual subject, to the principles, in literature and art, by which
            it should be governed. Add to these qualities, as a critic, that he
            is not a person to be overborne and silenced by a reputation;—
            that mere names do not control his judgment;—that he is bold, independent, and stubbornly analytical, in the formation of his opinions. He has his defects also;—he is sometimes the victim of capricious moods;—his temper is variable—his nervous organization being such, evidently, as to subject his judgments, sometimes,
            to influences that may be traced to the weather and the winds.—
            He takes his colour from the clouds; and his sympathies are not
            unfrequently chilled and rendered ungenial, by the pressure of the
            atmosphere—the cold and the vapors of a climate affecting his moral nature, through his physical, in greater degree than is usual
            among literary men,—who, by the way, are generally far more
            susceptible to these influences, than is the case with the multitude.
            Such are the causes which occasionally operate to impair the value
            and the consistency of his judgments as a Critic.—As a Poet, Mr.
            Poe’s imagination becomes remarkably conspicuous, and to surrender himself freely to his own moods, would be to make all his
            writings in verse, efforts of pure imagination only. He seems to
            dislike the merely practical, and to shrink from the concrete. His
            fancy takes the ascendant in his Poetry, and wings his thoughts to
            such superior elevations, as to render it too intensely spiritual for
            the ordinary reader. With a genius thus endowed and constituted,
            it was a blunder with Mr. Poe to accept the appointment, which
            called him to deliver himself in poetry before the Boston Lyceum.
            Highly imaginative men can scarcely succeed in such exhibitions.
            The sort of poetry called for on such occasions, is the very reverse
            of the spiritual, the fanciful or the metaphysical. To win the ears
            of a mixed audience, nothing more is required than moral or patriotic common places in rhyming heroics. The verses of Pope are
            just the things for such occasions. You must not pitch your flight
            higher than the penny-whistle elevation of
         </p>
         <p>“ Know then this truth, enough for man to know,
            Virtue alone is happiness below.’’
            
         </p>
         <p>Either this, or declamatory verse,—or something patriotic, or some,
            thing satirical, or something comical. At all events, you must
            not be mystical. You must not task the audience to study. Your
            song must be such as they can read running, and comprehend
            while munching pea-nuts. Mr. Poe is not the writer-for this sort
            of thing. He is too original, too fanciful, too speculative, too anything in verse, for the comprehension of any but audience fit though
            few' In obeying this call to Boston, Mr. Poe committed another
            mistake. He had been mercilessly exercising himself as a critic
            at the expense of some of their favorite writers. The swans of
            New England, under his delineation, had been described as mere
            geese, and those, too, of none of the whitest. He had been exposing the short comings and the plagiarisms of Mr. Longfellow,
            who is supposed, along the banks of the Penobscot, to be about the
            comliest bird that ever dipped his bill in Pieria. Poe had dealt
            with the favorites of Boston unsparingly, and they hankered after
            their revenges. In an evil hour, then, did he consent to commit
            himself, in verse to their tender mercies. It is positively amusing
         </p>
         <p>
            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page310"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>to see how eagerly all the little witlings of the press, in the old
            purlieus of the Puritan, flourish the cirtical tomahawk about the
            head of their critic. In their eagerness for retribution, one of the
            papers before us actually congratulates itself and readers on the
            (asserted) failure of the poet. The good editor himself was not
            present, but he hammers away not the less lustily at the
            victim, because his objections are to be made at second hand.—
            Mr. Poe committed another error in consenting to address an audience in verse, who, for three mortal hours, had been compelled to
            sit and hear Mr. Caleb Cushing in prose. The attempt to speak
            after this, in poetry, and fanciful poetry, too, was sheer madness.
            The most patient audience in the world, must have been utterly
            exhausted by the previous infliction. But it is denied that Mr.
            Poe failed at all. He had been summoned to recite poetry. It is
            asserted that he did so. The Boston Courier, one of the most
            thoughtful of the journals of that city, gives us a very favorable
            opinion of the performance which has been so harshly treated.—
            'The Poem,” says that journal, “called ‘ The Messenger Star,’
            was an eloquent and classic production, based on the right principles, containing the essence of true poetry, mingled with a gorgeous
            imagination, exquisite painting, every charm of metre, and a
            graceful delivery. It strongly reminded us of Mr. Horne’s
            ‘Orion,’ and resembled it in the majesty of its design, the nobleness of its incidents, and its freedom from the trammels of productions usual on these occasions. The delicious word-painting of
            some of its scenes brought vividly to our recollection, Keats’
            ' Eve of St. Agnes,’ and parts of ‘ Paradise Lost.’
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>That it was malapropos to the occasion, we take the liberty to
            deny. What is the use of repeating the ‘ mumbling farce’ of
            having invited a poet to deliver a poem We (too often) find a
            person get up and repeat a hundred or two indifferent couplets of
            words, with jingling rhymes and stale witticisms, with scarcely a
            line of poetry in the whole, and which will admit of no superlative
            to describe it. If we are to have a poem, why not have the ‘ true
            thing,’ that will be recognize! as such,—for poems being written
            for people that can appreciate them, it would be as well to cater
            lor their tastes as for individuals who cannot distinguish between
            the true and the false.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The good sense of this extract should do much towards enforcing the opinion which it conveys; and it confirms our own, previously entertained and expressed, in regard to the affair in question. Mr. Poe’s error was not, perhaps, in making verses, nor
            making them after a fashion of his own; but in delivering them
            before an audience of mixed elements, and just after a discourse
            of three mortal hours by a prosing orator. That any of his hearers should have survived the two-fold infliction, is one of those instances of good fortune which should bring every person present
            to his kness in profound acknowledgement to a protecting providence.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We thank our friend of "The Patriot” and agree with
            him fully, of course, in all points except his disparagement of Mr. Cushing, who read us a very admirable discourse. “ The Patriot,” it will be understood, has not
            yet seen our reply of week before last.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Were the question demanded of us—‘‘What is the
            most exquisite of sublunary pleasures ?” we should reply,
            without hesitation, the making a fuss, or, in the classical
            words of a western friend, the “ kicking up a bobbery.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Never was a “bobbery” more delightful than that
            which we have just succeeded in “ kicking up” all around
            about Boston Common. We never saw the Frog-Pondians so lively in our lives. They seem absolutely to be
            upon the point of waking up. In about nine days the
            puppies may get open their eyes.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>That is to say they may get open their eyes to certain
            facts which have long been obvious to all the world except themselves—the facts that there exist other cities
            than Boston—other men of letters than Professor Longfellow—other vehicles of literary information than the
            “ Down-East Review.”
         </p>
         <p>As regards our late poem.—Hear the “St, Louis Re-
            veille.”
            
         </p>
         <p>“ The Broadway Journal is edited and owned solely by Mr. Edgar A. Poe. If he had as much tact as talent, he would make success for half a dozen papers.”</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>So says an exchange paper. Poe, reliant upon his talent, has
            too much contempt for tact; he is wrong, but his error makes his
            career the more remarkable. He is full of eccentricity. Does he
            mean, by the following, that his late Boston Poem, was intended by
            him as a hoax ?
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>“We have been quizzing the Bostonians, and one or two of the
            more stupid of their editors and editresses have taken it in high dudgeon. We will attend to them all in good time.”
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>To our friend Field we thus reply: We had tact
            enough not to be “ taken in and done for” by the Bostonians. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes—(for timeo substitute contemno or turn-up-our-nose-o). We knew very
            well that, among a certain clique of the Frogpondians,
            there existed a predetermination to abuse us under any
            circumstances. We knew that, write what we would,
            they would swear it to be worthless. We knew that
            were we to compose for them a “ Paradise Lost,” they
            would pronounce it an indifferent poem. It would have
            been very weak in us, then, to put ourselves to the trouble of attempting to please these people. We preferred
            pleasing ourselves. We read before them a “juvenile”
            —a very “juvenile” poem—and thus the Frogpondians
            were had—were delivered up to the enemy bound hand
            and foot. Never were a set of people more completely
            demolished. They have blustered and flustered—but
            what have they done or said that has not made them
            more thoroughly ridiculous?—what, in the name of Momus, is it possible for them to do or to say ?
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>We “ delivered” them the “juvenile poem” and they
            received it with applause. This is accounted for by the
            fact that the clique (contemptible in numbers as in every
            thing else) were overruled by the rest of the assembly.
            These malignants did not dare to interrupt by their preconcerted hisses, the respectful and profound attention of
            the majority. We have been told, indeed, that as many
            as three or four of the personal friends of the little old
            lady entitled Miss Walters, did actually leave the hall
            during the recitation—but, upon the whole, this was the
            very best thing they could do. We have been told this,
            we say—we did not see them take their departure :—the
            fact is they belong to a class of people that we make it a
            point never to see.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The poem being thus well received, in spite of this
            ridiculous little cabal—the next thing to be done was to
            abuse it in the papers. Here, they imagined, they were
            sure of their game. But what have they accomplished ?
            The poem, they say, is bad. We admit it. We insisted
            upon this fact in our prefatory remarks, and we insist
            upon it now, over and over again. It is bad—it is wre'ched—and what then ? We wrote it at ten years of age'—
            had it been worth even a pumpkin-pie undoubtedly we
            should not have “delivered” it to them.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>To demonstrate its utter worthlessness, “The Boston
            Star” (a journal which, we presume, is to be considered
            as a fair representative of the Frogpondian genius) has
            copied the poem in full, with two or three columns of
            criticism (we suppose) by way of explaining that we
            should have been hanged for its perpetration. There is
            no doubt of it whatever—we should. “ The Star,” however, (a dull luminary) has done us more honor than it
            intended ; it has copied our third edition of the poem,
            revised and improved. We considered this too good for
            the occasion by one half, and so “ delivered” the first
            edition with all its imperfections on its head. It is the
            first—the original edition—the delivered edition—which
            we now republish in our collection of Poems.
         </p>

            <div class="pagebreak" id="#page311"></div>
            
         </p>
         <p>Repelled at these points, the Frogpondian faction hire a
            thing they call the “ Washingtonian Reformer” (or something of that kind) to insinuate that we must have been
            “intoxicated” to have become possessed of sufficient audacity to “ deliver” such a poem to the Frogpondians.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In the first place, why cannot these miserable hypocrites say “ drunk” at once and be done with it ? In the
            second place we are perfectly willing to admit that we
            were drunk—in the face of at least eleven or twelve hundred Frogpondians who will be willing to take oath that
            we were not. We are willing to admit either that we
            were drunk, or that we set fire to the Frog-pond, or that
            once upon a time we cut the throat of our grandmother.
            The fact is we are perfectly ready to admit any thing at
            all—but what has cutting the throat of our grandmother
            to do with our poem, or the Frogpondian stupidity?
            We shall get drunk when we please. As for the
            editor of the “Jeffersonian Teetotaler” (or whatever
            it is) we advise her to get drunk, too, as soon as possible—for when sober she is a disgrace to the sex—on account of being so awfully stupid.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>N. B. The “ Washingtonian Teetotaler” is edited by a
            little old lady in a mob-cap and spectacles—at least, we
            presume so, for every second paper in Boston is.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>P. S. Miss Walters (the Syren!) has seen cause, we
            find, to recant all the ill-natured little insinuations she
            has been making against us (mere white lies—she
            need not take them so much to heart) and is now overwhelming us with apologies—things which we have
            never yet been able to withstand. She defends our poem
            on the ground of its being “juvenile,” and we think the
            more of her defence because she herself has been juvenile
            so long as to be a judge of juvenility. Well, upon the
            whole we must forgive her—and do. Say no more about
            it, you little darling ! You are a delightful creature and
            your heart is in the right place—would to Heaven that
            we could always say the same thing of your wig !
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In conclusion:—The Frogpondians may as well spare
            us their abuse. If we cared a fig for their wrath we
            should not first have insulted them to their teeth, and
            then subjected to their tender mercies a volume of our
            Poems:—that, we think, is sufficiently clear. The fact is,
            we despise them and defy them (the transcendental vagabonds !) and they may all go to the devil together.

         </p>
         <p>Up HIS edition of the Holy Scriptures has already received the approbation of the American clergy of all denominations. Mr.
            Fletcher’s abilities for the task he has undertaken are well known. 
            The notes, like the engravings, are so contrived as not to interrupt 
            the sacred text. The examination of the work is its best advertisement. No. 12 has a beautiful engraving of “ Jepthah’s return.”—
            The 12 numbers already issued show good evidence that the publisher’s department will not vary, except for the better. Single
            numbers 25 cents.

         <p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
            England: it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
            seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
            being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
            and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
            East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this
            celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in
            tensely interesting narrative of his experience.

            is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Characteristics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious
            about tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that
            the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming lar too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought
            to be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
            its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work
            is elegantly printed as a library book, and adorned by some dozen
            curious fac-similes of oriental drawings.”—Courier and Enquirer.

            Seventh edition, revised by the author, with numerous engravings,
            1 vol. 12mo.—$1. “Few characters have stood out more boldly
            on our Revolutionary Annals, or have supplied more interesting
            and exciting materials for the historian, than that of Gen. Marion ;
            and it is not saying too much to claim for the work before us no
            less the merit of accredited historical truth, than the most stirring
            and absorbing attributes of high-wrought fiction.”—Democratic
            Review.

         <p>“Praed was the Poet of Society, ‘a fellow of infinite humor,’
            and in scholarship and art, surpassed by none of the English poets
            of the age. Though many of his pieces have been almost universally read in this country, they have never yet been printed collectively, either here or in England.”—Democratic Review.

            DENTISTRY.
            
         </p>
         <p>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office 446
            Houston St., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
            Church.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Doct. S’s experience and skill in his profession, give him confidence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any
            Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
            varies in many essential points from the usual mode ; and his success in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
            difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
            of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
            same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
            artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
            natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
            natural appearance. In all these points, Doct S.’s manner is preeminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to
            surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
            generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
            makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and in cases
            where the gum has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
            the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
            causes a contraction of the lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of
            which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
            which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
            redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, render detection impossible.
         </p>
         <p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
            the best families in this City, in which he has practised.
            Ladies who desire it, can have their teeth examined at their re-
            sidences, by sending their address as above.	nov. 8—9t

         <p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
            retailed by small dealers,'in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
            because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
            in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
            price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F.
            Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
            in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
            and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and
            deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them
            above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas
            retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine
            article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No one, it is presumed,
            wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
            giving full details on this subject, which may be had at their
            Warehouse, 75 Fulton street, free of charge.

         <p>W3 drink Green Ten, and for many years have been paying one dollar per
            pound for it. But thinks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea
            from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one pound per week, by which
            we are now saving thirteen dollars per year, and enjoying better tea in the
            bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea Company, say we.—Mirror.

         <p>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
            lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
            warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the public. We know
            that their Teas, both in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many
            a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
            in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length he has become hopeless
            of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market, a kind
            which had not such an effect. Xu this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
            of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor-cultivated and
            picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into this
            country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have, an Oolong,
            mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
            nervous persons. Its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
            to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
            never before drank such tea. But all testes can here be suited, with the great
            advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The Company's Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—
