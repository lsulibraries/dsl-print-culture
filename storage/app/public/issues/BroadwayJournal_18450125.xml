         <p>Truth, whether in or out of fashion, is the measure of knowledge and the busi-
<br/>ness of the understanding; whatsoever is beside that, however authorised by con-
<br/>sent or recommended by variety, is nothing but ignorance, or something worse.</p>

REVIEWS.
Hints on the Re-organization of the Navy. New York: Wiley
and Putnam.
</p>
         <p>A subject of greater importance to the people of the Uni-
<br/>-ted States, or one about which they appear to care less, than
<br/>the re-organization of the Navy, could hardly be selected to
<br/>form the topic of a pamphlet.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“It is admitted very generally by those acquainted with the sub-
<br/>-ject,” says the writer before us, “that the Navy of the United States
<br/>is defective in its organization; that the laws, rules, and regulations
<br/>by which it is governed require remodelling, although complaints from
<br/>the Navy may not have reached the public ear in tones sufficiently
<br/>loud to attract attention. Grievances, nevertheless, exist.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And from this promising paragraph we hoped to find
<br/>something in the remainder of the “hints,” which would
<br/>expose the gross wrongs of our naval system, and suggest
<br/>some means for their removal. But, the author, though
<br/>evidently belonging to the service, seems not to be aware
<br/>that there are any other wrongs in the Navy but such as the
<br/>civil department of it suffer, from inadequate pay and the
<br/>want of a definite rank. This has been the general complaint
<br/>of all the officers in the service, ever since the last war; the
<br/>service is going to kingdom come for the want of a higher
<br/>grade of officers, say those who have reached the highest,
<br/>while those still in the line of promotion complain of insuffi-
<br/>-cient pay, and the slowness with which they go up.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But it is not of the slightest consequence to the nation,
<br/>whether an assistant surgeon in the Navy eats his meals in
<br/>the cock-pit with the midshipmen, or in the ward-room with
<br/>the lieutenants and purser; nor whether he receive twelve
<br/>hundred and fifty or fifteen hundred dollars a year; yet, it is
<br/>to reform such abuses as these that the author has published
<br/>his “hints;" he had a right to do so, but he will get nothing
<br/>but his labor for his pains.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>One of the complaints of the secretary of the Navy, in his
<br/>report to Congress is, that “the Oregon had to proceed to sea
<br/>recently with a citizen surgeon,” which our author thinks a
<br/>good reason for reform. There are a good many merchant-
<br/>ships leaving our harbor every day, for distant ports, with no
<br/>other surgical aid than such as the captain and his mates
<br/>can render, with the assistance of a few exceedingly brief di-
<br/>-rections contained on the lid of his medicine chest; yet we
<br/>believe that our merchant-ships lose as few men by disease
<br/>as our national vessels.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The only persons of whom our author seems to have any
<br/>knowledge in the Navy, are those that wear epaulettes. He
<br/>does not appear to know that there are such beings as sailors
<br/>on board of our national ships. Not a word is said in their
<br/>behalf, not a whisper breathed, that they have any wrongs
<br/>to be redressed.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Instances can be cited of commanding officers so far forgetting
<br/>their own dignity and what is due to others, as to profanely curse in
<br/>loud tones on the quarter-deck surgeons and other civil officers of the
<br/>Navy. Such instances are rare, it is true; but they have occurred,
<br/>and may occur again.”</p>
         <p>This is very curious. It would be hard to cite an instance
of a commanding officer who had not so far forgot his own
</p>
         <p>dignity as to curse in loud tones the sailors under his com-
<br/>-mand; and we must confess to that degree of simplicity as
<br/>not to perceive any very marked difference between a sailor
<br/>and a surgeon, so far as usefulness on ship board and the dig-
<br/>-nity of humanity are concerned.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The following particulars in regard to midshipmen are
<br/>well worth the consideration of the people, not one in a hun-
<br/>-dred of whom know, probably what they have to contribute
<br/>towards the education and support of the children and ne-
<br/>-phews of prominent politicians.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Midshipmen are admitted into the Navy between the ages of four-
<br/>-teen and sixteen. All the qualification required to obtain an appoint-ment, is political influence, or the favor of those in power. By law or
<br/>regulation no degree of primary education is requisite. It is usual,
<br/>however, for those appointed to be more or less instructed in the sim-
<br/>-ple elements, or at least the rudiments of a common English education.
<br/>To remedy this deficiency in some measure, 'twenty-two’ professors
<br/>of mathematics are maintained in the Navy, at a salary of $1,200 a
<br/>year each, or in other words, it costs the government $26,400 annual-
<br/>-ly, to instruct 356 midshipmen in those elementary branches of mathe-
<br/>-matics deemed sufficient to enable them to read Bowditch’s system of
<br/>navigation: in round numbers preceptors’ fees amount to upwards of
<br/>$74 annually for every midshipman in the Navy, a sum sufficient to
<br/>pay the annual cost of a collegiate course. Besides professors of ma-
<br/>-thematics, the government provides three teachers of languages. In
<br/>addition to all this, every midshipman receives in pay from $300 to
<br/>$473 yearly, and has little or nothing to offer in return, except the
<br/>promise or prospect of some day being capable of performing the duty
<br/>of a lieutenant; or in other words, he is paid while receiving his pro-
<br/>-fessional education at the cost of the government.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>No sooner does a youngster of sixteen receive an appoint-
<br/>-ment in the service, than his fortune is made; he is booked
<br/>for the highest rank and the highest pay in the service,
<br/>wholly irrespective of merit; by the time he reaches the age
<br/>of forty-five he will receive a better salary than the vice pre-
<br/>-sident of the Union, and yet he need never fire a shot, or
<br/>spend a quarter of his time on ship board. Although it is
<br/>requisite that the sea-going officers of the service should en-
<br/>-ter it at an early age, that they may make themselves per-
<br/>-fectly familiar with their duties; yet the chief director of
<br/>the service; the one who holds sole control of the navy, and
<br/>may do what he likes with the ships and officers in it, is
<br/>generally a country attorney, who has never seen blue water,
<br/>and who could not tell a cat-head from a bulk-head to save
<br/>himself from perdition. That there should be errors and
<br/>abuses in a service so governed is a matter of course.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>To gain employment in any of the civil departments of the
<br/>government, some fitness for the office which you may fill is
<br/>considered necessary; not so with the Navy. Our author
<br/>says, very pertinently,—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Unfortunately for the country, owing to peculiar notions and usa-
<br/>-ges, the highest qualifications are advanced no more rapidly than the
<br/>most marked stolidity; advancement is regulated by the miller’s rule. 'first come, first served,’ as promotions to fill vacancies in the superior
<br/>grades are made from the first on the list of the next grade below.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“The career of a military seaman is a glorious career. He surely
<br/>rises, though very slowly, in dignity and consideration, and last,
<br/>though not least, his pecuniary reward increases from $300 to $4500
<br/>annually, as he passes from the foot of the list of midshipmen to the
<br/>head of the list of captains, which he does in from thirty-five to forty
<br/>years.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We have known some peculiar cases of unfitness in the ser-
<br/>-vice, where the officers went up side by side with the best
<br/>fellows in it. We happened once to witness an instance
<br/>where the commander of one of our national vessels would not
<br/>allow one of his lieutenants to have charge of a vessel in the
<br/>night time, because he was afraid to trust the ship in his
<br/>keeping. Yet this incompetent officer will, in a few years, be</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p50"/>
himself a commander. Such gross favoritism cannot be
shown in the British service.
</p>
         <p>“Before, an officer obtains a lieutenant’s commission in Her Majes-
<br/>-ty’s Navy, he must have passed five examinations; but in the Navy of
<br/>the United States, he is required to pass but one; to prepare for
<br/>which, six months’ study is usually enough to ensure success.’’</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Which method,” our author pointedly asks, “is likely to
<br/>produce the most efficient lieutenants, the British or the
<br/>American?” and, “supposing the two systems to be followed
<br/>out as they now exist in the two nations, is it not probable
<br/>that the officers of the British Navy, as a body, will be supe-
<br/>-rior, in professional attainments, to those of the Navy of the
<br/>United States?’’</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are two important questions to be asked in regard
<br/>to the Navy, and no aims at reform in this department of
<br/>national expenditure can amount to any good, unless they be
<br/>considered. First, is there any necessity for a Navy at all,
<br/>when there is neither a war, nor a prospect of one; and se-
<br/>-condly, if a Navy is necessary, why should the citizens of the
<br/>country, who enter the lowest ranks of the service, be debar-
<br/>-red from rising in it, by good conduct, bravery, and genius?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There are few people, who never been on board of our
<br/>national ships, that have any idea of the degraded condition
<br/>of the seamen that serve in them. For the three years that
<br/>they enlist, they are as much cut off from the privileges of
<br/>freemen, as though they had never stepped foot on American
<br/>soil. Their commander may flog them on their naked backs,
<br/>as often as he may be in humor to do so, which is sometimes
<br/>of very frequent recurrence; and if they should look sour under
<br/>their punishment, they will be in danger of suspension, not
<br/>from duty, but from the yard-arm. The law limits the cruelty
<br/>of a commander to twelve lashes with a cat on the bare back
<br/>of a sailor, for any one offence; but an angry man, with un-
<br/>-limited authority, pays but little regard to law; and we have
<br/>known an officer to inflict three dozen lashes on the back of
<br/>one of his men, under the pretence that he had committed
<br/>three offences. But abuses like these do not appear to have
<br/>come under the notice of the author of this book, for among
<br/>all his hints for re-organizing the Navy, he hints nothing
<br/>about bettering the condition of the right arm of the service,
<br/>or putting the citizens of the union who serve as seamen on
<br/>board of our national ships, on a level with those who enter
<br/>it with a warrant in their pocket.</p>

         <p>The Natural Boundaries or Empires, and a New View of Colo-
<br/>nization. By John Finch, Esq., Corresponding Member of the
<br/>Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, and of the Natural His-
<br/>-tory Societies of Montreal, New York, New Brunswick, Delaware,
<br/>etc. London: Longmans, 1844. Imported by Wiley &amp; Putnam.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Sydney Smith, or somebody else, said once that the pre-
<br/>-sent was an age of persiflage. We can hardly open a book
<br/>on any subject, which does not contain a dash of satire. The
<br/>gravest lessons are now taught in a vein of humor, and all
<br/>our philosophers are professed jokers. There seems to be
<br/>nothing serious but fun, and nothing funny which is not
<br/>serious. The favorite jest book of the day is the Comic
<br/>Blackstone; and the legitimate successors of Addison and
<br/>Johnson, are the contributors to Punch. Upon our own side
<br/>of the water, we have, as yet, no didactic humorists; our
<br/>sermons contain as little humor as they well can; and our
<br/>humorous writers would run little danger of being mistaken
<br/>for preachers. Our jokes are nothing but jokes, and none of
<br/>our political writers have yet aimed at enlightening the peo-
<br/>-ple, or enlivening their essays, by witticisms in disguise. We
<br/>certainly had no expectation of meeting anything punchy in
<br/>a philosophical essay on the natural boundaries of empires;
<br/>but the corresponding member of the Natural History Socie-
<br/>-ties of Montreal, New York, New Brunswick, etc., is not</p>
         <p/>
         <p>free from the contagion of the age. There is irony in every
<br/>page of his book; it reads like the papers in Punch, or the
<br/>preface to Martin Chuzzlewit; but it contains more of the
<br/>philosophy of history than we ever before saw compressed
<br/>into so small a space. The author must be an old man, for
<br/>he was a correspondent of Madison’s, and he appears to have
<br/>distilled this volume from the studies of a life-time. His
<br/>knowledge of American affairs is very exact and minute, and
<br/>his national prejudices are nothing. He seems to have en-
<br/>-tirely forgotten the place where he was born, for he shows no
<br/>partiality for any particular part of the globe; and though an
<br/>Englishman, he makes no boast of British glory. He men-
<br/>-tions the fact, incidentally, that there are three millions of
<br/>slaves in the United States, but he has no more prejudices
<br/>against the south than Mr. Calhoun, or father Ritchie. His
<br/>book is of great value to America, now, when we are striving
<br/>to change the boundaries of the empire, and we hope that
<br/>some of our publishers will undertake its republication. A
<br/>copy of it should be placed in the hands of every member of
<br/>Congress, and a large one, like a pulpit bible, should be nailed
<br/>to the desk of the Secretary of State, from which he should
<br/>be required to read a chapter every morning.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Much of the book is of that scrappy, anecdotical charac-
<br/>-ter, which so well suits the taste of a people, whose favorite
<br/>reading is found in magazines.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Many persons,” says Mr. Finch, “imagine that walnuts were
<br/>created, because the nut is good to eat, but they are quite mistaken;
<br/>they hang in profusion from the trees because they exhibit the true
<br/>model for the hull of a ship. If you examine attentively the shell of
<br/>a walnut, you perceive that one extremity is sharp, exhibiting all the
<br/>qualities of a beautiful prow, while the other end expands with all the
<br/>dignity and proportions of a Dutch galliot.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>He is a profound lover of the ocean, like most of his coun-
<br/>-trymen, whom we never suspected of so strong an attachment
<br/>as he makes them have.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“An Englishman who resides in the interior of the country, and is
<br/>not able to visit the ocean or the sea once a year, always expires of
<br/>ennui, although the learned physicians who attend him give the dis-
<br/>-ease a different name.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Unlike the majority of British writers, he draws as many
<br/>of his illustrations from the United States, as from the states
<br/>of Europe.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“The most philosophical treaty of peace in relation to boundaries
<br/>ever recorded in history, was that between the States of North Caro-
<br/>-lina and Tennessee. Their boundary being undetermined, they agreed
<br/>that the highest ridge of the Appalachian chain should form the
<br/>boundary line. Commissioners were appointed to take the altitude of
<br/>the several ranges, and the highest being ascertained, both parties
<br/>acquiesced in the result. In other parts of the world, rather than
<br/>have made such a treaty, they would have covered every hill with
<br/>wounded, and they would have filled every valley with slain.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Here is a prophecy which cannot be very far from being
<br/>fulfilled. Massachusetts and South Carolina are doing what
<br/>they can to bring it about.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“America is arranged almost in natural divisions. It is probable
<br/>that, at some future day, the New England States, throwing off the
<br/>weight of the federal yoke, may once more become free. Thus, on
<br/>the surface of the earth, man finds it impossible to change the decree
<br/>of that Almighty Power, whose will governs the Universe.”</p>
         <p>When Mr. Finch composed his book, we had not raised
the cry of Polk, Dallas and Texas.
</p>
         <p>"Make room there! make room! come, arrange yourselves in the
<br/>boxes, and take your seats in the pit, and those who cannot find room
<br/>elsewhere, may go into the gallery, and we will see the spectacle
<br/>which the world now exhibits. There are going to pass before us on
<br/>the stage, in triumphal procession, the various conquering nations,
<br/>with their banners displayed, and bearing the insignia of war, and
<br/>with their unhappy captives at their feet. See! the lamps afford a
<br/>brilliant light, the curtain is about to rise. Keep silent, and do not
<br/>speak a word.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“ Who comes there? see, in the van of conquering nations, comes
<br/>Great Britain, a free representative monarchy, her swords are red
<br/>with blood, her bayonets are bent and twisted in the struggle, her can-
<br/>-non are hot with firing repeated charges of balls. Ten empires, which
<br/>once had independent sovereigns, are crushed beneath her chariot
<br/>wheels; seven republics, anxious to pursue their glorious career of
<br/>enterprise and fame, are chained beneath her feet. She has conquered
<br/>and retains in subjection one hundred millions of people! Pass on.</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p51"/>
         </p>
         <p>“What see we next? Ah! here is a nation who profess themselves
<br/>republicans, and who believe that if all the liberty which the nations
<br/>of the earth ever possessed was collected and placed in a single pile,
<br/>it would form an insignificant heap in comparison with that which they
<br/>enjoy. These are the United States of America, who call themselves
<br/>the freest of the free. And what are they about? Keep silent. They
<br/>have room in their present territory for two hundred millions of peo-
<br/>-ple, but that is not sufficient; and they are fitting out an expedition to
<br/>take possession of Oregon, and are exterminating the unfortunate
<br/>Seminoles because they will not part with the hunting grounds of their
<br/>fathers. Pass on!”</p>
         <p>His acquaintance with our political affairs is as intimate as
of our geographical boundaries.
</p>
         <p>“The boundaries of the United States present many phenomena
<br/>that are worthy of being attentively studied. In examining these,
<br/>we must remember that the people have yielded to a central govern-
<br/>-ment the distinctive mark, the most important prerogative of sovereign
<br/>power, the right of making peace and declaring war. The frontiers
<br/>of the several states must therefore, under the present form of govern-
<br/>-ment, be judged rather as divisional lines of one territory, than as
<br/>rival jealous nations, ready to war with each other on the slightest
<br/>pretexts. It may however be observed, that in most important ques-
<br/>-tions brought before Congress, although every member enjoys and ex-
<br/>-ercises the privilege of speech, only three members are allowed to vote.
<br/>These are representatives of the South, the East, the West. All the
<br/>artificial divisions of territory disappear before the powerful influence
<br/>of natural boundaries.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Finch proposes to erect Long Island into an indepen-
<br/>-dent state, and we like his proposition exceedingly. The east
<br/>end of Long Island reaches out towards Connecticut, and
<br/>seems to be striving for a closer neighborhood with New
<br/>England. It is quite impossible that the people of Sag Har-
<br/>-bor and Sackett’s Harbor should ever think alike in regard to
<br/>politics. They may both vote for the same men, as they
<br/>often do, but they must differ when they come to conclusions.
<br/>We do not know how the project of Mr. Finch will suit our
<br/>neighbors, but if they should adopt it, we should be very
<br/>likely to make one amongst them.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“We have in a former page, proposed that the island of Nassau,
<br/>contiguous to New York, should form an independent State. It is
<br/>larger in extent than Rhode Island, and nearly as populous as Dela-
<br/>-ware. A friend here whispered in my ear, ‘What trouble you are
<br/>going to cause to these unfortunate people. If they are to be free,
<br/>they will require a constitution, and will want a governor. Then only
<br/>consider the caucuses, the political meetings of young and old men,
<br/>the votes, the resolutions, the remonstrances, and counter-resolutions,
<br/>and the opposite meetings of federalists and democrats, and national
<br/>republicans of the old and new school.’ Struck with his remark, I
<br/>replied, ‘I will give them a constitution, and I will be their governor.’</p>
         <p>CONSTITUTION OF THE ISLAND OF NASSAU.
</p>
         <p>Any person who expressed a wish to subdue or to purchase any
<br/>neighboring territory, or to found a colony and keep it in subjection,
<br/>should be esteemed an enemy to his countrymen, for he would add to
<br/>their taxes, and take away from their happiness.</p>
         <p>The community should be entirely agricultural.
He who sowed most wheat, or Indian corn, should be esteemed a
friend to his country.
He who planted a peach orchard should be a senator for life.
He who shot the fattest buck should be captain in his district for a
year.
He who produced the most wine might have the pleasure of sending
a cask to each of his neighbors.
He who caught the largest quantity of fish should have the privilege
of keeping open-house until all were consumed.
</p>
         <p>He who raised the fattest ox should be at liberty to keep him in
<br/>a beautiful paddock, and to walk round him once a day as long as he
<br/>lived.</p>
         <p>No lawyers would be necessary, for there would never be any dis-
-putes.
No physicians would be requisite, for the human race, exempt from
care, would be free from disease.
There would be no robbers, for no man would attempt to steal a
barn, or to run away with a cow.
All would be good, and therefore all would be happy.
The only misfortune that could possibly happen to these people
would be when the sun did not ripen the peaches.
</p>
         <p>No penitentiaries should be built, for if they built one, they must
<br/>build two; they must finally cover the whole face of the island with
<br/>penitentiaries, and the foul sight of those receptacles of crime would
<br/>disfigure the fair face of nature. Instead of the care and the money of
<br/>the State being lavished on criminals, it should be bestowed in quite a
<br/>different direction—in the education of the innocent and poor.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>And then with their seas full of fish, their woods full of game, their
<br/>orchards full of peaches, and their gardens full of roses, they might
<br/>enjoy the happiest life in the world.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The chapter on the boundaries of the British Empire is
<br/>very gorgeous; the vastness of English possessions are well
<br/>summed up in the following verses:</p>
         <p>"Gold is gathered in our stream,
Diamonds are found in our rock,
Pearls grow in our water,
Rubies shine in our mine.
A Meteor-fire plays with our wave,
A Cataract falls in our colony,
A Water-spout gathers in our climate,
A Sand-storm rages in our province.
Cotton grows on our bush,
Sugar ripens in our canes,
Cocoa flourishes in our groves,
Coffee is gathered from our plants.
The Mango falls in our field,
The Tamarind grows in our garden,
The Plantain clusters in our orchard,
The Pomegranate blushes in our wood.
The Cinnamon grows on our isthmus,
The Clove hardens on our peninsula,
The Pineapple lives on our island,
The Grape ripens on our continent.
The Cowry lives on our shore,
The Conch travels on our beach,
The Pholas bores on our rock,
The Trumpet-shell sounds on our sand.
The Lion wars on our plain,
The Wolf howls on our hill,
The Tiger fights in our jungle,
The Leopard hunts in our wood.
The Beaver builds in our pond,
The Moose-deer browses our moss,
The Giraffe eats our tender shrubs,
The Polar Bear warms himself on our ice.
The Kangaroo leaps on our plain,
The Spring Bok jumps on our valley,
The Antelope bounds on our upland,
The Gazelle dances on our lowland.
The Crocodile smiles in our stream,
The Brown Bear frowns in our wood,
The Hyaena laughs in our cave,
The Panther moans in our grove.
The Sloth climbs on our tree,
The Monkey chatters on our rock,
The Boa sleeps on our soil,
The Baboon lives on our fruit.
The Condor flies in our province,
The Scorpion bites in our kingdom,
The Polypus arms in our sea,
The Fire-fly shines in our garden.
The Turtle slumbers on our beach,
The Humming Bird flies in our grove,
The Ostrich walks on our sand,
The Flamingo sentries our land.
The Whale gambols in our ocean,
The Shark preys in our sea,
The painted Dolphin strives in vain
To rival the color on our flag.
The Nautilus sails on our sea,
The Blue Fish rows in company,
The Flying-Fish leaps in our water,
The Porpoise plays in our waves.
The Sturgeon leaps in our river,
The White Fish glitters in our lake,
The Muscanonge is captain in our water,
The Cat Fish lives in our brooks.
</p>
         <p>And the salmon swims up our rivers every year as far as he can, to
<br/>inquire whether people who have conquered so many nations are hap-
<br/>-py and contented at home. But what are all these foreign birds, and
<br/>beasts, and fishes? One little robin redbreast, is worth them all
<br/>combined; the note of the skylark is more pleasing to the ear than
<br/>the roar of the lion; and the chirp of the household sparrow is more
<br/>agreeable than the cry of the flamingo.”</p>
         <p>We fear that there is too much truth in the following:
</p>
         <p>"The time will never arrive when the human race will cease to
<br/>connect the idea of political happiness with extended dominion; yet
<br/>an empire too extended is unfavorable to the happiness of those over
<br/>whom it is exercised. The farmer, on the Atlantic coast of North
<br/>America, when rejoicing in the extension of the Confederacy to new
<br/>States in the far west, forgets that it deprives him of that self-govern-
<br/>-ment for which his ancestors fought so bravely and so well.</p>
         <p>“Thus the same laws apply to the boundary of nations, under
whatever form of government they choose to remain.
</p>
         <p>“The liberty of a country depends very much on the same circum-
<br/>-stance. A nation is as much deprived of liberty and self-govenment
<br/>by extensive conquests, as the people over whom it exercises an unjust
<br/>sway. Some may say, What is the use of this liberty, whose acquisi-
<br/>-tion demands so much toil, and whose preservation demands such
<br/>constant care?</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“We reply, Liberty is invaluable. She is the parent of every good
<br/>to man. Without liberty, man is like a horse that is flogged, an ox
<br/>that is goaded, or an ass whose ears have been pulled to an unnatural
<br/>length.</p>
         <p>“For when the ass was first created, his ears were no longer in pro-
-portion to his size, than those of any other animal; but being of a firm
<a href="#p52"/>
         </p>
         <p>disposition, which his enemies called obstinacy, and declining on
<br/>some occasions to proceed when he considered himself too heavily
<br/>laden, his enemies began to pull at his ears, until by the lapse of time
<br/>they have become of their present size.</p>

         <p>The author of this work, we understand, was in this coun-

<br/>acquaintance with our geographical distinctions.</p>
         <p>St. Ignatius and his First Companions. By the Rev. Charles Con-
-stantine Pise, D.D. Edward Dunigan, 151 Fulton street, 1845.
</p>
         <p>Among the nine first companions of Ignatius, four preceded
<br/>him to the tomb, namely, Peter Faber, St. Francis Xavier,
<br/>Claudius Jaius, and John Cordurius. The lives of these are
<br/>given to the conclusion; of the others, James Layner, Al-
<br/>phonsus Salmeron, Nicholas Bobadilla, Simon Rodriguez,
<br/>and Paschasius Broetus, the author has only given their lives
<br/>down to the time when their chief was taken from them.
<br/>"The principal object I had in view,” says the author, “in
<br/>not carrying out their history after the death of St. Ignatius,
<br/>was, to exhibit the spirit which he, in person, diffused
<br/>throughout the body, and thereby confute, by evidence, the
<br/>vain calumny, that he was a fanatic, and his first disciples
<br/>were intriguers and impostors.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The author manifests an unbecoming fear of the term
<br/>“fanatic”: it is only another word for earnestness. His pa-
<br/>-tron would never have become a saint, if he had not first
<br/>been a fanatic. We protestants are so much used to speak
<br/>of Ignatius Loyala in no very devout terms, that perhaps
<br/>some will be a little startled to hear him spoken of as Saint
<br/>Ignatius; but Dr. Pise is, himself, of the order which Loyala
<br/>founded: he was educated by its brethren. His work is, of
<br/>course, the labor of a loving and reverent heart, and will
<br/>commend itself by its sincerity even to those who may dif-
<br/>-fer with its author about the merits of his patron.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>As an example of the style in which the work is written,
<br/>we give the following extract from the chapter on Saint Ig-
<br/>-natius:—</p>
         <p/>
         <p>"Wearied and much agitated from a strange and recent apparition,
<br/>a noble looking cavalier, robed in the plain guise of a pilgrim, sat
<br/>down to repose him on the banks of a gentle stream, not far from the
<br/>village of Manreza.* The deep shadows were now falling from the
<br/>neighboring hills: over the brow of Mount Serat, the dusk of the eve-
<br/>-ning seemed already wreathing its sombre twilight, the waters of the
<br/>lonely river rippled beneath the breath of the solitude’s breeze.
<br/>There, in profound contemplation, with his dark-gray eyes fixed in-
<br/>-tently upon the river, sat that wondrous stranger. His elegant mien,
<br/>his broad, high forehead, his aquiline nose, his beautiful yet manly
<br/>features, bespoke the high rank to which he belonged, and the mag-
<br/>-nanimous character with which he was adorned. He had recently
<br/>fought, at the head of a chivalrous army, for the liberties of Spain,
<br/>and had been wounded in her glorious cause, on the walls of Pampelu-
<br/>na. He had been confined to his bed, suffering intense pain from the
<br/>extraction of the ball which had entered his leg, and the amputation
<br/>of a bone which protruded from the wound. During this period of
<br/>lingering and solitary illness, he had sought to relieve his tedium, and
<br/>engage his mind with reading. No works of fancy or books of chiv-
<br/>-alry being within his reach, he had recourse to a volume of the Lives
<br/>of the Saints, in which he beheld depicted, for the imitation of great
<br/>souls, their heroic virtues, and sublime sanctity. The transition, in
<br/>such a mind as his, from one species of chivalry to another, was very
<br/>easy and natural; he had been trained up to that of arms and martial
<br/>enthusiasm; he could without difficulty, appreciate that of peace and
<br/>religious glory. As he read on, his heart opened as it were, to the di-
<br/>-vine influences of Christian heroism; his soul insensibly began to glow
<br/>with an ardour more ennobling than he had before experienced; a de-
<br/>-sire to emulate the splendid moral achievements of the examples be-
<br/>-fore him, an irresisitible admiration of their victories over themselves
<br/>and their triumphs over the world, urged forward his generous ambi-
<br/>-tion; and the grace of God co-operating, meanwhile, with his natural
<br/>dispositions, he determined to change the standard of war for the en-
<br/>sign of the cross. He had laid aside from his towering person the in-
<br/>-signia of knight, and taken upon himself those of an humble penitent,
<br/>making a pilgrimage from shrine to shrine. Over the altar of the ev-
<br/>-er-blessed Virgin he had hung the sword which was still gleaming</p>
         <p/>
         <p>*The singular vision here alluded to is thus described by Orlandinus, in
<br/>his History of the Society of Jesus: “A very comely image appeared to him
<br/>in the air, the figure of which he could not clearly discern. It was lengthy,
<br/>like the form of a serpent, bright, and of various hues, and glittering with
<br/>many eyes, like stars: which, while it appeared rendered him happy, and
<br/>when it vanished left him sorrowful.” Lib. i. 22, p. 7. The conversion of
<br/>Ignatius happened in 1521. He was in his thirty-first year.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>with the lustre of valour—a bright, a splendid trophy of the grace of
<br/>God. For that brave spirit that knew not how to cower before the ter-
<br/>-rors of the cannon, was stricken down in profound subjection—not to
<br/>any human power—and lain prostrate, by the “violence” of the love of
<br/>God. Sweet violence, indeed, that gives no pain but contrition, and
<br/>demands no subjection but a calm submission to the will of Heaven.
<br/>Violence which, it is true, storms the citadel of the heart, but renders
<br/>it, at the same time, a voluntary captive: which sometimes achieves
<br/>its object by forcing the deep and silent tear from the fountains of
<br/>some Magdalen's soul, and, at other times, by casting down headlong
<br/>—blind and terror-stricken—on the sward, some Saul of Tarsus. That
<br/>extraordinary personage, meditating, at this twilight hour, on the
<br/>banks of the Rubricato, is the immortal founder of the Society of Je-
<br/>-sus—Ignatius of Loyola.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Between the epoch of the birth of this defender of the ancient faith,
<br/>and that of Martin Luther, its pest and scourge, a space of nine years
<br/>occurred: the former having been born in 1491, the latter in 1482. God,
<br/>whose providence could but prepare a barrier against the calamities
<br/>which he foresaw were about to desolate his Church, raised up Igna-
<br/>-tius, as a host in the company which he was destined to establish,
<br/>for her defence and edification. Guipuzcoa, a province in Cantabria,
<br/>was the place of his nativity. His family was noble and renowned.
<br/>His father and mother were both of illustrious origin. His youthful
<br/>disposition tended to the study and the feats of arms: and, having, at a
<br/>maturer age, embraced the military profession, he won the applause
<br/>of his country and reaped no little glory on the field. This soldier-
<br/>-like character he impressed on the company which he instituted. It
<br/>appears in the celerity of obedience on the part of its members, in the
<br/>enduring of labour, and the missionary exercises—all modeled on the
<br/>exemplar of the camp. His soul, from early childhood, burned with
<br/>inextinguishable ardour for renown, and human praise: which natural
<br/>impetuosity, changed and chastened under holier influences, he carried
<br/>with him into the ranks of religion, and infused into the breasts of his
<br/>disciples. He was distinguished by grace, ease, and majesty of man-
<br/>-ners, and a singular love of elegance of dress; which qualities he af-
<br/>-terwards hallowed, and transferred to sacred things, and made auxili-
<br/>-ary to the discipline and spirit of his order. He possessed a sublime
<br/>magnanimity in pardoning an offence, as well as in conferring a fa-
<br/>-vour: an innate detestation of avarice, and—the germ of all vices—
<br/>cupidity. He exhibited a lofty daring in dangerous and difficult exer-
<br/>-tions; a singular prudence in the transaction of business, and an un-
<br/>-wearied and patient perseverance and constancy of character. In the
<br/>flower of youth he displayed the maturity of age; and in the first im-
<br/>-pulse of his conversion was raised, on a sudden, to the highest grade
<br/>of perfection.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Hence the sublime ascetic character of his book of 'Spiritual Exer-
<br/>-cises,’ written so soon after his retreat to Mount Serat, and his aus-
<br/>-tere and penitential musings at Manreza. Hence his marvellous ec-
<br/>-stasy, in which, wrapt in the contemplation of heavenly things, during
<br/>eight days, he seemed dead to those of earth. And hence, too, that sol-
<br/>-emn vow of chastity by which he devoted himself forever to the ser-
<br/>-vice of God, ‘ following the Lamb whithersoever he went.’ This per-
<br/>-fection displayed itself in all his actions. Whether we trace him to the
<br/>isle of Cyprus, on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land; whether we view
<br/>him, entering—an humble palmer—upon the consecrated soil of Pal-
<br/>-estine, prostrate, in tears, at the tomb of Christ partaking of the Re-
<br/>-deemer’s agony on the mount of Olives; whether we behold him fa-
<br/>-voured with celestial visions, or wrecked on the shoals near the coast
<br/>of Cyprus, or, on his return to Europe, seized upon and contumaciously
<br/>treated as a spy in France:—under all circumstances, and in every
<br/>condition, there was a grandeur of soul, a sanctity of motive, and an
<br/>enthusiasm of virtue, which stamped him, at once, with that transcen-
<br/>dant character, which was wonderfully developed in the course of his
<br/>subsequent career.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“The ‘Company’ he established, was destined to labour for the sal-
<br/>-vation of men, and to propagate the greater glory of Jesus Christ.
<br/>Hence the motive for his styling it the 'Society of Jesus:’ deriving its
<br/>name from him, who is the only true salvation of the human race, and
<br/>who promised to be ‘propitious to him at Rome.’”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It is among the handsomest specimens of printing that
<br/>we have seen from the New York press; but the frontis-
<br/>-piece of portraits is altogether unworthy, in point of exe-
<br/>-cution, to rank with the other parts of the book.</p>

</p>
         <p>One of the chief merits of this book is its freedom from
<br/>those patronising and approbatory passages with which pop-
<br/>-ular writers on similar subjects intersperse their speculations.
<br/>Dr. Dick is probably the worst of the whole tribe, and the
<br/>author of the work before us, the best. But he is not wholly
<br/>free from this wearisome fault. The only two qualities really
<br/>needed in authors of books of this class, are: first, accuracy
<br/>of information; and second, clearness of style. Every word,
<br/>beyond what is necessary to convey a fact, is felt to be lumber;
<br/>and all reflections upon the goodness and greatness of the
<br/>Creator, are, to speak of them in the mildest terms, insults to
<br/>the understanding of the reader. It must be taken for granted
<br/>that any person who will be likely to read a work on Natural
<br/>History, has already formed an idea that God is both great</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p58"/>
         </p>
         <p>and good, beyond the capacity of man to comprehend. We do
<br/>not see the propriety of taxing the undevout astronomer with
<br/>madness, any more than the undevout husbandman. The
<br/>man who fails to see God in a butter-cup, will hardly discern
<br/>him by looking at the Georgium Sidus through a telescope.
<br/>Whoever can contemplate himself, without being impressed
<br/>with the thought that God is all-wise and all-powerful, will
<br/>never be awe-struck from a contemplation of the Heavens.
<br/>The following extract from the first chapter contains a good
<br/>many of these objectionable passages. What have we to do
<br/>with the “tear that falls from childhood’s cheek,” in a work
<br/>professedly scientific? The tear that falls from an old man’s
<br/>cheek is of precisely the same quality.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“It is remarkable of physical laws, that we see them operating on
<br/>every kind of scale as to magnitude, with the same regularity and
<br/>perseverance. The tear that falls from childhood’s cheek is globular,
<br/>through the efficacy of that same law of mutual attraction of particles
<br/>which made the sun and planets round. The rapidity of Mercury is
<br/>quicker than that of Saturn, for the same reason that, when we wheel
<br/>a ball round by a string and make the string wind up round our fin-
<br/>-gers, the ball always flies quicker and quicker as the siring is short-
<br/>ened. Two eddies in a stream, as has been stated, fall into a mutual
<br/>revolution at the distance of a couple of inches, through the same
<br/>cause which makes a pair of suns link in mutual revolution at the dis-
<br/>-tance of millions of miles. There is, we might say, a sublime simpli-
<br/>city in this indifference of the grand regulations to the vastness or mi-
<br/>-nuteness of the field of their operation. Their being uniform, too,
<br/>throughout space, as far as we can scan it, and their being so unfail-
<br/>-ing in their tendency to operate, so that only the proper conditions
<br/>are presented, afford to our minds matter for the gravest considera-
<br/>-tion. Nor should it escape our careful notice that the regulations on
<br/>which all the laws of matter operate, are established on a rigidly ac-
<br/>-curate mathematical basis. Proportions of numbers and geometrical
<br/>figures, rest at the bottom of the whole. All these considerations,
<br/>when the mind is thoroughly prepared for them, tend to raise our
<br/>ideas with respect to the character of physical laws, even though we
<br/>do not go a single step further in the investigation. But it is impossi-ble for an intelligent mind to stop there. We advance from law to the
<br/>cause of law, and ask, what is that? Whence have come all these beautiful regulations? Here science leaves us, but only to conclude,
<br/>from other grounds, that there is a First Cause to which all others are
<br/>secondary and ministrative, a primitive almighty will, of which these laws are merely the mandates. That great Being, who shall say where is his dwelling-place, or what his history? Man pauses breath-
<br/>-less at the contemplation of a subject so much above his finite facul-
<br/>-ties, and only can wonder and adore!”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A tolerable purity of style seems almost impossible with writers of this class. They cannot read the Bible to any good purpose, or they would write better. The author before
<br/>us has more to recommend him on this score than many others, but he seems to be impressed with an idea that a great subject requires great swelling words. He should, in the outset, fix upon some term by which to express his idea of the Omnipotent, and dismiss the thought that he is called
<br/>upon, personally, to assert the dignity of his Creator. He seeems to labor under a continual fear that his readers have not a sufficient reverence for their Creator, and he bestows
<br/>upon Him a great variety of high-sounding expletives. The
<br/>August Being, the Deity, the Divine Wisdom, the Divine Au-
<br/>-thor, Almighty Perfection, the Great Creator, Providence,
<br/>Creative Providence, Almighty Conception, Great Father,
<br/>Almighty Wisdom, &amp;c., &amp;c., occur with variations through-
<br/>-out the book.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The most interesting chapter in the book is that relating to
<br/>vegetable and animal generation. It is treated here with
<br/>great delicacy, originality, and power, and will prove inter-
<br/>-esting even to those who differ from the author in his conclu-
<br/>sions; as many will. The theory that man sprang from the
<br/>first order of organic life, and that he passes, now, through
<br/>all the conditions of fish, reptile, and bird, is fanciful in the
<br/>extreme. If it were true, men of premature birth, would
<br/>more nearly resemble the simia than the human race.</p>
         <p>In the chapter on the “Mental Constitution of Animals,”
we find some curious statistical facts.
</p>
         <p>“Even mistakes and oversights are of regular recurrence, for it is
<br/>found in the post offices of large cities, that the number of letters put
<br/>in without addresses is year by year the same. Statistics has made
<br/>out an equally distinct regularity in a wide range, with regard to many</p>
         <p/>
         <p>other things concerning the mind, and the doctrine founded upon it
<br/>has lately produced a scheme which may well strike the ignorant with
<br/>surprise. It was proposed to establish in London a society for ensur-
<br/>-ing the integrity of clerks, secretaries, collectors, and all such func-
<br/>-tionaries as are usually obliged to find security for money passing
<br/>through their hands in the course of business. A gentleman of the
<br/>highest character as an actuary spoke of the plan in the following
<br/>terms: “If a thousand bankers’ clerks were to club together to indem-
<br/>-nify their securities, by the payment of one pound a year each, and if
<br/>each had given security for 500l., it is obvious that two in each year
<br/>might become defaulters to that amount, and so on, without render-ing the guarantee fund insolvent. If it be tolerably well ascertained
<br/>that the instances of dishonesty (yearly) among such persons amount
<br/>to one in five hundred, this club would continue to exist, subject to
<br/>being in debt in a bad year, to an amount which it would be able to
<br/>discharge in good ones. The only question necessary to be asked
<br/>previous to the formation of such a club would be,—may it not be fear-
<br/>-ed that the motive to resist dishonesty would be lessened by the exis-
<br/>-tence of the club, or that ready made rogues, by belonging to it,
<br/>might find the means of obtaining situations which they would other-
<br/>-wise have been kept out of by the impossibility of obtaining security
<br/>among those who know them? Suppose this be sufficiently answered
<br/>by saying, that none but those who could bring satisfactory testimony
<br/>to their previous good character should be allowed to join the club;
<br/>that persons who may now hope that a deficiency on their parts will
<br/>be made up and hushed up by the relative or friend who is security,
<br/>will know very well that the club will have no motive to decline a
<br/>prosecution, or to keep the secret and so on. It then only remains to
<br/>ask, whether the sum demanded for the guarantee is sufficient?” The
<br/>philosophical principle on which the scheme proceeds, seems to be sim-
<br/>-ply this, that, amongst a given (large) number of persons of good
<br/>character, there will be within a year or considerable space of time,
<br/>a determinate number of instances in which moral principle and the
<br/>terror of the consequences of guilt will be overcome by temptations
<br/>of a determinate kind and amount, and thus occasion a periodical
<br/>amount of loss which the association must make up.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It appears, from a foot note, that this proposed association
<br/>has been formed in London, and is working well. A society
<br/>of this kind should be immediately formed in Wall street, and
<br/>in Washington.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The faults that we have discovered in this book are very
<br/>few, and not of a character to detract in the least from its
<br/>popularity. It is admirably calculated for the million, and
<br/>being sold at a low price, it must, we think, meet with a
<br/>rapid sale.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>But where did the publishers of this valuable work obtain
<br/>it? Was it produced by their literary dragoman? or did
<br/>some obliging friend give them the manuscript? It has not
<br/>the appearance of a spontaneous production; yet we can find
<br/>in no part of it, any hint of its origin. It cannot have been
<br/>reprinted from a foreign edition, for the publishers have the
<br/>reputation of honest men, and they would, of course, have
<br/>given some intimation of the fact, if such had been the case.
<br/>A work of similar title has gone through two or three editions
<br/>in London, but we have no right to think that this is the same.
<br/>As good books are not published every day, readers have a
<br/>curiosity to know where one comes from, when they meet
<br/>with a new one; who produced it, what language it first made
<br/>its appearance in, how long it has been before the world, and
<br/>what degree of credit to attach to its statements when they
<br/>are of a novel character. Publishers would confer a benefit
<br/>upon the reading world by giving some intimation, when
<br/>they put forth a new work, of the source whence they derived
<br/>it. If Wiley &amp; Putnam had printed in the title-page of this
<br/>work, "Republished from the third London Edition,” it would
<br/>have been more to their credit, and not in the slightest degree
<br/>detrimental to their interests. Tradesmen who deal in books,
<br/>should set an example of honesty to the rest of the trading
<br/>world.</p>

(Second Notice.)
</p>
         <p>Passages like these in a conversation on Chaucer, appear
<br/>somewhat incongruous when taken by themselves, but they
<br/>spring up as naturally as flowers do from a seemingly ex-
<br/>-hausted soil:</p>
         <p>Philip. The Devil might listen to some preaching I have heard, with-
-out getting his appetite spoiled. There is a great deal of time and
<a href="#p54"/>
         </p>
         <p>money expended to make men believe that this one or that one will be
<br/>damned, and to scare or wheedle them into good Calvinists or Episco-
<br/>-palians but very little pains is taken to make them good Christians.</p>
         <p>John. You use plain words.
</p>
         <p>Philip. Plain words are best. Truth wants no vail; the chastity
<br/>and beauty of her countenance are defence enough against all lewd
<br/>eyes. Falsehood, only, needs to hide her face for, that unseen, she
<br/>has learned so well to mimic the gait and feign the voice of Truth,
<br/>as to counterfeit her with ease and safety. Our tongue has become so
<br/>courtly and polite, as well-nigh to have forgotten that it has also
<br/>words befitting indignation and reproof. Some thoughts demand the
<br/>utmost swell and voluptuousness of language; they should float like
<br/>Aphrodite upborne on a summer ocean. For others, the words should
<br/>be jagged and immitigable and abrupt as the rocks upon the shore.
<br/>Let the feeling of the moment choose. If melody be needed, the
<br/>chance shell of the tortoise shall become a lyre which Apollo might
<br/>sigh for.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>John. It has never been a safe thing to breathe a whisper against
<br/>the church, least of all in this country, where it has no prop from the
<br/>state, but is founded only on the love, or, if you will have it so, the
<br/>prejudices of the people. Religion has come to be esteemed synony-mous with the church; there are few minds clear enough to separate
<br/>it from the building erected for its convenience and its shelter. It is
<br/>this which has made our Christianity external, a task-ceremony to be
<br/>gone through with, and not a principle of life itself. The church has
<br/>been looked on too much in the light of a machine, which only needs
<br/>a little oil, now and then, on its joints and axles, to make it run glibly
<br/>and perform all its functions without grating or creaking. Nothing
<br/>that we can say will be of much service. The reformers must come
<br/>from her own bosom; and there are many devout souls among her
<br/>priests now, who would lay down their lives to purify her. The names
<br/>of infidel and heretic are the San benitos in which we dress offenders
<br/>in the nineteenth century, and a bigoted public opinion furnishes the
<br/>fagots and applies the match! The very cross itself, to which the sa-
<br/>-cred right of private judgment fled for sanctuary, has been turned into
<br/>a whipping-post. Doubtless, there are nations on the earth so wicked
<br/>as those who profess Christianity; and the blame may be laid in great
<br/>measure at the door of the church, which has always sought temporal
<br/>power, and has chosen to lean rather upon the arm of flesh than upon
<br/>that of God. The church has corrupted Christianity. She has decked
<br/>her person and embroidered her garments with the spoils of pagan
<br/>altars, and has built her temples of blocks which paganism had squared
<br/>ready to her hand. We are still Huns and Vandals, and Saxons and
<br/>Celts, at heart. We have carved a cross upon our altars, but the
<br/>smoke of our sacrifice goes up to Thor and Odin still. Lately I read
<br/>in the newspapers a toast given at a military festival, by one of those
<br/>who claim to be earthly representatives of the Prince of Peace. Eng
<br/>land and France send out the cannon and the bayonet, upon mission-ary enterprises, to India and Africa, and our modern Elliots and Brai-
<br/>nerds among the red men are of the same persuasive metal.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Philip. Well, well, let us hope for change. There are signs of it:
<br/>there has been a growling of thunder round the horizon for many days.
<br/>We are like the people in countries subject to earthquakes, who
<br/>crowd into churches for safety, but find that their sacred walls are as
<br/>fragile as other works of human hands. Nay, the very massiveness
<br/>of their architecture makes their destruction more sudden, and their
<br/>fall more dangerous. You and I have become convinced of this. Both
<br/>of us, having certain reforms at heart, and believing them to be of vi-
<br/>-tal interest to mankind, turned first to the church as the nearest helper
<br/>under God. We have been disappointed. Let us not waste our time
<br/>in throwing stones at its insensible doors. As you have said, the re-
<br/>-formers must come from within. The prejudice of position is so
<br/>strong, that all her servants will unite against an exoteric assailant,
<br/>melting up, if need be, the holy vessels for bullets, and using the
<br/>leaves of the holy book itself for wadding. But I will never enter a
<br/>church from which a prayer goes up for the prosperous only, or for
<br/>the unfortunate among the oppressors, and not for the oppressed and
<br/>fallen; as if God had ordained our pride of caste and our distinctions
<br/>of color, and as if Christ had forgotten those that are in bonds. We are
<br/>bid to imitate God: let us in this also follow his example, whose only
<br/>revenge upon error is the giving success to truth, and but strive more
<br/>cheerfully for the triumph of what we believe to be right. Let us,
<br/>above all things, imitate him in ascribing what we see of wrong-
<br/>doing to blindness and error, rather than to wilful sin. The Devil
<br/>loves nothing better than the intolerance of reformers, and dreads noth-
<br/>-ing so much as their charity and patience. The scourge is better upon
<br/>our backs than in our hands.</p>
         <p>John. When the air grows thick and heavy, and the clouds gather
</p>
         <p>in the moral atmosphere, the tall steeples of the church are apt to
<br/>attract the lightning first. Its pride and love of high places are the
<br/>most fatal of conductors. That small upper room, in which the disci-
<br/>ciples were first gathered, would always be safe enough.</p>
         <p>We have given an extract on the Dignity of Poverty: we
give one below on the false dignity of Death.
</p>
         <p>John. It is singular what ugly portraits of Death are ordinarily given
<br/>us. There seems to be but little living faith in the immortality of the
<br/>soul—so soon does any idea become formal and external, when diluted
<br/>by the customariness of a creed. Men do not believe in the next world
<br/>as they do in London or Boston; they do not launch upon the igno-
<br/>tum mare with a shadow of that prophetic belief which girded up the
<br/>heart of Columbus. Most religion-mongers have baited their paradises
<br/>with a bit of toasted cheese. They have templed the body with large
<br/>promise of possessions in their transmortal El Dorado. Sancho Panza
<br/>will not quit his chimney corner, but under promise of imaginary
<br/>islands to govern. For my own part, I think it wiser to make the spirit
<br/>a staff for the body, than the body for the spirit. When the vessel
<br/>casts off for the voyage, and the body finds itself left behind, it may well
<br/>cry out and disturb the whole vicinage with the story of its wrong.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Philip. I agree with you that the body is treated with quite too
<br/>much ceremony and respect. Even religion has vailed its politic hat
<br/>to it, till, like Christopher Sly, it is metamorphosed, in its own esti-
<br/>-mation, from a tinker to a duke. Men, who would, without compunc-
<br/>tion, kick a living beggar, will yet stand in awe of his poor carcass,
<br/>after all that rendered it truly venerable has fled out of it. We agree
<br/>with the old barbarian epitaph, which affirmed that the handful of
<br/>dust had been Ninus; as if that which convicts us of mortality and
<br/>weakness could at the same time endow us with our high prerogative
<br/>of kingship over them. South, in one of his sermons, tells us of cer-
<br/>tain men whose souls are of no worth, but as salt to keep their bodies
<br/>from putrifying. I fear that the soul is too often regarded in this sut-
<br/>-ler fashion. Why should men ever be afraid to die, but that they re-
<br/>-gard the spirit as secondary to that which is but its mere appendage
<br/>and conveniency, its symbol, its word, its means of visibility? If the
<br/>soul lose this poor mansion of hers by the sudden conflagration of dis-
<br/>-ease, or by the slow decay of age, is she therefore houseless and shel-
<br/>-terless ? If she cast away this soiled and tattered garment, is she
<br/>therefore naked? A child looks forward to his new suit, and dons it
<br/>joyfully; we cling to our rags and foulness. We should welcome
<br/>Death as one who brings us tidings of the finding of long-lost titles to
<br/>a large family estate, and set out gladly to take possession, though, it
<br/>may be, not without a natural tear for the humbler home we are leav-
<br/>-ing. Death always means us a kindness, though he has often a gruff
<br/>way of offering it. Even if the soul never returned from that chartless
<br/>and unmapped country, which I do not believe, I would take Sir John
<br/>Davies’s reason as a good one:</p>
         <p>“But, as Noah’s pigeon, which returned no more,
Did show she footing found, for all the flood;
So, when good souls, departed through death’s door,
Come not again, it shows their dwelling good.”
</p>
         <p>The realm of Death seems an enemy’s country to most men, on
<br/>whose shores they are loathely driven by stress of weather; to the
<br/>wise man it is the desired port where he moors his bark gladly, as in
<br/>some quiet haven of the Fortunate Isles; it is the golden west in which
<br/>his sun sinks, and, sinking, casts back a glory upon the leaden cloud-
<br/>rack which had darkly besieged his day.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After all, the body is a more expert dialectician than the soul, and
<br/>buffets it, even to bewilderment, with the empty bladders of logic;
<br/>but the soul can retire, from the dust and turmoil of such conflict, to
<br/>the high tower of instinctive faith, and there, in hushed serenity, take
<br/>comfort of the sympathizing stars. We look at death through the
<br/>cheap-glazed windows of the flesh, and believe him for the monster
<br/>which the flawed and crooked glass presents him. You say truly that
<br/>we have wasted time in trying to coax the body into a faith in what, by
<br/>its very nature, it is incapable of comprehending. Hence, a plethoric,
<br/>short-winded kind of belief, that can walk at an easy pace over the
<br/>smooth plain, but loses breath at the first sharp uphill of life. How
<br/>idle is it to set a sensual bill of fare before the soul, acting over again
<br/>the old story of the Crane and the Fox!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>These Conversations cannot fail to prove a permanent ad-
<br/>dition to our national literature. For although their pro-
<br/>-fessed subject is one of the most hackneyed that could be cho-
<br/>-sen; yet they contain as much freshness and beauty as though
<br/>it were now handled for the first time.</p>

AMERICAN PROSE WRITERS.
NO. 3.
JOHN WATERS.
</p>
         <p>John Waters is well entitled to a place in the catalogue
<br/>of American prose writers. Mr. Griswold has given him a
<br/>niche among our poets, but he will be known better by his
<br/>essays than his poems. In one respect he is like Charles
<br/>Lamb; the best part of his life has been devoted to business;
<br/>the Phenix bank, of which he was president many years,
<br/>contains the largest amount of his writings, as the India
<br/>House does of Lamb’s. We are not aware that John Waters
<br/>has ever appeared before the public with a book, but his in-
<br/>-dividuality is as well defined, and he stands apart from
<br/>other writers as distinctly as Elia did before his essays were
<br/>published in a separate volume.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It would be unjust to compare him with Lamb, as we
<br/>have heard done, for their style and habits of thought are
<br/>quite different. In fastidiousness of tastes, a reverence for
<br/>the past and a delicacy of appetite, there is considerable re-
<br/>-semblance between these two authors, but in other respects
<br/>they are widely different. A looseness of religious sentiment
<br/>pervades the writings of Elia, but you discern upon a very
<br/>short acquaintance with John Waters, that his religious faith
<br/>is as sharply defined, and as positive as his taste in fish or
<br/>wine, and that he would frown upon heterodoxy in the
<br/>church as severely as he would upon a blunder in carving,
<br/>whether in marble or mutton. His essays are all short, as
<br/>essays should be, of the Addisonian dimensions and density
<br/>of expression. His sentences are the most perfect in the lan-
<br/>-guage; it would be a vain task to hunt through them all for
<br/>a superfluous conjunction. They are too perfect to be pecu-
<br/>-liar, for writers are distinguished from each other more by
<br/>their faults than their excellencies. He is manifestly an ad-
<br/>-mirer of Geoffrey Crayon, but very far from an imitator of
<br/>his style. He has a finer artistic taste than the author of the
<br/>Sketch Book, but a less genial love of nature, as nature.
<br/>He can endure nothing that wears a slovenly aspect. His
<br/>lawns must be neatly trimmed and his gardens weeded.
<br/>He abhors Scuppernon wine, but can relish port in chowder.
<br/>He has not written much about flowers, but we should think
<br/>that his favorite was a Camelia. He is in some sort a Sam
<br/>Rogers, but more particular. In pictures he is an admirer
<br/>of Both and Weir. Probably Gerard Douw and Watteau are
<br/>among his great artists. His humor is of the quiet kind
<br/>which provokes a bland smile, but never a laugh, which
<br/>would be irregular and boisterous. His piety is tender and
<br/>subduing, it may cause a tear, but never a swelling of the
<br/>heart. He is rather fanciful than imaginative, and the pictures
<br/>which he presents to us are exhibited through a stained glass,
<br/>which mellows the outlines without distorting the forms re-
<br/>-presented. His descriptions have a delicacy of finish like
<br/>the carvings of Grinling Gibbons. They remind you as for-
<br/>-cibly of nature as anything short of nature can, but they
<br/>never deceive you; you know all the while that it is not a
<br/>reality that affects you.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We are not familiar with any of his writings, but those
<br/>that have appeared in the New York American and in the
<br/>Knickerbocker. They should be collected together in a vol-
<br/>-ume by themselves; for they would make a valuable addi-
<br/>-tion to our national literature. We need them as models of
<br/>style, in these days of rhodomontades and Macaulayisms.
<br/>John Waters is a sensualist, rather than a sentimentalist.
<br/>Perhaps he thinks otherwise. But his sensualism is a senti-
<br/>-ment. The greater part of his essays are purely sensual,
<br/>although it is not a vulgar sensualism, but rather a spiritual</p>
         <p/>
         <p>appetite of the senses. He elevates a buttered muffin into a
<br/>work of high art; and his fish are such exquisite creatures,
<br/>that you feel while gazing upon them, that Vatel may be
<br/>pardoned for falling upon his sword. There is always some-
<br/>-thing to be tasted, or smelt or listened to in his essays. The
<br/>mouth is more apt to water than the eyes, in his company.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>John Waters is only an assumed name, as all the world
<br/>knows, like that of Christopher North, Barry Cornwall, Geof-
<br/>-frey Crayon, and others. The real name of this pure essay-
<br/>-ist is Henry Cary. He is at present we believe a gentleman
<br/>of wealth and leisure. With a keen relish for elegant liter-
<br/>-ature and refined art, he appears to have had the prudence
<br/>to labor diligently through his early years in acquiring a for-
<br/>-tune, that his later life might be spent in the quiet of inde-
<br/>-pendent ease. Pity, pity, that many of similar taste were
<br/>not endowed with similar prudence and forethought!</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We give a short extract from one of his papers in the
<br/>Knickerbocker containing an account of the great Hungarian
<br/>pianist Lizst, who, we have reason to believe, we shall have
<br/>among us during the year.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“Our nice travelling chariot, with all its trunks, cases, pockets,
<br/>down-cushions, and delightful appliances, that we had thought such a
<br/>purchase two days before at Frankfort, gave out just as we approach-
<br/>-ed Heidelberg. One of the axletrees heated, the wheel refused to
<br/>turn round, and for two hours we were standing in the road, surrounded
<br/>by peasantry that the postillion had assembled together, endeavoring
<br/>to get the wheel oil, pouring cold water upon it, and talking to us
<br/>and about us in an unknown tongue; for although my friend and my-
<br/>-self mustered five modern languages, German unfortunately was not
<br/>one of them, and we knew nothing whatever of the patois of these
<br/>honest people.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>After consultation with a mechanic at Heidelberg, and finding that
<br/>the defect was not to be remedied there without great delay, we re-
<br/>-solved upon a partial repair, and to return as best we might to Frank-
<br/>-fort and seek redress from the warranty of the party of whom we had
<br/>bought the vehicle. We paid our visit to the incomparable ruins of
<br/>the castle, and then proceeded to retrace our steps; and examining
<br/>our wheels at every post-house, reached the Hotel d’Angleterre at
<br/>Frankfort at the close of day in August last.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It is always depressing to be turned back upon one’s path; and
<br/>these reclamations and bargainings for redress are the most uncomfor-
<br/>table things in the world; so that M. and I looked blank at one ano-
<br/>-ther as we entered again the streets of that busy mart. We determined
<br/>to say nothing of the matter until mornihg, and I longed heartily for
<br/>some refreshment that should banish it altogether from my mind in
<br/>the mean time.</p>
         <p>‘Is there no music in Frankfort to-night?' I inquired.
‘I beg your pardon,’ was the reply; ‘there is, the finest. Monsieur
Liszt, the pianist, performs this evening at the theatre.’
‘Is it far from this?’
‘Quite the contrary, fortunately, for the performances must have
begun.’
‘Show me the way.’
</p>
         <p>In a few minutes I had passed through the boxes into the pit of a
<br/>small theatre. It was well filled, and yet the number of performers
<br/>and amateurs on the stage seemed hardly less than that of the audience.
<br/>The entertainment had opened, and was continned for some time with
<br/>alternate instrumental and vocal music. The latter was composed of
<br/>those strong brassy, male voices, that satisfy the ear by their correct-ness and force, perhaps, but make no approach toward the heart</p>
         <p/>
         <p>There was then a pause of some minutes, and a movement of ex-
<br/>-pectation throughout the house; and presently a pale-faced, light-com-
<br/>plexioned, loosely-constructed, middle-aged person made his way
<br/>through the artists and assistants, saluted the audience in a shambling
<br/>and gauche manner, and seated himself without notes at a piano that
<br/>was near the front of the stage.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Until he reached the side of this instrument, he seemed like part of
<br/>a man, wanting support and confidence; but as he took his place, the
<br/>existence became complete, and joy passed over his countenance as he
<br/>laid his hand upon the keys. It was one of the faces of Thorwaldsen,
<br/>an express indication of the deep interior spirit; and expectation rose
<br/>high when the piano breathed as it were under his touch. He ran
<br/>through a delicious voluntary, that there might be no doubt of the ex-
<br/>-actness of each note, and we all felt the perfection of his fingering;
<br/>clear, distinct, round, precious, full—a shower of pearls upon a table
<br/>of porphyry.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was now all stillness, the intense stillness of watchfulness,
<br/>throughout the house; for his performance was to commence; and al-
<br/>though the moment if measured by a clock might have been short, no
<br/>doubt, we divided time by a different metre; and a wild waste had in
<br/>our imagination extended itself around him, when he calmly raised his
<br/>hands to their utmost height, and with blow after blow upon the in-
<br/>-strument with his whole force, successively planted large columnar
<br/>masses of sound over the extended plain, and a scene like that of the
<br/>Giant’s Causeway rose like enchantment before our astonished and de-
<br/>-lighted senses. Hardly had he sketched the vision before us, when a
<br/>storm began such as I have seldom witnessed. The instrument rained,
<br/>hailed, thundered, moaned, whistled, shrieked round those basaltic co-
<br/> lumns, in every cry that the tempest can utter in its wildest paroxysms
<br/>of wrath. It was almost too powerful and ungoverned at the last; and</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p56"/>
         </p>
         <p>at the instant that this thought entered into the mind, the wind lulled,
<br/>the elements were spent, the calm came; the brooks and water-courses
<br/>took up their song of exultation; the air was refreshed, the birds chirp-
<br/>-ed, the sun put forth, and the 'young leaf lifted its green head.’</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We now accompanied him through a small valley with precipitous
<br/>banks, such as one finds in Piedmont, where the large leafed tree
<br/>grows beside the mossy rock, and the vine tries vainly to envelope
<br/>both, and shade and light and repose are the glory of the earth. Young
<br/>clouds were forming on the upper heights, destined to paint the skies of
<br/>Italy, and struggled hard in their ascent at every jutting rock and leafy
<br/>buttress to remain adhering to their native cliffs, against the repeated
<br/>bidding of the sun; as if preferring even to the cerulean heaven, a world
<br/>so verdant and so fair! We were thus borne along by the strain
<br/>through countless beauties of rock and sky and foliage to a grotto, by
<br/>the side of which was a fountain that seemed one of the Eyes of the
<br/>Earth, so large and darkly-brilliant was it, so deep and so serene;
<br/>reflecting on its retina with magical distinctness every surround-
<br/>ing object, whether distant or near. Here we listened for some mo-
<br/>-ments to the voices rather than the songs of birds, when the music by
<br/>degrees again diminished, and then fluttered and then ceased.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It was not immediately that the audience gave forth their demon-
<br/>strations of rapturous applause; and as I looked round, I saw on all
<br/>sides that 'eyes, in tears, both smiled and wept' I walked home al-
<br/>-most upon air, and every pulsation on the way was a throb of gratitude
<br/>to Him, who for our solace and delight hath 'planted the ear' and
<br/>opened all hearts to the inspiration of the truly gifted master of this
<br/>wonderful art.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Thus far, dear editor, is the extract, which world never have been
<br/>offered to your regard, but that being some days afterward in the so-
<br/>-ciety of an accomplished lady, herself no mean musician, and descri-
<br/>-bing to her the effect produced on my mind by this remarkable per-
<br/>-formance, she surprised me by saying that she bad been present at it,
<br/>and that the same imagery had passed with slight variation before her
<br/>as she listened, that I have here endeavored faintly to preserve.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I was charmed at the assurance, for it confirmed me in the belief
<br/>that this was not the mere flitting of the rainbow spirit across the
<br/>imagination, rearing in its passage a fabric of happiness—beautiful at
<br/>times as a palace of the Genii, and, alas! as illusory—but a substan-
<br/>-tive and truthful joy, to be recalled at will; to be remembered in
<br/>solitude; to be dwelt upon for the enrichment of the soul; and—may
<br/>I entertain the hope?—in some degree perhaps even to be imparted.”</p>
         <p>John Waters.
CHRONOLOGY.
THE ORIGIN OF MANHATTAN, HELL GATE, ETC.
</p>
         <p>It is characteristic of the American people to look forward,
<br/>and indulge in anticipations of the future—probably because
<br/>the most brilliant prospects attract the mind in contemplating
<br/>the rise and development of the nation. We have nothing
<br/>to allege against so natural a trait. Hope beckons on the
<br/>course of nations, as well as of ambitious and noble-minded
<br/>individuals. But we propose, just now, to cast a moment’s
<br/>retrospect, and to look back—it is not a very long vista, at
<br/>most—to the verge of our early history on the continent.
<br/>The time is not very remote, when ships came doubtingly
<br/>out of the Atlantic mists on our coasts, from the leading
<br/>ports of Europe, and, after a furtive recognition of the “wild
<br/>men,” found here, dropped anchor in our roadsteads, and the
<br/>mouths of our larger rivers. Wonder sat depicted in the
<br/>countenances of every master and mate of a vessel, who got
<br/>into a pinnace to land, and kept his two eyes on a restless
<br/>stretch for new objects, and he moved his tiller with adroit
<br/>ease, from one side to the other.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>It may be doubted, indeed, whether Shakspeare did not
<br/>draw the scenes of his “Tempest” from the first narra-
<br/>-tives of wondering voyagers, who came to America, and who
<br/>were prone to see on every cliff a “Caliban,” or something
<br/>worse, or more fantastic, in the shape of an Indian. Bear in
<br/>mind, gentle reader, that the Scandinavians saw here the
<br/>“Unipedes”—that singular race of the human family who
<br/>went, with somewhat of the nervous emphasis of a Kanga-
<br/>-roo, on one foot. This was certainly an improvement on the
<br/>ancient notion of the people of Kaethay, as reported by the
<br/>veritable Joseph Barberat and Marco Polo, who affirmed, that
<br/>all other nations besides themselves, had but one eye. To
<br/>have but one leg was the greater wonder of the two.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Be these questions as they may, and there is room for his-
<br/>-toriographers and physiologists to say a great deal on both
<br/>sides, it is just two hundred and thirty-six years—not a</p>
         <p/>
         <p>whit more, since the first ship of the bold and adventurous
<br/>Hollander first cast anchor in the noble bay which is now
<br/>called New York. The area of Broadway, from which we
<br/>issue this sheet, like some other spots hereabout, was then
<br/>occupied by the scattered wigwams of a gaunt, fierce-look-
<br/>ing race of men, with piercing black eyes, and black hair,
<br/>who walked about with bows and arrows, and called them-
<br/>-selves Manhattans. We humor orthography, by letting the
<br/>word stand, as our Dutch ancestors wrote it, albeit, we could
<br/>easily prove that they retrenched some of the true original,
<br/>and gave it a twist to suit their own notions of the laws of
<br/>recording sound.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Manhattan, (with this salvo,) was the name for a noted
<br/>whirlpool in the vicinity, which the Dutch called Hellegat,
<br/>and which we, taking the same right to twist it that the
<br/>Dutch did to twist Man-a-ha-tan-uk, call Hellgate. It is only
<br/>our Eastern neighbors, by the way, who have ever been
<br/>noted, especially in their discussions on theology, for steering
<br/>clear of so hard a place, or eschewing it, at least from a
<br/>choice in their terminology, that call this remarkable pass
<br/>Hurlgate. By the ancient Manhattanese, it was simply de-
<br/>-scribed, as a place of violent, or bad whirling waters, just
<br/>indeed, what it is. And as it is by far the most striking
<br/>and characteristic geographical trait in the vicinity of New
<br/>York, they called the island, on its west, Manhattan Island,
<br/>while that on its east, was Metoacs, [Long Island.] These
<br/>sons of the forest were no deep philosophers, and did not set
<br/>themselves down to consider why and wherefore all things
<br/>should be done. They smoked their pipes, and never once
<br/>thought of philology, or ethnography, or any other word, that
<br/>might help men, two hundred and thirty-six years afterwards,
<br/>to trace ties of affinities, physical or moral. They were con-
<br/>-tent to call themselves the people of Manhattan Island—that
<br/>is to say, the people of the whirlpool. Here is both good
<br/>history and sound philology, and should the reader like it, we
<br/>may, perchance, tell him, hereafter, who these ancient Man-
<br/>-hattanese were, and how they danced, and roved, and whoop-
<br/>-ed, and cut all sorts of savage antics, on the very spots where
<br/>theatres, and churches, and exchanges, and great hotels are
<br/>now erected,—aye, they were not afraid to worship the devil
<br/>himself, on the identical place where the most “tried” bish-
<br/>ops, now rule or abide.	H. R. S.</p>
         <p>SINGULAR ANECDOTE OF A CAT.
</p>
         <p>During a hard snow storm last winter, a kitten with a
<br/>broken leg hopped into the hall door of a gentleman’s house
<br/>in Brooklyn, and began a piteous mewing. He ordered one
<br/>of the servants to throw the kitten into the street, when his
<br/>little daughter, a lovely child of eight years, caught it in her
<br/>arms and begged to be allowed to keep it and nurse it.
<br/>The father refused, but the child begged so earnestly that
<br/>he at last allowed her to keep it.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The child nursed her pet until it got well, and the cat, un-
<br/>-like the majority of its species, returned all the fondness of
<br/>its gentle nurse.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>A few weeks since the little girl took sick and was con-
<br/>-fined to her bed, and it was almost impossible to keep the
<br/>cat away from her. As the child grew sicker the cat grew
<br/>more troublesome, by mewing and constantly jumping upon
<br/>the bed where she lay. It was impossible to drive her out
<br/>of the room, until at last, the child being near her end, the
<br/>cat stretched herself out near the bed and appeared to be
<br/>dying; it was taken into an adjoining room and put upon a
<br/>rug. “Take care of my poor kitten,” said the little girl, as
<br/>she saw them take it away.</p>
         <p>In a few hours the child died, and when they went into
the adjoining room the cat lay dead upon the rug.

         <p>We gave last week a column or two to the peculiarities of Mr. Willis as a prose writer; we present the public this
<br/>week with a full-length portrait of that popular author, together with one of his popular coadjutor, which represents
<br/>them at their favorite Mirror. We have represented them in this manner, because their names are so identified with the
<br/>Mirror, that, without it, no likeness of them could be considered perfect. The Brigadier, for a similar reason, is repre-
<br/>-sented in his epaulettes. For the last twenty years he has been known to the New York public, as the Colonel, or the
<br/>General. At his Benefit, the other night, we observed that he was called in the bills, George P. Morris, Esq. It was
<br/>the first time that we ever saw those mysterious letters, E.S.Q. attached to his name. We did what we could for his
<br/>benefit then, and we hope that our endeavors now will be in some manner beneficial to him.</p>
         <p>The names of Morris and Willis have been too long associated together to admit of their being parted in an illustration.

Original Poetry.
NOW IS ALWAYS BEST.
Dreamy river of the Past,
Flowing into darkness slowly,
Many a blossom I have cast
On thy waters, now made holy
By an idle melancholy;
Give me but a leaflet back,
Though quite wilted, ere thy track
Shall be lost in midnight wholly!
Give me one, I ask no more,
Though it be but from the store
Of some childish, by-gone folly!
Ah me! in a heavy mood,
Such as I to-night am bearing,
Any thing that’s past is good;
All the present is but caring,
All the future more despairing,
And the past is sweet alone,
Where, although the sun be gone,
Half the sky is warm with wearing
His last kiss, and in the East
A faint glow, of lights the least,
Tells that moon-rise is preparing.
When was ever joy like thine,
Whose memory, even, is juvenescent?
Then my blood was more than wine,
Then I slumbered like a peasant,
Then my hope was like a crescent
That could never come to full,
Then, if ever, life looked dull,
Dulness must for once be pleasant,
Then my heart so lightly beat
That the sunshine seemed more sweet
Even for being evanescent.
Idle fancies! would I change
The hard present, with its swinking,
With its hopes of broader range,
Past and Future strangely linking
By their privilege of thinking,—
Would I change it for their Old,
Which, for all its cups of gold,
Gives us but poor dregs for drinking?
Would I change it for the past?
Make ease first, and labor last?
Out on such unmanly shrinking!
Mine the Present! That is best,
Let what will have gone before it;
Here my heart shall build her nest,
With green leaves to rustle o’er it;
When there’s sunshine, she shall store it
As the moss does, ’gainst the hour
When the clouds come into power,
And from her own garners pour it
All around, until the sun
Come again, ere half’s outrun,
And with tenfold grace restore it.
After both are over and gone,
What care I for sun or shower?
While there’s earth to stand upon,
Spite of both the heart can flower;
In herself is all her power;
Fancy, too, can build a home
Higher than where change can come,
And the soul hath still her dower
Of high faith and purpose vast,
Where, though earth in night be cast,
She waits firm as in a tower.
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.
AN EPIGRAM,
On Certain Conservatives.
In olden days men’s ears were docked
For thinking, and for other crimes;
And now, some worthies overstocked
With these commodities are shocked
At the false mercy of the times,
Which spoils their chance of being shortened
In their own feature most important.
The Fine Arts.
</p>
         <p>Horace Kneeland, the sculptor, has in his studio in the
<br/>Granite Building corner of Chambers street and Broadway,
<br/>two remarkably fine busts, which for integrity of expression
<br/>are equal to any that we have seen by Powers. They are
<br/>of Professor Mapes and Captain Ericcson: the first is in mar-
<br/>-ble. Mr. Kneeland only requires to be more extensively
<br/>known to be more fully employed. He should go to Rome,
<br/>for the name of it; for his countrymen cannot bring them-
<br/>-selves to believe that an American can attain to anything
<br/>like respectability in Art without breathing the atmosphere
<br/>of Italy. Powers owes much of his reputation to the com-
<br/>-mendation of the Italians. This is hardly a matter of re-
<br/>-proach to his countrymen; for we have so few works of Art
<br/>amongst us, that we are not capable of judging of the rela-
<br/>-tive merit of an artist, when compared with the great mas-
<br/>-ters in Art. It takes a long while for common observers to
<br/>appreciate any work of Art that is merely natural and sim-
<br/>-ple. If the Theseus or Antinous were set up at the corner
<br/>of one of our streets, we doubt whether it would attract
<br/>many admirers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The American Art-Union have selected for the subject of
<br/>their next engraving, a picture by Durand, in the possession
<br/>of Mr. Paulding, representing the capture of Major Andre.</p>
         <p>The Drama.
</p>
         <p>A good natured friend, who seems to labor under a very
<br/>erroneous impression, that we have an idea of setting the
<br/>North River on fire, has entirely misunderstood the meaning
<br/>of our initial remarks on the Theatres. We desire first to
<br/>disabuse his mind in respect to the incendiary motives with
<br/>which he has charged us, and next, to assure him that we
<br/>only meant that our remarks on the Theatre should apply to
<br/>the consideration in which the Theatre has always been held
<br/>by that portion of the community in England and America,
<br/>whom the world call religious. The Theatre has long held
<br/>an anomalous position among Englishmen. There is very
<br/>little difference between Great Britain and America, in this
<br/>respect, and our remarks are meant for both countries. The
<br/>critic of the Mirror, asked the other day, “Are our Theatres
<br/>worthy of support?" But that is not the important question.
<br/>Why are they not? is the great question. We said that
<br/>the Theatre had not been a reputable profession since the
<br/>time of Queen Elizabeth. This our friend disputes. But we
<br/>cannot fix upon any point when it has been so considered.
<br/>It was not in Dryden's time; it was not in Addison’s; it was
<br/>not in Garrick’s; it was not in Sheridan’s. Assuredly, it has
<br/>not been since. In Garrick’s time, the Church of Scotland
<br/>expelled one of its ministers for writing a tragedy; an earl
<br/>disowned his daughter for marrying a player, who was in
<br/>other respects, an estimable man. There is not a clergyman
<br/>in New York, who would dare to be seen in one of our Thea-
<br/>-tres, with his family. Yet clergymen go with their families
<br/>to the Concert-room, and other places of purely idle amuse-
<br/>-ment, without fear of reproach. In France, where the Drama
<br/>is a national amusement, and the Theatres are partly sup-
<br/>-ported from the public treasury, actors were long denied
<br/>Christian burial, and even Moliere, was refused this sacred
<br/>rite by a churlish priest. There is a reason for the odium
<br/>which attaches to the Theatre, and it is worth inquiring into.
<br/>It is a very easy thing, but not always safe, to charge those
<br/>with ignorance who happen to differ with you in opinion; or
<br/>charge one with putting a match to the North River, when
<br/>he only walked down to the shore to bathe his hands. We</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p59"/>
thought that our friend’s magazine of mischief was stored
with harder missiles than these cheap witticisms.
</p>
         <p>We cut the following seemingly just remarks on the drama
<br/>from an essay on Landscape Painting in a late English publi-
<br/>-cation.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>“It will be acknowledged at once that, of all modes of rendering an
<br/>imitation of an event, the stage possesses the greatest power. It has
<br/>the advantage of uniting the concentrated capabilities of painting,
<br/>poetry, and music. Instead of being limited, like painting, to the
<br/>representation of one moment of time, and those incidents out of the
<br/>many which took place only in such moment, the mind is prepared by
<br/>a continued run of events, for the development of some grand burst
<br/>of tragedy—the poetry uttered by the choicest language of passion,
<br/>the picture formed of living man, under the highest emotion, and re-
<br/>-lieved upon a back ground of music, rushing in harmonious surges, or
<br/>gliding through thrilling melodies, from one appropriate and sustaining
<br/>character of pathos to another, as the subject may demand.”</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The difficulties of dramatic representation are owing to
<br/>these very causes which the author considers its advantage.
<br/>Poetry, music, and painting are entirely distinct arts, and can
<br/>lend no aid to each other. If Ole Bul had been surrounded by
<br/>a panorama of Niagara Falls in his late performance, wherein
<br/>he aimed at conveying by sound, an idea of the cataract, he
<br/>could never have succeeded in impressing his audience with
<br/>an idea of the real scene—the eye would have been continually
<br/>breaking in upon the abstraction of the ear. But the greatest
<br/>disadvantage in dramatic representation, arises from the ne-
<br/>-cessity of employing real men as actors, while all around
<br/>them is artificial. The incongruity arising from this necessity
<br/>will always prevent a perfect illusion, in a dramatic perform-
<br/>-ance. The Greeks, by giving to the persons of their drama,
<br/>the appearance of artificial men and women by covering their
<br/>faces with masks, and rejecting all attempts at scenic illusion,
<br/>produced effects of terror and mirth, which the modem stage,
<br/>with all its aids, has never been able to accomplish. The
<br/>Greek women were certainly not more effeminate than the
<br/>delicate ladies of our own time; yet we hear of no swoonings
<br/>at our Theatres, such as took place in the time of AEschylus;
<br/>when, as Miss Barrett says,</p>
         <p>"The women swooned to see so awful.”
</p>
         <p>Garrick played Hamlet in a bob-wig and laced coat, and
<br/>produced an impression which none of his successors have
<br/>been able to do, with all the aids of black velvet and glass
<br/>beads. It would really be less offensive to good taste to see
<br/>Hamlet personated by a player in a coat and pantaloons, than
<br/>in the dress in which he is now presented. This being a
<br/>thinking age, and a searching age, two thirds of any audi-
<br/>-ence mnst feel the absurdity of dressing a Danish prince of
<br/>the supposed time of Hamlet, in the fancy gear which actors
<br/>generally wear. We have seen actresses personate Ophelia
<br/>with tropical flowers in their hair in the mad scene. There
<br/>is no reason why the stage should not be as perfect in its re-
<br/>-presentations of nature and society as any other department
<br/>of art. Macready wears a dress in Macbeth which all the
<br/>wealth of Scotland could not have purchased in the days o
<br/>the Thane of Cawdor. The barbarisms committed by Mac-
<br/>-beth and his wife, are utterly repugnant to the refinement of
<br/>their apparel. In the banquet scene the tables are generally
<br/>set out with dishes of pine-apples and oranges; in a climate
<br/>where carraways and pippins have never been heard of.</p>
         <p>OPERAS AND CONCERTS.
</p>
         <p>After a short, but highly successful, musical season, we
<br/>are likely, it seems, to be left entirely to our own resources
<br/>for our musical entertainments. The English Opera compa-
<br/>-ny have left us for the South, after having coined dollars by
<br/>the thousands; and the Italian company, it is currently re-
<br/>-ported, is bound under engagement to proceed at once to
<br/>New Orleans. This last item, however, we look upon as</p>
         <p/>
         <p>mere hear-say, or probably a lure thrown out by the friends
<br/>of the artists to accelerate the in-coming of subscriptions for
<br/>another season. But, whether it be true or not, there cannot
<br/>be a doubt but that the absence of Pico and Borghese will
<br/>prove a terrible blow to the amusement of the “Upper Ten
<br/>Thousand.” Into what channel the intensely concentrated
<br/>enthusiasm of this discriminating class will flow, it is impos-
<br/>-sible to predict; but we believe that the turning of a hair
<br/>would transfer this variable stream to the Park theatre, now
<br/>that the mere bipeds have been driven forth to seek their
<br/>bread, and are judiciously succeeded by the more sagacious,
<br/>whose wants are carefully attended to, particularly the food.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We greatly distrust this violent and sudden excitement
<br/>about the Italian Opera. It is not the expression of a discri-
<br/>-minating and healthy public appreciation, but it is rather the
<br/>fussy clamor of a set or clique, with no further end in view
<br/>than the passing away of idle hours, combined with affected
<br/>display of dress and fashion. We are by no means opposed
<br/>to the establishing of an Italian opera here, but we have lit-
<br/>-tle faith in it as a means of aiding the cause of music, or of
<br/>musical taste. We shall probably discuss this subject more
<br/>fully in a future number.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Borghese and Pico have had their benefits in the fullest
<br/>sense of the word. On each occasion the house was crowd-
<br/>-ed in every part. Hundreds of dollars were expended upon
<br/>bushel baskets of flowers, and Borghese circulated among the
<br/>audience an envious imitation of the Carrier’s New Year’s
<br/>address, in which her patrons (oh! artistical degradation!)
<br/>were lauded with the usual amount of flummery. We look
<br/>upon this as altogether a very notable piece of absurdity,
<br/>even exceeding the usual limits assigned to a beneficiary.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The success of the English Opera at the Park Theatre has
<br/>been more to our satisfaction, for the reason that its efforts
<br/>are more beneficial to the mass. The circle of its influence
<br/>is more extended, and the solace of its charms falls upon a
<br/>class which needs most greatly this softening and refining
<br/>amusement.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Music is a necessity to the rich, for custom has made it so,
<br/>and heavy-footed time has strengthened the custom; but
<br/>music is a luxury to the poor—whose luxuries are few—and
<br/>that which will tend however remotely to ameliorate the
<br/>condition, or sweeten the labor of those who struggle with
<br/>the world, should always demand our earliest attention and
<br/>warmest advocacy.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Madame Arnoult’s Concert.—This lady made her first
<br/>appearance before a New York audience on Friday the 17th
<br/>inst. at the Tabernacle. The weather was very much against
<br/>her: it stormed all the day, and persisted in wearing an ap-
<br/>-pearance of gloom and discomfort, long after the hour ap-
<br/>-pointed for the commencement of the concert. The audience
<br/>assembled, in number eight or nine hundred, was possibly
<br/>the most fashionable ever seen in the Tabernacle. We no-
<br/>-ticed the heads of most of the sterling families in the city,—
<br/>proving how warm an interest is taken in the best circles, in
<br/>the good cause of this worthy lady.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Madame Pico, Signora Borghese, Signori Antognini, San-
<br/>quirico, Tomasi, with Messrs. Etienne and J. A. Kyle, as-
<br/>-sisted on this occasion, and, as the bills state, gave their ser-
<br/>-vices to Madame Arnoult.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The fair beneficiary comes before us in a doubtful light—
<br/>doubtful, we mean, as regards her liability to suffer our cri-
<br/>-ticism. She has hitherto exercised her vocal abilities for the
<br/>amusement of her friends. She now comes before the public
<br/>to redeem the fortunes of her husband, but whether or not
<br/>she has finally adopted music as her profession, we are not
<br/>informed. We will, however, make a few remarks upon her</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p60"/>
         </p>
         <p>capacity, as evidenced upon this occasion. She has a light
<br/>soprano voice of good compass, but of moderate power. Her
<br/>intonation is generally good, her execution is very neat and
<br/>rapid, her voice being very flexible, while her enunciation is
<br/>distinct. Yet with all these good points, she has much to
<br/>learn, ere she can become an efficient public performer.
<br/>There is a want of a decided style, a want of emphasis and
<br/>energy—in short, a want of those essentials which, though
<br/>trifling to name, are of the utmost consequence to a public
<br/>singer. However, with good care and judicious advice, Ma-
<br/>-dame Arnoult will, ere long, have little to fear. May she
<br/>go on and prosper.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Most of the other artists are too well known to the public
<br/>to need our comment upon the present occasion. We will
<br/>however say, that Mr. Kyle’s solo on the flute, was played
<br/>most charmingly,—with taste, brilliancy and expression.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>General Morris’s Complementary Concert.—This gen-
<br/>-erous testimony to Mr. Morris as a man and worthy citizen,
<br/>fully equalled, in its results, the expectations of the friendly
<br/>projectors. We are told that he netted some two thousand
<br/>dollars. He was called out between the parts, and responded
<br/>to the call in a few words neatly turned;—he would have
<br/>said more, but his heart rose to his throat, and his honeyed
<br/>words were distilled into tears, and he retired.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Some of our contemporaries have shown a disposition to
<br/>question the claims of the General to a Complimentary Be-
<br/>-nefit. But those who gave their services on the occasion
<br/>should be allowed to be the best judges. Those who attend-
<br/>-ed the concert certainly got the worth of their money; and
<br/>let the General’s claims have been what they might, he need
<br/>feel under no obligations to his audience. The silly custom
<br/>of throwing bouquets at ladies on the stage, should never be
<br/>practised by an audience pretending to the smallest degree of
<br/>refinement. If the money which these kind of compliments
<br/>cost was enclosed to the beneficiary, it would no doubt be in-
<br/>-finitely more acceptable than in the shape of faded camelias.</p>
         <p>PLACES WORTH VISITING.
</p>
         <p>The sights best worth seeing in New York, may be visited
<br/>free of cost. This is an important fact, which strangers, in
<br/>particular, are not aware of, and they waste a good deal of
<br/>time and money in sight-seeing, with but little pleasure, or
<br/>profit to themselves, for the lack of a suitable guide to the
<br/>places really worth visiting.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The upper part of the city, particularly in the avenues west
<br/>of Broadway, has always something new to attract a stran-
<br/>-ger, and even a citizen, in the shape of an Italian villa, or a
<br/>Gothic church. These architectural exhalations are continu-
<br/>-ally rising from the earth i this part of the town, and if they
<br/>are not always elegant, they are always novel. It is a well
<br/>known fact in natural history, that where an oak forest is
<br/>cut down, a pine forest springs up in its place. The soil of
<br/>Manhattan Island possesses some peculiarity akin to that on
<br/>which oaken forests grow. Wherever an old Dutch house
<br/>is pulled down, a Gothic church is almost certain to spring
<br/>up in its place. It is our intention to give engravings of all
<br/>these new churches and villas; but our arrangements for that
<br/>purpose are not yet entirely completed to our satisfaction.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>One of the most enchanting places, at this season, is Thor-
<br/>burn’s flower depot, in John street; apart from his picture
<br/>gallery, which alone is worth visiting, his bow-window,
<br/>formed of the purest plate glass, is the great point of attrac-
<br/>-tion. Here may be seen the latest chrysanthemums, and the
<br/>earliest hyacinths; a rare cactus of some kind is always in
<br/>bloom, and the whitest of camelias here open their delicate</p>
         <p/>
         <p>petals; here, too, of a forenoon, may be seen every day, a
<br/>collection of bouquets, which will be exhibited in the evening
<br/>by some young lady, to an exclusive circle only. Mr. Thor-
<br/>burn must be a benevolent hearted man, to make so precious
<br/>an exhibition for the benefit of the public, without charging
<br/>them any thing in return. A churl would not do so good
<br/>natured an act.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Daguerrian galleries are very attractive places, and we
<br/>do not know of a more agreeable room to while away an
<br/>idle hour in, than the Plumbe establishment, on the corner of
<br/>Barclay street. The rooms are well fitted up, the proprietors
<br/>gentlemanly and obliging, and their collection of authentic
<br/>portraits of people whom one would like to know, very ex-
<br/>-tensive. The workmen in this establishment are artists,
<br/>who will not allow an imperfect likeness to leave their hands.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Mr. Coleman has a fine collection of curious books, which
<br/>he is always happy to exhibit to the public free of cost. His
<br/>windows have a crowd about them in all weathers, and we
<br/>have seen many a pedestrian forget the rain, while looking
<br/>in at them; but the best things are to be seen inside. In
<br/>the upper part of his establishment he has fitted up a seclu-
<br/>-ded little nook, away from all noise and dust, which seems
<br/>always to be filled with sunshine, where a loiterer may
<br/>spend an entire day for a shilling. Here will be found some
<br/>very curious pictures, and a few very fine ones; among them
<br/>are an original by Hans Holbein, a landscape, by Ruysdael,
<br/>and a dying gladiator, by David. The walls are filled to
<br/>excess with works worth looking at; and there are but a
<br/>few not worthy of a place in a permanent gallery of art.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Bartlett &amp; Welford’s shop, in the Astor House, is another
<br/>seductive place for the lover of rarities in the shape of books.
<br/>Some of the finest illustrated works ever published, may be
<br/>here inspected free of charge, and purchased at prices greatly
<br/>below their first cost. These gentlemen are among the few
<br/>instances of traders in literature, who know something of the
<br/>articles they deal in. The senior partner is a good scholar,
<br/>and an accomplished ethnologist. Besides the fine collection
<br/>of old books to be found here, may be seen all the late French
<br/>and English publications that have any thing to recommend
<br/>them in the shape of illustrations.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The rooms of the American Art-Union, is another cheap
<br/>place of exhibition. Here may be found many works in
<br/>sculpture and painting, the productions of our young artists
<br/>who have not yet become sufficiently well-known to attract
<br/>visitors to their studios; and who avail themselves of the
<br/>opportunities afforded them by this excellent institution, to
<br/>make themselves known to the world. Among the works
<br/>now exhibited there, is an exceedingly fine landscape by
<br/>Cafferty, a young artist who promises to rise very high in his
<br/>profession.</p>
         <p>We shall resume this subject next week, and point out
many other places well worth visiting.
ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINES.
</p>
         <p>Godey’s Magazine and Lady’s Book, Edited by Mrs. Sarah J.
<br/>Hale, Morton M’Michael and Louis A. Godey, presents an imposing
<br/>array of Editors; but when taken in consideration with the list of
<br/>contributors, they are truly formidable. No less than ten ladies and
<br/>six gentlemen, besides the editors, have helped to fill the forty-six
<br/>pages of this magazine. Probably a much greater number of writers
<br/>than was ever employed on a single number of any of the great Re-
<br/>-views. But the great marvel is that so many writers should have been
<br/>able to produce so small an amount of readable matter. The only
<br/>article in the Magazine that will ever be read a second time, except
<br/>by the writers of them, is the New Arabian Nights’ Tale by Mr. Poe.
<br/>The idea of this tale is a very happy one, and it afforded the author a
<br/>wide scope for displaying his exact knowledge and lively imagina-</p>
         <p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p>
         <p>tion; two qualities that we rarely find united in the same person.
<br/>Scheherazade tells a new story, more wondrous than any that she had
<br/>related before, a continuation of Sinbad’s adventures, wherein are re-
<br/>-lated some of the modern discoveries in science, which startle the
<br/>king more than any of the doings of the Genii. At last, when the
<br/>narrator tells of women who wear artificial humps on their backs, he
<br/>grows impatient, and believing that his Queen is imposing upon his
<br/>credulity, orders her to be bow-strung. There are four engravings,
<br/>two in mezzotint, and two in line, one of them an old design of Cor-
<br/>bould’s from a worn-out plate, and the other a very sweetly tinted
<br/>picture of a sleeping child.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Graham’s Magazine of Literature and Art, Edited by the
<br/>proprietor, Geo. R. Graham, has but five ladies and thirteen gentle-
<br/>-men, for contributors to the February number. It has three engrav-
<br/>-ings, in line, and a something which is called a portrait of Edgar A.
<br/>Poe. It is poor as a work of art, and something much worse as a
<br/>portrait. It is a gross wrong to Mr. Poe, and a fraud upon the pur-
<br/>-chasers of the Magazine. It bears no more resemblance to that gen-
<br/>-tleman than to any other of Mr. Graham’s contributors. But if it were
<br/>much worse that it is, which is hardly conceivable, it would be amply
<br/>compensated by the fine sketch of Mr. Poe’s genius, by Lowell, which
<br/>accompanies it. The other engravings, excepting two wretched wood
<br/>cuts, are very commendable specimens of art; that of the Blackfeet
<br/>Indians, is the best that we have ever seen in this Magazine. There
<br/>are some remarks on domestic architecture, which, not being attribut-
<br/>-ed to any Contributor, we suppose are from the Editor’s pen; we have
<br/>rarely seen so many mistakes crowded into so small a space. The wri-
<br/>-ter thinks that Gothic Architecture is best adapted to our use, because,
<br/>“its dim religious light accords best with a Christian people.” A
<br/>plenty of light we should think accorded best with Christian feelings;
<br/>and a plenty of windows, and large ones too, is one of the marked
<br/>characteristics of the so-called Gothic style of Architecture. It was
<br/>only in Pagan Temples, that a dim religious light was considered
<br/>necessary.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Columbian Lady’s and Gentleman’s Magazine, Edited by
<br/>John Inman and Robert A. West, contains four engravings of which
<br/>we have already given an opinion. The plate of fashions for Februa-
<br/>-ry presents some very curious figures, particularly the gentleman in a
<br/>pink cravat, light green coat, dove colored trowsers and yellow kids.
<br/>A fashion plate, to be of any value, should be as exact as a table of
<br/>logarithms. By what process Mr. Post gets his fashions for February
<br/>three months in advance, we do not know, but we think it would be
<br/>rather unsafe for any of the ladies and gentlemen in the upper circles
<br/>to have their dresses made in the style of his plate, without further
<br/>advices from Paris. Trifles light as air, are to the fashionable confir-
<br/>-mation strong enough, when coming from Paris; but we have doubts
<br/>whether the firmans of Mr. Post have much weight in the fashionable
<br/>world. The contributors to this number, are seven ladies and seven
<br/>gentlemen. We see many names in both lists of great reputation,
<br/>but it was our sole design in this notice, to speak of these periodicals,
<br/>in reference to their decorations, and we are not therefore prepared to
<br/>pronounce judgment upon the merit of their papers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>These three magazines are so nearly alike, that if the covers were
<br/>changed, it would not be easy to distinguish one from the other.
<br/>They all have nearly the same contributors and the same embellish-
<br/>-ers. There are two of Chapman’s designs in the Columbian, and
<br/>one in Graham; and both have engravings from the same hands.
<br/>Magazines of this class are peculiar to the United States. Nothing
<br/>like them can be found in either England or France, saving La Belle
<br/>Assemblee, which, if published now, must have a very limited circula-
<br/>-tion. They tell a humiliating story for the public taste, and our at-
<br/>-tainments in art. Illustrated periodicals in England, France and Ger-
<br/>-many, are very abundant and very cheap. But it would be difficult to
<br/>find one in either country so poor in artistic design as either of these
<br/>magazines. The only method of illustration that has been employed
<br/>for many a year in Europe, in periodicals, has been by wood cuts.
<br/>And it is the only style of art that can be fitly employed with letter
<br/>press. In the infancy of the art, copper plates were employed from
<br/>necessity; but since the art of wood engraving has reached the per-
<br/>-fection which has distinguished it for the last twenty years, it has
<br/>gradually superseded all other kinds of illustration; and steel engrav-
<br/>-ings in a printed book are beginning to wear as incongruous an ap-
<br/>pearance as the gilding in old missals.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>These three magazines give us twelve plate engravings, without an
<br/>original thought, or a subject of the least interest, excepting the view
<br/>of Dr. Rose’s Villa, in Graham. They must have cost a good deal of</p>
         <p/>
         <p>money, and we have no doubt that, the half of it expended in the
<br/>encouragement of wood engraving from original designs, would have
<br/>procured illustrations which would have given double the satisfaction
<br/>that these smooth inanities will do. Once let the public get a taste of
<br/>good wood cuts, and these trifles will soon vanish. We trust that the
<br/>undertaking of our artists, to get out an illustrated edition of Bryant’s
<br/>Poems, which we gave a hint of in our last number, will give the
<br/>world an evidence that we can do something worth having in this im-
<br/>-portant department of art.</p>
         <p>LITERARY NOTICES.
</p>
         <p>The Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, D.D. late Head Master of
<br/>Rugby School, and Regius Professor of Modern History in the University
<br/>of Oxford. By Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, M. A. First American from the
<br/>third London Edition. D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1845. 1 vol. 12mo. pp. 516.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Dr. Arnold was one of the very few men whose death was felt to
<br/>be a loss to the world; and the full record of his life contained in this
<br/>valuable volume, must of course be gratefully received by all who
<br/>have any knowledge of his writings. The work by which he is best
<br/>known in this country, is his Introduction to the Study of Modern
<br/>History. His writings were very numerous, but those most widely known, are the Lectures on Modern History, which are incomplete--and a History of Rome in three volumes, ending at the second Punic
<br/>War.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The publishers have done the public a service in reprinting this
<br/>book; and we hope to see the practice followed by other publishers,
<br/>which they have here introduced, of giving the edition from which
<br/>the work is republished.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Oneota, or the Red Race of America—their History, Tradition, Customs,
<br/>Poetry, Picture-Writing, &amp;c., in Extracts from Notes, Journals, and other
<br/>unpublished writings, by Henry R. Schoolcraft. Nos. 1 to 4. Burgess,
<br/>Stringer &amp; Co. Price 25 cents.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The first time that we saw Mr. Schoolcraft personally, was at Mi-
<br/>chilimackinac, surrounded by a company of noble looking fellows, of
<br/>the race whose history is so fully elucidated in the work before us.
<br/>His name is so familiarly connected with Indian tradition and cus-
<br/>-toms, that any work on these subjects, bearing his name, must meet
<br/>with a favorable reception from his countrymen. Oneota is a work of
<br/>very miscellaneous character, but all its miscellanies tend to the
<br/>elucidation of one subject. It is well printed and properly illustrated,
<br/>not with unmeaning pictures of effeminate looking Indians, in fancy
<br/>costumes, but with actual transcripts of their picture-writing—which
<br/>prove one thing very clearly—that Art, in her first rugged attempts at
<br/>delineating nature, and in her last effeminate endeavor at the same
<br/>object, stands at about the same distance from the object aimed at.
<br/>There is abundant reading in these numbers tor the mere idler in lite-
<br/>-rature, as well as for the student in Ethnology and Archaeology.</p>
         <p>The Southern Quarterly Review. No. XII. Charleston, S. C.
</p>
         <p>This is a very respectable looking periodical, hardly if at all infe-
<br/>ferior to the North American, or any of the foreign Quarterlies, in its
<br/>externals. It must have been very quietly conducted, for we do not re-
<br/>-member ever having heard it spoken of, or of seeing it in any of our
<br/>bookstores or reading rooms. It professes to advocate Southern in-
<br/>-terests, but it is conducted by a New England man, Mr. Whitaker, the
<br/>son of a Unitarian clergyman, who preached, once, in New Bedford.
<br/>Any literary publication that narrows itself down to so small a com-
<br/>-pass as South Carolina prejudices must, of course, be exceedingly
<br/>narrow in its moral dimensions. But we do not find anything very ex-
<br/>-clusive in this number, excepting an article on Annexation—which,
<br/>being written by a professed admirer of Mr. Calhoun, is, of course,
<br/>strongly impregnated with the flavor of his prejudices. The longest
<br/>article in the Review is devoted to the writings of Cornelius Matthews.
<br/>While the reviewer complains in no moderate terms of the hardships
<br/>of American authors, arising from lack of sympathy among their own
<br/>countrymen, he does not, himself, appear to be aware that there are
<br/>any other American writers beside the subject of his paper and Judge
<br/>Longstreet. He hints at Halleck and Jack Downing, but makes no
<br/>mention of any other American author. While talking about home, his
<br/>eyes are stretched across the water. Probably he does not consider
<br/>the Northern States as a part of the Union. He denies the quality of
<br/>humor to any American author, and appears to be profoundly igno-
<br/>-rant of the existence of Washington Irving, Hawthorn, Joseph Neal,
<br/>Paulding, Holmes, Sands, and a score or two more. In speaking of Mr.
<br/>Matthews’ merits, he makes him run the gauntlet through a host of
<br/>tall men from the time of Homer down to Dickens; as a poet, he</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p62"/>
         </p>
         <p>measures him with the Greeks; as a dramatist, with Fletcher, Con-
<br/>greve, and Shakspeare; as a humorist, with Hogarth; as a novelist,
<br/>with Fielding, Smollet, Scott, and Dickens. This is a rather severe
<br/>trial, but the reviewer entertains a high opinion of the genius of Mr.
<br/>Matthews, notwithstanding the cruel test that he tries him by. The
<br/>article is written in a very grave and solemn tone, but it contains two
<br/>witticisms, though they are of a rather ponderous character; he calls
<br/>the English John Ox, and the Irish Sans Potato. Without quarrelling
<br/>with him for emasculating the national emblem of the English, we
<br/>must object to the new name for the Irish—it should be Sans-every-
<br/>thing-but-Potato, if sans anything.</p>
         <p>The Waif—A Collection of Poems.
Poems by James R. Lowell.
Voices of the Night, by Longfellow. Cambridge: Published by James
Owen. 1845.
</p>
         <p>To catch the eye is as desirable and almost as indispensable in
<br/>bookselling as in other branches of trade. Nor do we object to suc-
<br/>-cessful experiment of the kind where the fair promise thus volunteered
<br/>is kept “to the hope.” Such is the case with the three volumes men-
<br/>-tioned above. The are bound in illuminated paper covers, and have
<br/>altogether more tempting exteriors than any specimens of American
<br/>book-making we have seen. Something at once cheeerful and myste-
<br/>-rious, radiates from the bright arabesque designs that glow like the
<br/>missals of old. A more dainty and appropriate style for works of ele-
<br/>-gant literature can scarcely be imagined, and we hope Mr. Owen will
<br/>persevere in furnishing readers of taste with volumes equally delight-
<br/>-ful. One advantage of this kind of binding is, that it is easily replaced
<br/>by more substantial when defaced; an especial convenience to those
<br/>who adopt uniform covers in arranging their libraries. As regards the
<br/>contents of the volumes, it is almost superfluous to speak. “The
<br/>Waif” is a collection of fugitive pieces, most of which are familiar to
<br/>the lovers of poetry—such as the “Lament of the Irish Emigrant,”
<br/>Horace Smith’s “Ode to the Flowers,” and other gems by Shelley,
<br/>Hood, and some of the old poets. Longfellow, the compiler, has an-
<br/>-nexed a beautiful poem of his own. This author’s “Voices of the
<br/>Night” will be very acceptable to his admirers in its new and elegant
<br/>dress, and Mr. Lowell’s volume not less so to those who sympathize
<br/>with his muse.	_______</p>

</p>
         <p>The illustration given with these two numbers, is an exceedingly
<br/>neat border, with a Vignette to a Parent’s Register. The illustrations
<br/>of the past numbers have all been from celebrated pictures. If the re-
<br/>-mainder should contain as many illustrations from good pictures, the
<br/>work would be worth having for the illustrations alone.</p>

         <p>VARIETIES.
THE MEANNESSES OF ENGLISH LIFE.
</p>
         <p>English travellers choose to express a good deal of horror
<br/>for our crying sins, for which, perhaps, we have no right to
<br/>complain. Our stabbing of members of State Legislatures,
<br/>repudiating millions of debts, keeping three millions of fel-
<br/>-low beings in bondage, and other offences of like magnitude,
<br/>have all something grandiose and immense about them,</p>
         <p/>
         <p>which must give our enemies a magnificent idea of the na-
<br/>-tional character. Great crimes are never perpetrated by
<br/>paltry characters. Among all the affairs laid to our door by
<br/>our British friends, meanness has never been enumerated.
<br/>But if we are to believe one half of what the English tell of
<br/>themselves, they are the meanest people in the world in their
<br/>social relations. A year or two ago the Literary Gazette
<br/>contained a series of papers under the head of “London one
<br/>Lie,” in which the paltry practices of the Cockneys were set
<br/>forth, representing a littleness of character which could not
<br/>be paralleled in any part of our Union.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The practices of respectable tradesmen and royal servants,
<br/>as exposed in the following dialogue, would make our smallest
<br/>shopkeepers and lowest menials blush if charged with. Yet
<br/>they are freely acknowledged by London tradesmen of high
<br/>respectability, without causing any great astonishment.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Bless me, here is another illustration of my exposures! Candles;
<br/>and brought very properly to trial before that worthy and sagacious
<br/>police magistrate, Mr. Hard-Wick. I have thought of candles; but
<br/>this information before him beats even my information on the frauds.</p>
         <p>Pri. and Phi. What is it? what is it?
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. A gentleman’s under butler has been taken before his
<br/>worship, having been detected in selling boxes of candles, whole and
<br/>half-burnt, to a chandler in St. Martin’s Lane. Their first price was
<br/>2s. 2d. or 2s. 4d.; and the butler re-sold them at 9d. or 10d. per lb.</p>
         <p>Phi. Yes, yes, but they had been half-burnt?
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. Many no doubt had been lighted, which is in itself a com-
<br/>-mon deception, as you may notice in hundreds of London shop-win-
<br/>-dows; but they are lighted by the shop-keepers themselves.</p>
         <p>Pri. Surely they would lose by that!
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. Not a farthing in 20 lbs. The wick is merely blackened
<br/>and the other end is pared off into the melting-pots, and they are exhi-
<br/>bited as best wax candles from the royal palaces or some other almost
<br/>royal residence.</p>
         <p>Phi. I have seen the royal candle-ends with my own eyes delivered
at the shop doors, from boxes with royal arms.
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. And so have I; but that is all to aid imposition. The
<br/>candles so vamped are of inferior materials; the inner part being one
<br/>of several mixtures, which I shall hereafter explain to you, and only
<br/>the outer casing of wax. I have found them so little combined, that I
<br/>could push the interior small compound, 1-4 of an inch in diameter,
<br/>out of its real wax wrapper, and make the latter like the tube of a —</p>
         <p>Phi. Pea-shooter.
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. Exactly! And then the parings! Do you know there
<br/>are but three houses in the wax trade who supply royalty; and in
<br/>these economic days, they receive back the mass of the fragments
<br/>(not the far gone bits), and pay half price for it to re-melt; and as
<br/>for scraping the ends to fit them for chandeliers and candlesticks, the
<br/>lord steward would speedily dismiss the officer or menial who dared
<br/>to venture on such a perquisite. Whenever you see such, be aware
<br/>they are unacquainted with a palace.</p>
         <p>Pri. Did Mr. Hard-Wick find this out?
</p>
         <p>Aunt M. No, my dear; but when the master chandler came be
<br/>fore him respecting the charge against his servant for purchasing the
<br/>butler’s ware, he frankly told the magistrate about some of the prac-
<br/>tices of the trade, which he at last deemed worthy of public exposure.
<br/>He said he was sorry to say that many persons who called themselves
<br/>respectable oilmen and wax-chandlers encouraged servants to rob
<br/>their masters, and mentioned the names of several highly respectable
<br/>tradesmen who did so. As they, however, did, he was obliged to do
<br/>the same, and had been in the habit of doing so ever since he was an
<br/>apprentice. He could assure gentlemen that if they would take these
<br/>affairs into their own hands, they would save from 50 to 75 per cent
<br/>in oil and candles alone. He was now prepared to state a case in
<br/>which a butler had robbed his master to the amount of 75 per cent
<br/>upon the article of sperm oil alone. After some farther agreeable
<br/>chat, he repeated that if he did not buy from servants, like the rest,
<br/>he might shut up shop directly, as he should be ruined were he not to
<br/>comply with the custom of the trade.</p>
         <p>LETTER FROM AN ANXIOUS FATHER.
To the Editor of the Broadway Journal.
</p>
         <p>Six,—I am the father of two young men, still in their minority,
<br/>whom I have educated for the profession of a Merchant. They have
<br/>always paid implicit attention to my requests, and it has ever been
<br/>one of the chief sources of my happiness to look forward to the time
<br/>when they should be safely established in the business for which I
<br/>have trained them. But latterly their conduct has given me many
<br/>anxious moments. Instead of spending their evenings at home in
<br/>improving conversation or study, as I would have them do; they rarely
<br/>remain an hour in the house after dark. Their time is wholly employ-
<br/>-ed in waiting upon young ladies of their acquaintance to balls, parties,
<br/>and concerts. It is a source of pride to me, I must confess, to know
<br/>that they are sought after, and that the education which I have given
<br/>them, makes their company desirable, but I fear that their minds will
<br/>be too much engrossed with frivolous matters, and that all my hopes
<br/>of their respectability hereafter, will be disappointed. What makes the case worse, is the fact that my wife and sisters secretly encourage
<br/>them in setting my authority at defiance, by telling them that I was, at
<br/>their age, one of the wildest young men about town, and a very great</p>
         <p>
            <a href="#p63"/>
         </p>
         <p>hand with the ladies. This is excessively mortifying to me, because
<br/>I cannot deny it, for the date of my marriage, at a very early age, is
<br/>put upon the family record. But it appears to me that times have
<br/>changed, and that young men are not so prudent as they were before I
<br/>was married. I have written this note to you, hoping that you will
<br/>suggest some plan for inducing young gentlemen to remain contentedly
<br/>at home with their own family. I tell my sons that I would ask for
<br/>no greater happiness than to change places with them, and be allowed
<br/>the privilege of spending a quiet evening with my parents, who have
<br/>long been, as I trust, in Heaven. The only reply they make is, that
<br/>they have no doubt of having the same feelings when they reach my
<br/>age. But I do doubt it, for it is very evident that the young men of
<br/>the present day cannot compare with the youths of the last century.</p>
         <p>Your obedient servant.
George S. Prudence.
</p>
         <p>P. S. You will confer a favor on all parents, by showing up the evil
<br/>influences of the whole brood of writers of the Charles O’Malley school,
<br/>who, I fear, together with a very Harry Lorruqueer-ish young gentle-
<br/>-man, from Dublin, with whom my boys have formed an intimacy, are
<br/>doing much to give them an appetite for frolicking and high life.</p>
         <p>To the Editor of the Broadway Journal:
Dear Sir,
</p>
         <p>Generally speaking, “advice gratis” is anything but acceptable,
<br/>but the example of Buonaparte in this respect is not unworthy of imi-
<br/>-tation. You will recollect he ascertained the opinions of his friends,
<br/>and then followed his own inclination. As Sir Giles Overreach says,
<br/>“Learn any thing from any creature—e’en from the devil himself—
<br/>that can make thee great.” But I am forgetting the object of this let-
<br/>-ter—touching the “Broadway Journal.” As one of a considerable
<br/>circle of social friends, I am requested to express their admiration
<br/>and approval of your hebdomadal—of the high and manly tone of your
<br/>articles—of your enlarged and liberal views on various subjects—the
<br/>candor and elaborateness of your reviews, and in fact the general style
<br/>and character of the work. Now there is one feature of the publica-
<br/>-tion which they condemn, and that is the wood cuts. True, you have
<br/>had but one, and a very beautiful specimen of the art it was, but you
<br/>promise more. They say that they disfigure the work, and are un-
<br/>-worthy of the “Broadway Journal”—that the space they will occupy
<br/>might be more profitably filled with reading matter, and the expense
<br/>more wisely applied to something of more real value.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>I am further directed to say, that this advice is perfectly gratuitous,
<br/>and it is hoped you will receive it in that spirit, with which it is prof-
<br/>-fered. Trusting it may not prove intrusive, I am, in their behalf and
<br/>my own,	One of a number of Subscribers.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>We are infinitely obliged by the kind advice contained in
<br/>the above. We determined to give wood engravings in
<br/>our paper with the sole view of giving encouragement to this
<br/>art among us; but we necessarily incur a considerable ex-
<br/>-pense in doing so, and it would better suit our interests to
<br/>abandon the design. But we think it the only legitimate
<br/>method of illustrating printed matter. It partakes of the
<br/>quality of typography, and creates no incongruous feelings as
<br/>the smoothness and delicacy of steel and lithographic en-
<br/>-gravings must do. Besides, it admits of a breadth and bold-
<br/>-ness of expression which can be given by no other method of
<br/>pictorial illustration. Generally, we think that pictures
<br/>should be kept apart from printed matter. They interfere
<br/>with each other, and instead of helping to illustrate an idea,
<br/>their mixed methods of conveying a thought tend to obscure
<br/>it. In portraits, however, and architectural descriptions,
<br/>drawings are necessary to convey correct ideas. In works
<br/>of the imagination pictures always destroy the idea which
<br/>the poet creates. Whoever has looked through a Byron Gal-
<br/>-lery, a Waverley Gallery, or a Shakspeare Gallery, must have
<br/>felt this. It would be just as rational to give a pictorial il-
<br/>-lustration of Haydn’s Surprise, as of the Midsummer Night’s
<br/>Dream.</p>
         <p>Notice to Readers and Correspondents.—Many thanks to our
Hartford Correspondent for his valuable suggestions.
The communication of “E. G. S." will appear in our next number.
“G. H.” will find a communication at our publishing office.
The Tale by “P. S.” is declined.
“Matthew Truman" shall have a hearing next week.
We shall give another wood-cut illustration in our next number, of a
very peculiar character—representing a “Suspended Bishop."

translated from the French of M. Michelet, by G. H. Smith.

         <p>From the Courier and Enquirer, July 27, 1844.
<br/>Goldsmith’s Gems of Pennmanship.—The Chirographic art is
<br/>much more important to mankind than it is generally considered, and
<br/>Mr. Goldsmith may well claim to be considered at its head. The
<br/>volume before us exhibits more taste and ingenuity, and higher proofs
<br/>of manual dexterity than we have ever seen before.</p>
         <p>From the New York Express.
</p>
         <p>Goldsmith’s Gems of Penmanship.—We have seen the original, as
<br/>executed by his own hand, and a more beautiful, and indeed a more
<br/>wonderful display of the power of that little instrument which is said
<br/>to be “more potent than the sword,” we never witnessed before.</p>

Prospectus of the Broadway Journal,
To be Published every Saturday.
</p>
         <p>The Broadway Journal will differ from any of the weekly Peri-
<br/>-odicals now published in this city, as it will be made up entirely of
<br/>original matter, consisting of Essays, Criticisms on Art and Literature,
<br/>Domestic and Foreign Correspondence, and Literary and Scientific
<br/>Intelligence.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Illustrations will be given as often as good original Designs can
<br/>be procured, and drawings and plans of all new public buildings that
<br/>have either elegance or novelty to recommend them to notice. Par-
<br/>-ticular attention will be given to this department, and no pains spared
<br/>to make it worthy of patronage.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>Efficient aid has already been secured in the services of some of the
<br/>best writers in the country; but it is hoped that a free channel be-
<br/>-ing opened through which true-hearted men may “let loose their
<br/>thoughts,” will be the means of drawing out some of the slumbering
<br/>talent amongst us which has not yet been seen afloat on the surface of
<br/>our periodical literature.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>The Broadway Journal will espouse the cause of no political par-
<br/>-ty, but will hold itself free to condemn or approve any men or meas-
<br/>-ures, that a patriotic regard for the welfare of the country may dictate.
<br/>It will be printed on fine paper with clear type, in the Octavo form of
<br/>16 pages, double columns.</p>
         <p>Terms $3,00 per annum—Single numbers 6 1-4 cts.
A liberal discount to Periodical Agents.
All Communications for the Editor must be addressed to the Editor
of the Broadway Journal, and all letters on business to
