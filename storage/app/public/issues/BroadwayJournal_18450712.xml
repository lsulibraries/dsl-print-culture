         <p>To the Public.—The suspension of “ The Broadway
<br/>Journal" for one week, has been occasioned by the necessity
<br/>for some arrangements in which the public have no interest,
<br/>but which, beyond doubt, will give increased value and
<br/>efficiency to the paper.</p>
          <p>In commencing the Second Volume, the undersigned begs
<br/>leave to return his sincere thanks to the numerous friends
<br/>who have lent him their aid in the very difficult task of
<br/>establishing a literary and critical weekly. The success of
<br/>the work, in the brief period of its existence, has been, he
<br/>truly believes, beyond precedent—and from a brilliant Past,
<br/>he looks confidently to a triumphant Future.</p>
          <p>The editorial conduct of “ The Broadway Journal” is un-
<br/>der the sole charge of Edgar A. Poe—Mr. H. C. Watson,
<br/>as heretofore, controlling the Musical Department.</p>

         <br/>
         <p>I presume every body has heard of me. My name is the
<br/>Signora Psyche Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. No
<br/>body but my enemies ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been
<br/>assured that Suky is but a vulgar corruption of Psyche, which
<br/>is good Greek, and means “the soul" (that’s me, I'm all
<br/>soul) and sometimes “ a butterfly,” which latter meaning
<br/>undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new crimson
<br/>satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and the
<br/>trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of
<br/>orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs—any person who
<br/>should look at me would be instantly aware that my name
<br/>was n’t Snobbs. Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that re-
<br/>port through sheer envy. Tabitha Turnip indeed! Oh
<br/>the little wretch ! But what can we expect from a tur-
<br/>nip ? Wonder if she remembers ihe old adage about "blood
<br/>out of a turnip, &amp;c.” [Mem : put her in mind of it the first
<br/>opportunity.] [Mem again—pull her nose.] Where was I ?
<br/>Ah ! I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption
<br/>of Zenobia, and that Zenobia was a queen—(So am I. Dr.
<br/>Moneypenny, always calls me the Queen of Hearts)-and that
<br/>Zenobia, as well as Psyche, is good Greek, and that my fa-
<br/>ther was “a Greek,” and that consequently I have a right
<br/>to our patronymic, which is Zenobia, and not by any means
<br/>Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me Suky Snobbs-
<br/>I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.</p>
         <p>As I said before, every body has heard of me. I am that
<br/>very Signora Psyche Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corres-
<br/>ponding secretary to the “ Philadelphia. Regular, Exchange,
<br/>Tea, Total, Young, Belles, Lettns. Universal, Experimen-
<br/>tal, Bibliographical, Association, To, Civilize, Humanity.”
    Dr. Moneypenny made the title for us, and says he chose it
<br/>because it sounded big like an empty rum-puncheon. (A
<br/>vulgar man that sometimes—but he’s deep.) We all sign
<br/>the initials of the society after our names, in the fashion of
<br/>the R.S.A., Royal Society of Arts—the S.D.U.K., Society for
<br/>the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &amp;c. &amp;c. Dr. Moneypen-
<br/>ny says that S stands for stale, and that D.U.K. spells duck,
<br/>(but it don’t,) and that S.D.U.K. stands for Stale Duck, and
<br/>not tor Lord Brougham’s society—but then Dr. Moneypenny
<br/>is such a queer man that I am never sure when he is telling
<br/>me the truth. At any rate we always add to our names the
<br/>initials P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.—that is to say,
<br/>Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total, Young, Belles,
<br/>Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical, Associa-
<br/>tion, To, Civilize, Humanity—one letter for each word,
<br/>which is a decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr.
<br/>Moneypenny will have it that our initials give our true char-
<br/>acter—but for my life I can’t see what he means.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the
<br/>strenuous exertions of the association to get itself into notice,
<br/>it met with no very great success until I joined it. The
<br/>truth is, members indulged in too flippant a tone of discus-
<br/>sion. The papers read every Saturday evening were char-
<br/>acterized less by depth than buffoonery. They were all
<br/>whipped syllabub. There was no investigation of first cau-
<br/>ses, first principles. There was no investigation of anything
<br/>at all. There was no attention paid to that great point the
<br/>“ fitness of things.” In short there was no fine writing like
<br/>this. It was all low—very ! No profundity, no reading, no
<br/>metaphysics—nothing which the learned call spirituality,
<br/>and which the unlearned choose to stigmatise as cant. [Dr.
<br/>M. says I ought to spell “cant” with a capital K—but I
<br/>know better.]</p>
            <p>When I joined the society it was my endeavour to intro-
<br/>duce a better style of thinking and writing, and all the world
<br/>knows how well I have succeeded. We get up as good pa-
<br/>pers now in the P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H. as any
<br/>to he found even in Blackwood. I say, Blackwood, because
<br/>I have been assured that the finest writing, upon every sub-
<br/>ject, is to be discovered in the pages of that justly celebrated
<br/>Magazine. We now take it for our model upon all themes,
<br/>and are getting into rapid notice accordingly. And, after
<br/>all, it’s not so very difficult a matter to compose an article
<br/>of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only goes properly
<br/>about it. Of course I do n’t speak of the political articles.
<br/>Every body knows how they are managed, since Dr. Money
<br/>penny explained it. Mr. Blackwood has a pair of tailor’s-
<br/>shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for orders.
<br/>One hands him the “ Times,” another the “ Examiner,” and
<br/>a third a “Gulley’s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.’
<br/>Mr. B. merely cuts out and intersperses. It is soon done—
<br/>nothing but Examiner, Slang-Whang, and Times — then
<br/>Times, Slang-Whang, and Examiner—and then Times, Ex-
<br/>aminer, and Slang-Whang.</p>
            <p>But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscella-
<a href="#p2"/> 
neous articles ; and the best of these come under the head of
<br/>what Dr. Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that
<br/>may mean) and what every body else calls the intensities.
<br/>This is a species of writing which I have long known how
<br/>to appreciate, although it is only since my late visit to Mr.
<br/>Blackwood (deputed by the society) that I have been made
<br/>aware of the exact method of composition. This method is
<br/>very simple, but not so much so as the politics. Upon my call-
<br/>ing at Mr. B.’s, and making known to him the wishes of the
<br/>society, he received me with great civility, took me into his
<br/>study, and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process.</p>
            <p>“ My dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my
<br/>majestic appearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the
<br/>green agraffas, and orange-coloured auriculas, “ My dear
<br/>madam,” said he, “ sit down. The matter stands thus. In
<br/>the first place, your writer of intensities must have very black
<br/>ink, and a very big pen, with a very blunt nib. And, mark
<br/>me, Miss Psyche Zenobia!” he continued, after a pause,
<br/>with the most impressive energy and solemnity of manner,
<br/>“mark me!—that pen—must—never be mended! Herein,
<br/>madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I assume it
<br/>upon myself to say, that no individual, of however great
<br/>genius, ever wrote with a good pen,—understand me,—a
<br/>good article. You may take it for granted, that when manu-
<br/>script can be read it is never worth reading. This is a lead-
<br/>ing principle in our faith, to which if you cannot readily as-
<br/>sent, our conference is at an end.”</p>
            <p>He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an
<br/>end to the conference, I assented to a proposition so very ob-
<br/>vious, and one, too, of whose truth I had all along been suffi-
<br/>ciently aware. He seemed pleased, and went on with his
<br/>instructions.</p>
            <p>“ It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to
<br/>refer you to any article, or set of articles, in the way of
<br/>model or study ; yet perhaps I may as well call your atten-
<br/>tion to a few cases. Let me see. There was ‘ The Dead
<br/>Alive,' a capital thing!—the record of a gentleman's sensa-
<br/>when entombed before the breath was out of his body—ful]
<br/>tions, of taste, terror, sentiment, metaphysics, and erudition.
<br/>You would have sworn that the writer had been born and
<br/>brought up in a coffin. Then we had the ‘ Confessions of
<br/>an Opium-eater’—fine, very fine !—glorious imagination—
<br/>deep philosophy—acute speculation—plenty of fire and fury,
<br/>and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was
<br/>a nice bit of flummery, and went down the throats of the
<br/>people delightfully. They would have it that Coleridge
<br/>wrote the paper—but not so. It was composed by my pet
<br/>baboon. Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands and water, ' hot.
<br/>without sugar.’” [This I could scarcely have believed had
<br/>it been any body but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of it.]
<br/>“ Then there was ' The Involuntary Experimentalist,' all
<br/>about a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out
<br/>alive and well, although certainly done to a turn. And
<br/>then there was ' The Diary of a Late Physician,' where
<br/>the merit lay in good rant, and indifferent Greek—both of
<br/>them taking things, with the public. And then there was
<br/>' The Man in the Del!,' a paper by-the bye, Miss Zenobia,
<br/>which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention. It
<br/>is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the
<br/>clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a
<br/>funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pull-
<br/>ing out his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sen-
<br/>sations are the great things after all. Should you ever be
<br/>drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your sensa-
<br/>tions—they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet. If you
<br/>wish to write forcibly, Miss Zenobia, pay minute attention to 
              the sensations.”</p>
         <p>“ That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,” said I.
</p>
         <p>“Good!” he replied. “I see you are a pupil after my
<br/>own heart. But I must put you au fait to the details neces-
<br/>sary in composing what may be denominated a genuine
<br/>Blackwood article of the sensation stamp—the kind which
<br/> you will understand me to say I consider the best for all pur-
<br/>poses.</p>
            <p>“ The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a
<br/>jscrape as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,
<br/>—that was a good hit. But if you have no oven, or bigbell,
<br/>iat hand, and if you cannot conveniently tumble out of a bal-
<br/>loon, or be swallowed up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast
<br/> in a chimney, you will have to be contented with simply im-
<br/>agining some similar misadventure. I should prefer, how-
<br/>ever, that you have the actual fact to bear you out. Nothing
<br/> so well assists the fancy, as an experimental knowledge of the
<br/> matter in hand. ‘Truth is strange,’ you know, ‘ stranger
<br/>than fiction’—besides being more to the purpose.”</p>
            <p>Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and
              would go and hang myself forthwith.</p>
         <p>“Good !” he replied, “do so;—although hanging is some-
<br/>what hacknied. Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose
<br/>of Brandreth’s pills, and then give us your sensations. How-
<br/>ever, my instructions will apply equally well to any variety
<br/>of misadventure, and in your way home you may easily gel
<br/>knocked in the head, or run over by an omnibus, or bitten by
<br/>a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter. But, to proceed.</p>
            <p>“ Having determined upon your subject, you must next
<br/>consider the tone, or manner, of your narration. There is
<br/>the lone didactic, the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural—all
<br/>common-place enough. But then there is the lone laconic,
<br/>or curt, which has lately come much into use. It consists in
<br/>short sentences. Somehow thus. Can’t be too brief. Can’t
<br/>be too snappish. Always a full stop. And never a para-
<br/> graph.</p>
            <p>“Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjec-
<br/>tional. Some of our best novelists patronize this tone. The
<br/>jwords must be all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make
<br/>a noise very similar, which answers remarkably well instead
<br/> of meaning. This is the best of all possible styles where
<br/>the writer is in too great a hurry to think.</p>
            <p>“ The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know
<br/>any big words this is your chance for them. Talk of the
<br/>Ionic and Eleatic schools—of Archytas, Gorgias and Alemoe-
<br/>on. Say something about objectivity and subjectivity. Be
<br/>sure and abuse a man called Locke. Turn up your nose at
<br/> things in general, and when you let slip anything a little too
<br/>absurd, you need not be at the trouble of scratching it out,
<br/>but just add a foot-note, and say that you are indebted for the
<br/>above profound observation to the ' Kritik der reinem Ver-
<br/>nunft,' or to the ‘ Metaphysische Anfangsgrunde der Natur-
<br/>wissenschaft.' This will look erudite and—and—and frank.</p>
            <p>“ There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I
<br/>shall mention only two more—the tone transcendental and the
<br/>tone heterogeneous. In the former the merit consists in
<br/>seeing into (he nature of affairs a very great deal farther than
<br/>any body else. This second sight is very efficient when pro-
<br/>perly managed. A little reading of the ‘ Dial’ will carry you
<br/>a great way. Eschew, in this case, big words; get them as
<br/>small as possible, and write them upside down. Look over
<br/>Channing’s poems and quote what he says about a ‘ fat little
<br/>man with a delusive show of Can.’ Put in something about
<br/>the Supernal Oneness. Don’t say a syllable about the In-
<br/>fernal Twoness. Above all, study inuendo. Hint every
<br/>thing—assert nothing. If you feel inclined to say ‘ bread <a href="#p3"/>
and butter’ do not by any means say it outright. You may
<br/>say anything and every thing approaching to ‘bread and
<br/>butter.' You may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may
<br/>even go so far as to insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread
<br/>and butter be your real meaning, be cautious, my dear Miss
<br/>Psyche, net on any account to say ' bread and butter!’ ”</p>
            <p>I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I
lived. He kissed me and continued:</p>
            <p>“As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious
<br/>mixture, in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the
<br/>World, and is consequently made up of everything deep,
<br/>great, odd, piquant, pertinent, and pretty.</p>
            <p>“ Let us suppose now you have determined upon your in-
<br/>cidents and tone. The most important portion, — in fact
<br/>the soul of the whole business, is yet to be attended to—I
<br/>allude to the filling up. It is not to be supposed that a lady
<br/>or gentleman either has been leading the life of a bookworm.
<br/>And yet above all things it is necessary that your article have
<br/>an air of erudition, or at least afford evidence of extensive
<br/>general reading. Now I’ll put you in the way of accom-
<br/>plishing this point. See here!’’ (pulling down some three
<br/>or four ordinary looking volumes, and opening them at ran-
<br/>dom.) “ By casting your eye down almost any page of any
<br/>book in the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host
<br/>of little scraps of either learning or bel-esprit-ism, which are
<br/>the very thing for the spicing of a Blackwood article. You
<br/>might as well note down a few while I read them to you. I
<br/>shall make two divisions: first, Piquant Facts for the Manu-
<br/>facture of Similes; and second, Piquant Expressions to be
<br/>introduced as occasion may require. Write now!—" and I
<br/>wrote as he dictated.</p>
            <p>“Piquant Facts for Similes. ‘ There were originally
<br/>but three Muses—Melete, Mneme, and Aoede—meditation,
<br/>memory, and singing.’ You may make a great deal of that
<br/>little fact if properly worked. You see it is not generally
<br/>known, and looks recherche. You must be careful and give
<br/>the thing with a downright improvise air.</p>
            <p>“ Again. ‘ The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea, and
<br/>emerged without injury to the purity of its waters.’ Rather
<br/>stale that, to be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up,
<br/>will look quite as fresh as ever.</p>
            <p>“ Here is something better. ' The Persian Iris appears to
<br/>some persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume,
<br/>while to others it is perfectly scentless.’ Fine that, and very
<br/>delicate! Turn it about a little, and it will do wonders.
<br/>We’ll have something else in the botanical line. There’s
<br/>nothing goes down so well, especially with the help of a little
<br/>Latin. Write!</p>
            <p>"'The Epidendrum Flos Aeris, of Java, bears a very
<br/>beautiful flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots.
<br/>The natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy
<br/>its fragrance for years.’ That’s capital! That will do for
<br/>the similes. Now for the Piquant Expressions.</p>
            <p>Piquant Expressions. ‘ The venerable Chinese novel Ju-
<br/>Kiao-Li.’ Good ! By introducing these few words with
<br/>dexterity you will evince your intimate acquaintance with
<br/>the language and literature of the Chinese. With the aid
<br/>of this you may possibly get along without either Arabic, or
<br/>Sanscrit, or Chickasaw. There is no passing muster, how-
<br/>ever, without Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, and Greek.
<br/>I must look you out a little specimen of each. Any scrap
<br/>will answer, because you must depend upon your own inge-
<br/>nuity to make it fit into your article. Now write!</p>
            <p>“ ' Aussi tendre que Zaire'—as tender as Zaire—French.
Alludes to the frequent repetition of the phrase, la tendre
Zaire, in the French tragedy of that name. Properly intro-
<br/>duced, will show not only your knowledge of the language,
<br/>but your general reading and wit. You can say, for instance,
<br/>that the chicken you were eating (write an article about be-
<br/>ing choked to death by a chicken-bone) was not altogether
<br/>aussi tendre que Zaire. Write!</p>
‘ Van muerle tan escondida,
Que no te sienta renir,
Porque el plazer del morir
No me torne a dar la vida.'
<p>That’s Spanish—from Miguel de Cervantes. ‘ Come quickly
<br/>O death! but be sure and don’t let me see you coming, lest
<br/>the pleasure I shall feel at your appearance should unfor-
<br/>tunately bring me back again to life.’ This you may slip in
<br/>quite a propos when you are struggling in the last agonies
<br/>with the chicken-bone. Write!</p>
            ‘ Il pover ’huomo che non se’n era accorto,
Andava combattendo, e era morto.’
<p>That’s Italian, you perceive,—from Ariosto. It means that
<br/>a great hero, in the heat of combat, not perceivin that he
<br/>had been fairly killed, continued to fight valiantly, dead as
<br/>he was. The application of this to your own case is obvious
<br/>—for I trust, Miss Psyche, that you will not neglect to kick
<br/>for at least an hour and a half after you have been choked to
<br/>death by that chicken-bone. Please to write!</p>
            ‘ Und sterb’ich doch, no sterb’ich denn
Durch sie—durch sie."
<p>That’s German—from Schiller. ‘And if I die, at least I die
<br/>—for thee—for thee!’ Here it is clear that you are apostro-
<br/>phising the cause of your disaster, the chicken. Indeed what
<br/>gentleman (or lady either) of sense, would'nt die, I should
<br/>like to know, for a well fattened capon of the right Molucca
<br/>breed, stuffed with capers and mushrooms, and served up in
<br/>a salad-bowl, with orange-jellies en mosuiques. Write!
<br/>(You can get them that way at Tortoni’s,)—Write, if you
<br/>please'.</p>
            <p>“ Here is a nice little Latin phrase, and rare too, (one can’t
<br/>be too reckerche or brief in one’s Latin, it’s getting so com-
<br/>mon,)—ignoratio elenchi. He has committed an ignoratio
<br/>elenchi—that is to say, he has understood the words of your
<br/>proposition, but not the ideas. The man was a fool, you
<br/>see. Some poor fellow whom you addressed while choking
<br/>with that chicken-bone, and who therefore did’nt precisely
<br/>understand what you were talking about. Throw the igno-
<br/>ratio elenchi in his teeth, and, at once, you have him annihi-
<br/>lated. If he dare to reply, you can tell him from Lucan
<br/>(here it is) that speeches are mere anemonae verborum, ane-
<br/>mone words. The anemone, with great brilliancy, has no
<br/>smell. Or, if he begin to bluster, you may be down upon
<br/>him with insomnia Jovis, reveries of Jupiter—a phrase which
<br/>Silius Italicus (see here!) applies to thoughts pompous and
<br/>inflated. This will be sure and cut him to the heart. He
<br/>can do nothing but roll over and die. Will you be kind
<br/>enough to write?</p>
            <p>“In Greek we must have something pretty—from Demos-
<br/>thenes, for example. Ανερ ο φεογων χαι παλιν μαχεσεται.
<br/>[Aner o pheogon kai palin makesetai.] There is a tolerably
<br/>good translation of it in Hudibras—</p>For he that flies may fight again,
Which he can never do that’s slain.
<p>In a Blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your
<br/>Greek. The very letters have an air of profundity about
<br/>them. Only observe, madam, the astute look of that Epsi-
<br/>ion! That Phi ought certainly to be a bishop! Was ever
<br/>there a smarter fellow than that Omicron ? Just twig that
<br/>Tau! In short, there is nothing like Greek for a genuine
<a href="#p4"/>
sensation-paper. In the present case your application is the
<br/>most obvious thing in the world. Rap out the sentence,
<br/>with a huge oath, and by way of ultimatum, at the good-for-
<br/>nothing dunder-headed villain who couldn’t understand your
<br/>plain English in relation to the chicken-bone. He’ll take
<br/>the hint and be off, you may depend upon it.”</p>
            <p>These were all the instructions Mr. B. could afford me up-
<br/>on the topic in question, but I felt they would be entirely
<br/>sufficient. I was, at length, able to write a genuine Black-
<br/>wood article, and determined to do it forthwith. In taking
<br/>leave of me, Mr. B. made a proposition for the purchase of
<br/>the paper when written; but as he could offer me only fifty
<br/>guineas a sheet, I thought it better to let our society have
<br/>it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a sum. Notwithstanding
<br/>this niggardly spirit, however, the gentleman showed his
<br/>consideration for me in all other respects, and indeed treated
<br/>me with the greatest civility. His parting words made a
<br/>deep impression upon my heart, and I hope I shall always
<br/>remember them with gratitude.</p>
            <p>" My dear Miss Zenobia,” he said, while the tears stood
<br/>in his eyes, “ is there anything else I can do to promote the
<br/>success of your laudable undertaking? Let me reflect! It
<br/>is just possible that you may not be able, so soon as conve-
<br/>nient, to — to — get yourself drowned, or — choked with
<br/>a chicken-bone, or — or hung, — or —bitten by a — but
<br/>stay ! Now I think me of it, there are a couple of very ex-
<br/>cellent bull dogs in the yard — fine fellows, I assure you —
<br/>savage, and all that — indeed just the thing for your
<br/>money — they’ll have you eaten up, auriculas and all, in
<br/>less than five minutes (here’s my watch !) — and then only
<br/>think of the sensations! Here! I say — Tom! — Peter!
<br/>— Dick, you villain ! — let out those” — but as I was really
<br/>in a great hurry, and had not another moment to spare, I
<br/>was reluctantly forced to expedite my departure, and accord-
<br/>ingly took leave at once— somewhat more abruptly, I ad-
<br/>mit, than strict courtesy would have, otherwise, allowed.</p>
            <p>It was my primary object, upon quitting Mr. Blackwood,
<br/>to get into some immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice,
<br/>and with this view I spent the greater part of the day in wan-
<br/>dering about Edinburgh, seeking lor desperate adventures—
<br/>adventures adequate to the intensity of my feelings, and
<br/>adapted to the vast character of the article I intended to
<br/>write. In this excursion I was attended by my negro-servant
<br/>Pompey, and my little lap-dog Diana, whom I had brought
<br/>with me from Philadelphia. It was not, however, until late
<br/>in the afternoon that l fully succeeded in my arduous under-
<br/>taking. An important event then happened, of which the
<br/>following Blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is
<br/>the substance and result.</p>
            A predicament.
<div class="ab">What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—COMUS.</div>
         <p>It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in
<br/>the goodly city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the
<br/>streets were terrible. Men were talking. Women were
<br/>screaming. Children were choking. Pigs were whistling.
<br/>Carts they rattled. Bulls they bellowed. Cows they low-
<br/>ed. Horses they neighed. Cals they caterwauled. Dogs
<br/>they danced. Danced! Could it then be possible ? Danc-
<br/>ed ! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over! Thus it
<br/>is ever. What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and
<br/>anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative
<br/>contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlast-
<br/>ing, and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say, the—
<br/>continued—yes, the continued and continuous, bitter, har-
  assing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the expression,
<br/>the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and
<br/>heavenly, and exalting, and ele ated, and purifying effect of
<br/>what may be rightly termed he most enviable, the most
<br/>truly enviable—nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most
<br/>deliciously ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I
<br/>may use so bold an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle
<br/>reader!) in the word—but I am led away by my feelings. In
<br/>such a mind, I repeat, what a host of recollections are stirred
<br/>up by a trifle ! The dogs danced ! I—I could not! They
<br/>frisked—I wept. They capered—I sobbed aloud. Touch-
<br/>ing circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the recol-
<br/>lection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in rela-
<br/>tion to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the com-
<br/>mencement of the third volume of that admirable and vene-
<br/>rable Chinese novel, the Jo-Go-Slow.</p>
            <p>In my solitary walk through the city I had two humble
<br/>but faithful companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of
<br/>creatures ! She had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and
<br/>a blue ribband tied fashionably around her neck. Diana was
<br/>not more than five inches in height, but her head was some-
<br/>what bigger than her body, and her tail, being cut off ex-
<br/>ceedingly close, gave an air of injured innocence to the inte-
<br/>resting animal which rendered her a favorite with all.</p>
            <p>And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey ! how shall I
<br/>ever forget thee? I had taken Pompey’s arm. He was three
<br/>feet in height (I like to be particular) and about seventy, or
<br/>perhaps eighty, years of age. He had bow-legs and was
<br/>corpulent. His mouth should not be called small, nor his
<br/>ears short. His teeth, however, were like pearl, and his
<br/>large full eyes were deliciously white. Nature had endowed
<br/>him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual with
<br/>that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet.
<br/>He was clad with a striking simplicity. His sole garments
<br/> were a stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new drab
<br/>overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall,
<br/>stately, and illustrious Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good
<br/>overcoat. It was well cut. It was well made. The coat
<br/>was nearly new. Pompey held it up out of the dirt with
<br/>both hands.</p>
            <p>There were three persons in our party, and two of them
<br/>have already been the subject of remark. There was a
<br/>third—that third person was myself. I am the Signora
<br/>Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky Snobbs. My appearance
<br/>is commanding. On the memorable occasion of which I
<br/>speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a sky-
<br/>blue Arabian mantelet. And the dress had trimmings of
<br/>green agraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the orange col-
<br/>ored auricula. I thus formed the third of the party. There
<br/>was the poodle. There was Pompey. There was myself.
<br/>We were three. Thus it is said there were originally but
<br/>three Furies—Melty, Nimmy and Hetty—Meditation, Mem-
<br/>ory, and Fiddling.</p>
            <p>Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended
<br/>at a respectful distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of
<br/>the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted
<br/>Edina. On a sudden, there presented itself to view a church
<br/>—a Gothic cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a tall
<br/>steeple, which towered into the sky. What madness now
<br/>possessed me ? Why did I rush upon my fate ? I was seiz-
<br/>ed with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinna-
<br/>cle, and thence survey the immense extent of the city. The
<br/>door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny pre-
<br/>vailed. I entered the ominous archway. Where then was
<br/>my guardian angel ?— if indeed such angels there be. If!
<br/>Distressing monosyllable! what a world of mystery, and
              <a href="#p5"/> 
meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved in thy
<br/>two letters! I entered the ominous archway! I entered;
<br/>and, without injury to my orange-colored auriculas, I passed
<br/>beneath the portal, and emerged within the vestibule!
<br/>Thus it is said the immense river Alfred passed, unscathed,
<br/>and unwetted, beneath the sea.</p>
            <p>I thought the staircases would never have an end.
<br/>Round! Yes, they went round and up, and round and up
<br/>and round and up, until I could not help surmising, with the
<br/>sagacious Pompey, upon whose supporting arm I leaned in
<br/>all the confidence of early affection—I could not help sur-
<br/>mising that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had
<br/>been accidentally, or perhaps designedly, removed. I paused
<br/>for breath; and, in the meantime, an incident occurred of
<br/>too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a metaphysi-
<br/>cal point of view, to be passed over without notice. It ap-
<br/>peared to me—indeed I was quite confident of the fact—I
<br/>could not be mistaken—no! I had, for some moments, care-
<br/>fully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana—I say
<br/>that I could not be mistaken—Diana smell a rat! At once
<br/>I called Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he
<br/>agreed with me. There was then no longer any reasonable
<br/>room for doubt. The rat had been smelled—and by Diana.
<br/>Heavens! shall I ever forget the intense excitement of that
<br/>moment? Alas! what is the boasted intellect of man?
<br/>The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was somewhere.
<br/>Diana smelled the rat. I—I could not! Thus it is said the
<br/>Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very power-
<br/>ful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.</p>
            <p>The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now
<br/>only three or four more upward steps intervening between us
<br/>and the summit. We still ascended, and now only one step
<br/>remained. One step! One little, little step! Upon one
<br/>such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast
<br/>a sum of human happiness or misery often depends! I
<br/>thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of the mysterious
<br/>and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. I thought of
<br/>Pompey !—alas, I thought of love ! I thought of the many
<br/>false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again.
<br/>I resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned
<br/>the arm of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted
<br/>the one remaining step, and gained the chamber of the bel-
<br/>fry. I was followed immediately afterwards by my poodle.
<br/>Pompey alone remained behind. I stood at the head of the
<br/>staircase, and encouraged him to ascend. He stretched
<br/>forth to me his hand, and unfortunately in so doing was forc
<br/>ed to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat. Will the
<br/>gods never cease their persecution ? The overcoat it dropped,
<br/>and, with one of his feet, Pompey stepped upon the long and
<br/>trailing skirt of the overcoat. He stumbled and fell—this
<br/>consequence was inevitable. He fell forwards, and, with
<br/>his accursed head, striking me full in the—in the breast,
<br/>precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon the
<br/>hard, filthy and detestable floor of the belfry. But my re-
<br/>venge was sure, sudden and complete. Seizing him furious-
<br/>ly by the wool with both hands, I lore out a vast quantity of
<br/>the black, and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from
<br/>me with every manifestation of disdain. It fell among the
<br/>ropes of the belfry and remained. Pompey arose, and said
<br/>no word. But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes
<br/>and—sighed. Ye gods—that sigh ! It sunk into my heart.
<br/>And the hair—the wool! Could I have reached that wool
<br/>I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of regret.
<br/>But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled
<br/>among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it still alive. I fan-
<br/>cied that it stood on end with indignation._Thus the happ
              dandy Flos Aeris of Java, bears, it is said, a beautiful flow-
<br/>er, which will live when pulled up by the roots. The na-
<br/>tives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fra-
<br/>grance for years.</p>
            <p>Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the
<br/>room for an aperture through which to survey the city of
<br/>Edina. Windows there were none. The sole light admit,
<br/>ted into the gloom chamber proceeded from a square open-
<br/>ing, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet
<br/>from the floor. Yet what will the energy of true genius
<br/>not effect? I resolved to clamber up to this hole. A vast
<br/>quantity of wheels, pinions, and other cabalistic-looking ma-
<br/>chinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the
<br/>hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery. Between
<br/>the wheels and the wall where the hole lay, there was bare-
<br/>ly room for my body—yet I was desperate, and determined
<br/>to persevere. I called Pompey to my side.</p>
            <p>“ You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look
<br/>through it. You will stand here just beneath the hole—so.
<br/>Now, hold out one of your hands, Pompey, and let me step
<br/>upon it—thus. Now, the other hand, Pompey, and with its
<br/>aid I will get upon your shoulders.”</p>
            <p>He did everything I wished, and I found, upon getting up,
<br/>that I could easily pass my head and neck through the aper-
<br/>ture. The prospect was sublime. Nothing could be more
<br/>magnificent. I merely paused a moment to bid Diana be-
<br/>have herself, and assure Pompey that I would be consider-
<br/>ate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders. I
<br/>told him I would be tender of his feelings—ossi tender que
<br/>beefsteak. Having done this justice to my faithful friend, I
<br/>gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoy-
<br/>ment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out be-
<br/>fore my eyes.</p>
            <p>Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I
<br/>will not describe the city of Edinburgh. Every one has
<br/>been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina. I will confine my-
<br/>self to the momentous details of my own lamentable adven-
<br/>ture. Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in re-
<br/>gard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the
<br/>city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and
<br/>the delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that the
<br/>aperture through which I had thrust my head was an open-
<br/>ing in the dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have ap-
<br/>peared, from the street, as a large keyhole, such as we see
<br/>iu the face of french watches. No doubt the true object was
<br/>to admit the arm of an attendant, to adjust, when necessary,
<br/>the hands of the clock from within. I observed also, with
<br/>surprise, the immense size of these hands, the longest of
<br/>which could not have been less than ten feet in length, and,
<br/>where broadest, eight or nine inches in breadth. They were
<br/>of solid steel apparently, and their edges appeared to be
<br/>sharp. Having noticed these particulars, and some others,
<br/>I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below,
<br/>and soon became absorbed in contemplation.</p>
            <p>From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice
<br/>of Pompey, who declared he could stand it no longer, and re-
<br/>quested that I would be so kind as to come down. This was
<br/>unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length.
<br/>He replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my
<br/> ideas upon the subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told
<br/>him in plain words that he was a fool, that he had commit-
<br/>ted an ignoramus e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere
<br/>insommary Bovis, and his words little belter than an enemy
<br/>werrybor'em. With this he appeared satisfied, and I resum-
<br/>ed my contemplations.</p>
         <p>It might have been half an hour after this altercation
<a href="#p6"/>
when, as I was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery be-
<br/>neath me, I was startled by something very cold which
<br/>pressed with a gentle pressure upon the back of my neck.
<br/>It is needless to say that I felt inexpressibly alarmed. I
<br/>knew that Pompey was beneath my feet, and that Diana
<br/>was sitting, according to my explicit directions, upon her
<br/>hind legs in the farthest corner of the room. What could it
<br/>be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning my head
<br/>gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror, that
<br/>the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock,
<br/>had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended, upon
<br/>my neck. There was, I knew, not a second to be lost. I
<br/>pulled back at once—but it was too late. There was no
<br/>chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terri-
<br/>ble trap in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew
<br/>narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be
<br/>conceived. The agony of that moment is not to be imagin-
<br/>ed. I threw up my hands and endeavoured, with all my
<br/>strength, to force upwards the ponderous iron bar. I might
<br/>as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself. Down, down,
<br/>down it came, closer, and yet closer. I screamed to Pompey
<br/>for aid: but he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him
<br/>“an ignorant old squint eye.” I yelled to Diana ; but she
<br/>only said “ bow-wow-wow,” and that “ I had told her on no
<br/>account to stir from the corner.” Thus I had no relief to ex-
<br/>pect from my associates.</p>
            <p>Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I
<br/>now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase)
<br/>had not stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career, 
<br/>Down and still down, it came. It had already buried its
<br/>sharp edge a full inch in my flesh, and my sensations grew ;
<br/>indistinct and confused. At one time I fancied myself in
<br/>Philadelphia with the stately Dr. Moneypenny, at another in
<br/>the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood receiving his invaluable!
<br/>instructions. And then again the sweet recollection of better 
<br/>and earlier times came over me, and I thought of that happy 
<br/>period when the world was not all a desert, and Pompey not
<br/>altogether cruel.</p>
            <p>The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I
<br/>say, for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness,
<br/>and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure.
<br/>The eternal click-clack, click-clack, click-clack, of the clock
<br/>was the most melodious of music in my ears, and occasion-
<br/>ally even put me in mind of the grateful sermonic harangues
<br/>of Dr. Olapod. Then there were the great figures upon
<br/>the dial-plate—how intelligent, how intellectual, they all
<br/>looked ! And presently they took to dancing the Mauzurka,
<br/>and I think it was the figure V who performed the most to
<br/>my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady of breeding.
<br/>None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in
<br/>her motions. She did the pirouette to admiration—whirl-
<br/>ing round upon her apex. I made an endeavor to hand her
<br/>a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her exer-
<br/>tions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my
<br/>lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed ! The bar had
<br/>buried itself two inches in my neck. I was aroused to a
<br/>sense of exquisite pain. I prayed for death, and, in the agony
<br/>of the moment, could not help repeating those exquisite vers-
<br/>es of the poet Miguel De Cervantes:	</p>
Vanny Buren, tan escondida
Query no te senty venny	
Pork and pleasure, delly morry	
Nommy, torny, darry, widdy !
            <p>But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed suf- 
<br/>ficient to startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the 
<br/>cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from 
their sockets. While I was thinking how I should possibly
<br/> manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head,
<br/> and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the
<br/> rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building.
<br/> The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of
<br/> independence and contempt with which it regarded me after
<br/> it was out. There it lay in the gutter just under my nose,
<br/> and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had
<br/> they not been disgusting. Such a winking and blinking
<br/> were never before seen. This behaviour on the part of my
<br/> eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its
<br/> manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also ex-
<br/> ceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which al-
<br/>ways exists between two eyes of the same head, however far
<br/>apart. I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whe-
<br/>ther I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly
<br/>thing that lay just under my nose. I was presently relieved,
<br/>however, by the dropping out of the other eye. In falling it
<br/>took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fel-
<br/>low. Both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth I 
<br/>was very glad to get rid of them.</p>
         <p>The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck,
<br/>and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through. My
<br/>sensations were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a
<br/> few minutes, at farthest, I should be relieved from my disa-
<br/> greeable situation. And in this expectation I was not at all
<br/> deceived. At twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon
<br/>precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently
<br/>far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of
<br/>my neck. I was not sorry to see the head which had occa-
<br/>sioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final se-
<br/>paration from my body. It first rolled down the side of the
<br/>steeple, then lodged, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and
<br/>then made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the
<br/> street.</p>
            <p>I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the
<br/>most singular—nay of the most mysterious, the most perplex-
<br/> ing and incomprehensible character. My senses were here
<br/>and there at one and the same moment. With my head I
<br/>imagined, at one time, that I the head, was the real Signora
<br/> Psyche Zenobia—at another I felt convinced that myself, the
<br/>body, was the proper identity. To clear my ideas upon this
<br/>topic I felt in my pocket for my snuff-box, but, upon getting
<br/>it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents
<br/>in the ordinary manner, I became immediately aware of my
<br/>peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once down to my
<br/>head. It took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled
<br/>me an acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterwards it
<br/>made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly with-
<br/>out ears. I gathered enough, however, to know that it was
<br/>astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circum-
<br/>stances. In the concluding sentences it quoted the noble
<br/>words of Ariosto—</p>
            Il pover hommy che non sera corty
And have a combat tenty erry morty.
<p>thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the com-
<br/>bat, not perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest
<br/>the battle with inextinguishable valor. There was nothing
<br/>now to prevent my getting down from my elevation, and I
<br/>did so. What it was that Pompey saw so very peculiar
<br/>in my appearance I have never yet been able to find out.
<br/>The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shut his two
<br/>eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids.
<br/>Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring for
<br/>the staircase and disappeared. I hurled after the scoun-
<br/>drel those vehement words of Demosthenes—</p>
         <a href="#p7"/>
         <div class="ab">Andrew O' Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,</div>
         <p>and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed!
<br/>the shaggy-haired Diana. Alas ! what horrible vision af-
<br/>fronted my eyes ? Was that a rat I saw skulking into his
<br/>hole ? Are these the picked bones of the little angel who
<br/>has been cruelly devoured by the monster ? Ye Gods! and
<br/>what do I behold—is that the departed spirit, the shade, the
<br/>ghost of my beloved puppy, which I perceive sitting with
<br/>a grace so melancholy, in the corner ? Harken ! for she
<br/>speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of Schiller—</p>
            "Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun
            Duk she ! duk she !”
<div class="ab">Alas !—and are not her words too true ?</div>
And if I died at least I died
For thee—for thee.
<p>Sweet creature ! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf
<br/>Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the un-
<br/>happy Signora Psyche Zenobia ?	Alas—nothing!	I have
  <br/>done.</p>

Where the river ever floweth,
Where the green grass ever groweth.
Where each star most faintly gloweth,
Do I wander on;
My thick pulses hastily beating.
My quick glances now retreating,
And, with bold advance, now meeting.
Shadows of the gone !
Lonely, by that lovely river,
Where the moon-lit blossoms quiver,
Do I wander on forever,
Musing on the past;
When the weary moon descendeth.
When each pals star earthward bendeth.
Then my soul strong memories sendeth,—

  Joys too bright to last!
  She, earth’s bright and loveliest flower,
Spirit, cooped in mortal bower,
She, whose voice alone bad power
O’er my soul, is gone!
Vain, oh! vain, are tears and wailing.
Fierce deep grief is unavailing,
Yet are they my heart assailing,—
Proud heart, never won !
By that river, ever flowing.
With heaven’s light upon her glowing.
Sometimes comes she to me, showing
Things past and to come.
  And we wander on. caressing,
While the mute earth sheds her blessing
Happy in that dim possessing,
Spirits in the gloom !
Were it not for that dim meeting.
Were it not for that dark greeting.
Its own core my wild heart eating,
Soon would turn to clay.
Now along that lonely river.
Lonely do I wander ever,
Where the nightly blossoms shiver,—
Dark and sad as they !</div>

         <div>
            <div class="head">The Coming of the Mammoth—the Funeral of Time, and
<br/>other Poems, by Henry B. Hirst, Boston: Philips &amp;
<br/>Sampson.</div>
            <p>Mr. Hirst is a young lawyer of Philadelphia—admitted to
<br/>practice, we believe, about two years ago, and already deriv-
<br/>ing a very respectable income from his profession. Some
<br/>years since, his name was frequency seen in the content-
<br/>tables of our Magazines, but latterly the duties of his pro-
<br/>fession seem to have withdrawn him from literary pursuits.
<br/>He has, nevertheless, done quite right in collecting his fugi-
<br/>tive poems, and giving them to the public in a convenient
<br/>and durable form. The day has happily gone by when a
<br/>practitioner at the bar has anything to fear from its being un-
<br/>derstood that he is capable of inditing a good sonnet.</p>
            <p>We have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Hirst has not
<br/>only given indication of poetical genius, but that he has
<br/>composed some very commendable poems. His imagination
<br/>is vigorous, bold, and at the same time delicate. His sense
<br/>of the true provinces of poetical art is remarkably keen and
<br/>discriminating, and his versification is superior to that of
<br/>any American poet. We perhaps should qualify this latter
<br/>remark by observing that his knowledge of the principles of
<br/>the metrical art is more profound and more accurate than
<br/>that of any American poet—but that his knowledge too fre-
<br/>quently leads him into the pedantry of hyperism. He is apt
<br/>to overdo a good thing. He insists upon rhythmical and me-
<br/>trical effects until they cease to have any effect at all—or
<br/>until they give to his compositions an air of mere oddity.—
<br/>His other defects are, chiefly, a want of constructive ability,
<br/>occasional extravagance of expression, and a far more than
<br/>occasional imitativeness. This last sin, is, in poetry, never to
<br/>be forgiven, and we are sorry to say that Mr. Hirst is inor-
<br/>dinately given to it. There is not a single poem in the beau-
<br/>tifully printed volume before us which does not remind us,
<br/>instantly, of some other composition. If we except some
<br/>rhythmical effects (for which the author deserves great
<br/>praise) there is nothing in the book which is fairly entitled
<br/>to be called original, either in its conception, execution, or
<br/>manner, as a whole. Of detached thoughts, nevertheless,
<br/>there are many very striking ones which are quite new, for
<br/>any evidence that we have to the contrary.</p>
            <p>As very usually happens in a case of this kind, the lead-
<br/>ing and longest poem of the collection is the least worthy of
<br/>notice. It is called “The Coming of the Mammoth,” and,
<br/>to say nothing of its being a mere paraphrase, in all its most
<br/>striking points, of Mr. Mathews’ “ Behemoth,” is feebly and
<br/>incoherently narrated—narrated, indeed, very much as a
<br/>schoolboy would narrate it. In fact, we understand that it
<br/>is one of the earliest compositions of the author, who began
<br/>to write at a very immature age.</p>
            <p>The story runs simply thus. The aborigines are suddenly
<br/>startled from the quiet of ages, by the apparition of “ my-
<br/>riad forms” of the mammoths. These creatures carry death
<br/>and desolation every where—destroying vegetation, and ani-
<br/>mal life wherever they pass. The extravagance with which
<br/>their nature is delineated, may be instanced by one stanza:</p>
  We saw them hunt the buffalo,
And crush them with their tusks of steel;
The mountains rocking to and fro
Like trees that in the tempest reel,
When passed their herds; and lake and river
A draught of theirs made dry forever.
<p>The aborigines themselves fall a prey and are reduced to
<br/>a small band, when they bethink them of supplicating the
<br/>aid of Moneddo (Manitou) who forthwith attacks the rava-<a href="#p8"/>
  gers with lightning, and destroys them all but one.</p>
Bolt rushed on bolt till, one by one,
Howling in agony, they died,
Save him, the fiercest! And alone
He stood—almost a God in pride—
Then with a loud defying yell
Leapt, like a shaft, o’er hill and dell.
<p>He flies at great speed ; the lightnings and the Indians
<br/>still pursuing. He reaches the Mississippi—leaps it at one
<br/>bound (possibly at a point not very far from the source)
<br/>and is at last brought up by the Rocky Mountains—but only
<br/>for a few moments—he ascends the highest peak—throws
<br/>rocks and trees “ in the face of God ” and fairly defies him,
<br/>until at length the “ mightiest spirits ” are summoned to
<br/>put an end to the contest:</p>
  They heard : with one tremendous crash
Down on the Mammoth’s forehead came
A surging sea of withering flame.
  Earth trembled to its core ; and weak
But unsubdued the Mammoth leapt
Furiously from that lofty peak
  To where the dark blue ocean swept.
Down ! down ! The startled waters sever ;
Then roll above him—and forever!
<p>Our readers will agree with us that from the summit of
<br/>the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, is a tolerably long leap 
<br/>even for a Mammoth—although he had had some previous 
<br/>practice in jumping the Mississippi.</p>
            <p>We are not extravagant in saying (are we?) that the 
<br/> "Coming of the Mammoth” which might as well have 
<br/>been called the “ Coming and the Going of the Mammoth” 
<br/>is the most preposterous of all the preposterous poems ever 
<br/>deliberately printed by a gentleman arrived at the years of
<br/>discretion. Nor has it one individual point of redeeming
<br/>merit. Had Mr. Hirst written only this we should have
<br/>thrown his book to the pigs without comment.</p>
            <p>“ The Funeral of Time" is a forcible allegory, very indis-
    <br/>tinctly made out, but well versified in some respects, and
    <br/>filled with majestic images—although disfigured, too often,
    <br/>by something even more mad than Nat Leeism.</p>
            <p>“ Isabelle ” is the finest ballad ever written in this coun-
      <br/>try, and but for its obvious and no doubt intentional imita-
      <br/>tions, might be called one of the best ever written anywhere.
      <br/>It is indeed exceedingly difficult to understand how the
      <br/>author of such trash as “ The Mammoth ” could be at the
      <br/>same time author of anything so widely different as “Isa-
      <br/>belle.” Its simplicity is exquisite—its conduct could not be
      <br/>improved—and its versification (within the narrow limits
    <br/>designed) is full of original force. We quote (unconnected-
ly) a few of the best quatrains:</p>
A lustrous maid was Isabelle,
And quiet as a brooding bird ;
She never thought of passion’s spell—
Of love she never heard ;
But in her lonely chamber sat,
Sighing the weary hours away
From morn till flitting of the bat
Around the turrets gray.
And trembling with a strange unrest—
A yearning for—she knew not what ;
She only knew her heaving breast
Was heavy with its lot.
At last she passed to womanhood,
And sat her down on Beauty’s throne,
A statue with a beating heart
Beneath a breast of stone.
Her lustrous eyes grew large with love ;
Her cheeks with passion flushed and bright;
Her lips, whereon no bee might rove
Undrunken with delight,
Were, &amp;c.
She felt she bad not lived in vain ;
She saw the Eden of her dreams
Close round her, and she stood again
Beside its silver streams.
The servants followed her with their eyes,
And prayed the virgin that her hours
Might ever pass under azure skies
And over parterres of flowers.
  <p>“ Geraldine ” is a far better poem than “ Isabelle ” and is
<br/>unquestionably the best in the volume. It is, however, in
<br/>manner a palpable imitation of Tennyson. In justice to Mr.
<br/>Hirst we quote it in full:</p>
The martins twitter round the eaves,
The swift adown the chimney glides,
The bees are humming ’mid the leaves
Along the garden side ;
The robin whistles in the wood,
The linnet on the vane,
And down the alder-margined lane
The throstle sings, and by the flood
The plover pipes again.
  But ah—alas alas ! no more
Their merry melodies delight ;
No more along the river’s shore
I watch the swallow’s flight:
And bees may hum and birds may sing,
And silver streamlets shine,
But on the rocks I sit and pine
Unheeding all; for thought will cling
To naught but Geraldine.
  Oh, Geraldine ! my life, my love !

  I only wander where we met
In emerald days, when blue above
The skies were o’er us set—
  Along the glen and o’er the vale
And by the willow tree
I wander where at even with thee
I sang the song and told the tale
Of olden chivalry.
  I stand beneath the sombre pines
That darken all thy father’s hall,
Begirt with noisome ivy vines
That shroud me like a pall.
  Aye there !—where ruin frowns around !
Until the cock doth crow
I watch thy window-panes below,
Upon the sodden blackened ground
  Where nothing good will grow.
I’ve watched thy lattice as before
To see the glimmer dimly pass,
(When thou wouldst open thy chamber door)
Of lamp-light on the glass ;
But none from out thy lattice peeps,
And all within is gloom,
And silent as a vacant tomb,
Save when a bat affrighted cheeps
In some deserted room.
Why comest thou not? Night after night,
For many a long and weary year,
’Neath many and many a May-moon’s light,
I’ve waited for thee here.
Aye blackest night and wildest storm
When frowning in the sky
Have looked on me with lightning eye,
And charnel figures round my form
Have gleamed and hurried by.
  Why comest thou not ? or wilt thou soon ?
The crimson sun doth wax and wane
Day after day; the yellow moon
Gildeth thy casement pane
Night after night; the stars are pale
Expecting thee ; the breeze
Rustling among the dreary trees
Sighs for thee with a woful wail
Who art beyond the seas.
  They tell me thou wilt never come—
Alas ! that thou art cold and dead,
And slumbering in the green sea-foam
Upon some coral bed :—
That shriekingly thy ship went down
Beneath the wailing wave,
And none were near to hear or save—
And then they weep to see me frown—
To hear me groan and rave.
Thou dead ?—no, no !—it cannot be !
For if thou wast, thy ghost had kept
The solemn trist thou madest with me
When all save passion slept—
  Thy ghost had come and greeted me
And bade me be at rest;
And long ere this upon my breast
The clod had fain : and I with thee
W'ere roaming ’mid the blest.
<p>  “ The Unseen River" is musical, but has the defect of
  <br/>being imperfectly made out. Few persons will understand <a href="#p7"/>
that by the river always heard but never seen, until the tra-
<br/>veller is overtaken by death, it is the poet’s intention to
<br/>typify Happiness. We quote a fine stanza of which the
<br/>whole is very poetic (in the best sense) and of which the
<br/>concluding line is a specimen of exquisite versification.</p>
From the valley—from a river
Which, like many a silver quiver.
Through the landscape stole in light:—
From the bushes, shrubs and blossoms—
Flowers unfolding fragrant bosoms—
Curled the shadows out of sight,
Fading like a ghost in air; and ever the river rippled bright.
  <p>“ The Burial of Eros" is a very effective allegorical poem
<br/>—but all allegories are contemptible:—at least the only two
<br/>which are not contemptible (The Pilgrim’s Progress and
<br/>The Fairy Queen) are admired in despite of themselves (as
<br/>allegories) and in the direct ratio of the possibility of keep-
<br/>ing the allegorical meaning out of sight.</p>
            <p>“ The Sea of the Mind ” is another allegory, or (what is
<br/>less objectionable) an allegorical enigma. It is miserably
<br/>indefinite. Its only merit lies in detached thoughts, and in
<br/>its admirable management of the trochaic rhythm. The
<br/>metre is heptameter catalectic—consisting of seven (tro-
<br/>chaic) feet and a final coesura, equivalent. The trochees
<br/>are finely varied, now and then, with dactyls; only the
<br/>most forcible consonants are employed; the richest vowel
<br/>sounds abound; and all the effects of alliteration, with other
<br/>rhythmical effects less common, are skilfully introduced.—
<br/>For example;</p>
Silvery the ocean singeth over sands of pearly glow ;
Under its surface shapes are gliding—gliding last or sailing slow—
Shapes of strange supernal beauty, floating through a fairy wave—
Fairer, purer, lovelier, brighter than the streams that Iram lave.
  <p>“The Birth of a Poet” is somewhat like an imitation
<br/>from John Neal's poem of the same title; the commence-
<br/>ment, especially, is stolen.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hirst’s conception throughout is fantastical—not to
<br/>say absurd. The poem, however, is redeemed by one re-
<br/>markably well-managed quatrain:</p>
Music like what the poet hears
When, wrapt in harmony, he wings
His soul away through argent spheres,
And back their melody brings.
<p>The concluding anapoest here beautifully and most appro-
<br/>priately varies the iambic rhythm—making the sound “echo
<br/>the sense.”</p>
            <p>“ Everard Grey ” is a superb specimen of dactylic trime-
<br/>ter, catalectic on one syllable—three dactyls and one equiva-
<br/>lent coesura. E. g.—</p>
Time it has passed; and the lady is pale—
Pale as the lily that lolls on the gale:
Weary and worn she hath waited for years
Keeping her grief evergreen with her tears :—
Years will she tarry—for cold is the clay
Fettering the form of her Everard Grey.

  <p>“ The Fringilla Melodia ” is truly beautiful throughout,
<br/>possessing a natural force and grace (without effort) which
<br/>would do honor to the most noted poet in the land. We
<br/>quote the first quatrain :</p>
Happy song-sparrow that on woodland side
Or by the meadow sits, and ceaseless sings
His mellow roundelay in russet pride,
Owning no care between his wings.
<p>The “sits” here is not ungrammatical; the sparrow is
<br/>not invoked, The construction is nevertheless a little equi-
<br/>vocal.</p>
            <p>“The Coming of Autumn" is spirited—but is a little too
  <br/> much in the Old King Cole way.</p>
            <p>“ The Autumn Wind ” has a noble beginning, and as no-
  <br/>ble an end—but as a whole is unimpressive.</p>
            <p>“Eleanore” has no merit at all except the effect of the
<br/>constantly recurring refrain, “ Eleanore !” and this is taken
<br/>'from Tennyson’s “ Oriana.”</p>
            <p>“ Mary ” has some fine passages—e. g.</p>
He watched each motion of her rustling dress,
Each lustrous movement of her liquid eyes—
Envied the air its undisturbed caress
Of her whose presence was his Paradise.

  <p>“To an Old Oak;” “To E—with a Withered Rose;”
<br/>and “The Death-Song of the Nightingale” have nothing
<br/>in them remarkable—“ Eulalie Vere ” nothing beyond the 
<br/>barroques lines,</p>
Cheeks where the loveliest of lustres reposes
On valleys of lilies and mountains of roses.
<p>“ To the American Sky-Lark ” is professedly an imitation
<br/>of Bryant's “Waterfowl:” we need, therefore, say nothing
<br/>about it.</p>
            <p>“ Ellena ” has some glowing thoughts. For example,</p>
at her word
The hushed air shook, with human passion stirred.
<p>And again:</p>
a maniac tune
Rang in mine ears, like songs sung in a swoon.
<p>“ The Coming of Night ” is excellent throughout—if we
  <br/>except the grammatical error in the ante-penultimate line.</p>
Oh Blessed Night that comes to rich and poor.
<p>Here are two admirable quatrains:</p>
Forest and field are still
Nature seems wrapt in slumber; wholly dumb,
Save when the frog’s deep bass or beetle's bum,
Or wailing whippoorwill,
Disturb her weary ear,
Or the far falling of the rippling rill
That sings, while leaping down the silent hill,
Her dreamless sleep to cheer.
<p>“ Violet” is merely an absurd imitation of Barry Cornwall’s
most absurd Tom-Foolery.</p>
            <p>“ A Gift” is well versified, but common-place.</p>
            <p>“ The Owl" opens with too finely imaginative
  <br/>stanzas:</p>
When twilight fades and evening falls
Alike on tree and tower,
And silence, like a pensive maid,
Walks round each slumbering bower;
When fragrant flowerets fold their leaves,
And all is still in sleep,
The horned owl on moonlit wing
Flies from the donjon keep.
And he calls aloud “ too-whit! too-whoo !”
And the nightingale is still,
And the pattering step of the hurrying hare
Is hushed upon the bill;
And he crouches low in the dewy grass
As the lord of the night goes by,
Not with a loudly whirring wing
But like a lady's sigh.
<p>Every critic—at least every poetical critic—will admit
<br/>that the images in these two stanzas are such as only a true
<br/>poet could conceive. At the same time they are embodied
<br/>with much art.</p>
            <p>“A Song’’ and “Mutius Sccevola” have no particular
    merit. “ The Forsaken” ends with nerve:</p>
Well, go thy way! and never wake
The feeblest memory of me,
To wring thy worthless heart! I break
Thy chains and set thee free.
Thou to thy mirth ! I to my gloom !
Health to the coldest of the twain !
And mine—not thine—the iron doom
Of having loved in vain.
  <p>“ The Lament of Adam” is chiefly remarkable for the ef-
<br/>fect of its versification—not altogether original, to be sure,
<br/>but rare, and very forcible when well-managed. The
<br/>rhythm is dactylic, the lines terminating with equivalent
<br/>caesuras. The metre is generally tetrameter, catalectic on
<br/>one syllable (the exsura forming the catalexis)—but the<a href="#p10"/>
               <br/>lines increase towards the closing of the stanzas, and in one
    <br/>instance are hexameter catalectic. We give the last stanza:</p>
Life hath its pleasures—but perishing they as the flowers :
Sin hath its sorrows; and, sighing we turned from those bowers:
Bright were the angels behind with their falchions of heavenly 
flame :
Dark was the desolate desert before us, but darker the depth of our
shame.
<p>Here the alliteration is too obvious—quite overdone, and
<br/>is an instance of the hyperism to which we alluded in the
<br/>beginning of our notice.</p>
            <p>“ The Statue-Love” is not very good.</p>
            <p>“ May” is a remarkably line poem, with an exquisite close:</p>
  ---the passionate bard
Wanders away through sylvan lonelinesses,
Alive with love—his heart a silver river
On which the swan of song floats gracefully for ever.
<p>“Dramatic Fragments” are worth nothing. “ The Song 
<br/>of the Scald Biorne” is, to our astonishment, badly versified. 
<br/>How comes Mr. Hirst in an anapaestic rhythm, or in any
<br/>rhythm, with such a verse as—</p>
My iron hand on her arm when before her I knelt ?

  <p>“Summer” is quite feeble.</p>
            <p>Twenty well-constructed sonnets conclude the volume.
<br/>Among these, Bethlehem” and “ Dead Man’s Island” may
<br/>be cited as particularly good : but by way of finale to our re-
<br/>view we quote “ Astarte” as the best.</p>
Thy lustre, heavenly star ! shines ever on me.
I, trembling like Endymion over-bent
By dazzling Dian, when with wonderment
He saw her crescent light the Latmian lea :
  And like a Naiad’s sailing on the sea,
Floats thy fair form before me: the azure air
Is all ambrosial with thy hyacinth hair:
While round thy lips the moth in airy glee
Hovers, and hums in dim and dizzy dreams,
Drunken with odorous breath: thy argent eyes
(Twin planets swimming through love’s lustrous skies)
Are mirrored in my heart’s serenest streams—
Such eyes saw Shakespeare, flashing, bold and bright,
When Queenly Egypt rode the Nile at night.</div>

         <p>The American Review for July has some very admirable
<br/>papers, among which we notice especially “ Marshal Mac-
<br/>donald by the clever author of “ Letters from Italy,” and a
<br/>discriminative review of Mr. Griswold’s “ Poets and Poetry
<br/>of England,” by Mr. Whipple, undoubtedly one of our finest
<br/>critics. We are truly delighted to find him so keenly appre-
<br/>ciating the magnificent genius of Tennyson. This number
<br/>contains, also, a poem, “ The Gods of Old" which does high
<br/>credit to its author, Mr. Wm. Wallace. Speaking of it the
<br/>editor of the Review says:—</p>
         <p>The following highly imaginative poem adds a third to the list on
<br/>a beautilul and suggestive subject. It is a little remarkable that nei.
<br/>ther of them bears any resemblance in the conception or execution.
<br/>Miss Barrett’s idea is the absolute death of the ancient Divinities—
<a href="#p11"/>
Schiller laments the decay of their influence—the following Ode is
<br/>based on their continued existence as poetical creations which delight
<br/>the human mind.—</p>
         <p>It cannot be doubted that Mr. Wallace's conception is the
<br/>best of the three, and he has handled it in a masterly man-
<br/>ner. We quote the concluding stanza.</p>
  V.
Like far off stars that glimmer in a cloud,
Deathless, O Gods ! shall ye illume the past:
To ye the Poet-Voice will cry aloud,
Faithful among the faithless to the last:—
Ye must not die !
Long as the dim robes of the Ages trail
O’er Delphi’s steep or Tempe’s flowery vale—
An awful Throng—
Borne upward on the sounding wings of Song
That cast the Beautiful o’er Land, o’er Sea,
Ye shall not die :
Though Time and storm your calm, old temples rend,
And, rightly, men to the “ One Only” bend—
Your Realm is Memory !
<p>The Knickerbocker for July has also some meritorious con-
<br/>tributions—but neither man nor devil can dissuade its editor
<br/>from a monthly farrago of type so small as to be nearly in-
<br/>visible, and so stupid as to make us wish it were quite so.
<br/>In three lines devoted to the “Broadway Journal” intended
<br/>to be complimentary, we believe, although we sincerely hope
<br/>not, he makes use of what he supposes to be a French pro-
<br/>verb, and writes it Chacun a son gout, taking great pains to
<br/>place a grave accent on the verb, mistaking it for the prepo-
<br/>sition, and complimenting the hard c with a cedilla. Within
<br/>the compass of the same three lines, he talks about a nil ad-
<br/>mirari critic ; some person, we presume, having quizzed
<br/>him with the information that the meaning of nil admirari
<br/>is " to admire nothing.” We certainly do not admire Mr.
<br/>Clarke—nor his wig—but the true English of the Latin
<br/>phrase is “to wonder at nothing,” and we plead guilty to
<br/>having wondered at nothing since we have found the Knick-
<br/>erbocker sinking day by day in the public opinion in despite
<br/>of the brilliant abilities and thoroughly liberal education of

<br/>this establishment, Donizetti’s opera La Favorite, Auber’s
<br/>Le Domino Noir, and Mayerbeer’s Robert Le Diable, have
<br/>been produced, each of them with considerable success.
<br/>Regardnig the audience, one peculiarity must be observed
<br/>and commented upon by everybody. Although the cress
<br/>circle is frequently crowded at a dollar, and the upper tier
<br/>filled to overflowing at fifty cents admission, yet the doomed
<br/>parquette rarely contains more than forty persons, thus prov-
<br/>ing beyond dispute the wholesomeness of the advice proffered 
<br/>in our last number. If the price of admission to the par-
<br/>quette were reduced to fifty cents, the receipts of the house
<br/>would be increased from fifty to a hundred dollars per night.
<br/>We should advise Mr. Davis to drop the dignity and look
<br/>to the profit. La Favorite is the first on our list. It is a
<br/>grand opera seria, and contains many striking beauties pe-
<br/>culiar to Donizetti. The Andantes are generally of a chaste,
<br/>sweet, and tender character; and if they do not possess any
<br/>originality particularly striking, they are yet earnest, and
<br/>full of passion. There is a quartette in the second act, we 
<br/>believe, which is a most charming subject, but its close is
<br/>strained, inharmonious, and by no means appropriate. The
<br/>chorus of Signori in the third act is characteristic, spirited, 
<br/>and full of point. It was well sung—indeed we might say,
<br/>admirably well: short, stern, and precise, the manner was
<br/>worthy of the matter. Indeed, we can not praise its per-
      formance too highly, and the public were of our opinion,
<br/>for they encored it upon each occasion. The finales do not
<br/>call for much remark. They ate chiefly noticeable for great
<br/>noise and want of clearness. The instrumentation is, gen-
<br/>erally, very poor and thin, but some passages of exceeding
<br/>beauty relieved what else would have been monotonous
<br/>insipidity.</p>
            <p>The plot of the opera is full of dramatic interest and strik-
<br/>ing situations. The scene is laid in Spain during the reign
<br/>of Charles XI. and the story turns upon a (supposed) circum-
<br/>stance in the life of his famous favorite, Leonora de Guseman.</p>
            <p>Fernand, a youth of patrician birth, is a neophite in the
<br/>monastesy. He sees Leonora as she comes to pray in the
<br/>chapel, and becomes enamored of her. She is also struck
<br/>by his noble appearance, and determines that he shall not
<br/>become a monk. She procures for hint a captain’s commis-
<br/>sion, and he leaves the monastery. Fernand is introduced
<br/>to Lenora at court the next day, but is not aware of her po-
<br/>sition with the king. They become deeply attached, and
<br/>are only aroused from their dream of love by an order for
<br/>Fernand to join the army. He leaves her with regret, but
<br/>returns covered with the glory which his daring courage and
<br/>good fortune in the wars have won for him. The king dis-
<br/>tinguishes him with extraordinary favor; and Fernand embol-
<br/>dened by his kindness, asks for the hand of Leonora. This,
<br/>too, the king grants; and they are wedded. On their re-
<br/>return from the alter, he seeks for congratulation from his
<br/>friends; but they turn from him with sullen looks and ges-
<br/>tures. He asks an explanation. They tell him he has mar-
<br/>ried the king’s mistress. He is overwhelmed with astonish-
<br/>ment, sorrow, and anger. At this moment the king and Le-
<br/>onora enter. Fernand casts the king’s gifts on the ground,
<br/>repudiates his wife, and rushes out with the friendly monk.
<br/>We next see he him as a shaven monk, he having assumed
<br/>the cowl on the discovery of Leonora’s falsehood. Leonora,
<br/>humbled and repentant, leaves the court, and, arriving at
<br/>the monastery, distinguishes Fernald’s voice among the sing-
<br/>ers. Shrieking out his name, she falls upon the steps of
<br/>cross, overcome by surprise and fatigue. He rushes from
<br/>the church ; discovers Leonora ; a reconciliation takes place,
<br/>and she dies in his arms, happy in being loved and forgiven.</p>
            <p>Although we sincerely acknowledge Calve to be an es-
<br/>pecial favourite with us, yet are we compelled to say that
<br/>in Leonora de Guzman she disappointed us. We did not expect
<br/>much, but even our moderate expectations were unfulfilled.
<br/>She sang with her usual lightness, delicacy, and finish ;
<br/>she dressed to admiration, and she looked very charming,
<br/>but she was by no means the character she assumed. She
<br/>lacked dignity of carriage, force and earnestness—in expres-
<br/>sion and feeling. In the lighter operas of Auber and Doni-
<br/>zetti, she has but one rival this side the ocean, but she
<br/>should not attempt opera seria.</p>
            <p>Arnaud, as we predicted, is gaining rapidly in public fa-
<br/>vour. His pure school of singing could not fail to make
<br/>ample amends for the unpleasant quality of his voice. He
<br/>sung throughout in a most artistical style. His acting lacks
<br/>passion, but it is scarcely observable, so deep and earnest
<br/>is the feeling he imparts to his singing.</p>
            <p>M. Garry, also, fully justifies our favorable opinion. He oc-
<br/>casionally indulges in a coarse and forced method of delivery,
<br/>but as a general thing, his style is good, emphatic, and
<br/>earnest.</p>
            <p>M. Douvy, as the priest, acquitted himself in a very cre-
<br/>ditable manner, with the exception that occasionally he was
<br/>most painfully out of tune.</p>
            <p>The band, as usual, formed the most delightful feature in
<a href="#p12"/>
the evening’s entertainment. Its performance was admira- 
<br/>ble throughout the evening. Prevost did all that a fine leader
<br/>should do, and the band seconded his efforts to the very
<br/>letter.</p>
            <p>The opera was, in every respect, beautifully put upon the 
<br/>stage. It forms a splendid contrast to the usual style of 
<br/>producing operas in this city. Let those who bring out
<br/>English opera bear this in mind.</p>
            <p>Le Domino Noir met with distinguished success when 
<br/>the French company were here, two years ago. The music
<br/>indeed is of that light and fascinating character which hits 
<br/>the popular taste at once. It abounds with delicious melo- 
<br/>dies, and clever concerted pieces, whose quaintness and 
<br/>originality possess a charm, which increases in power the
<br/>more familiar the hearer becomes with the music. Auber
<br/>is a great and true artist, he is not appreciated, out of Paris,
<br/>as he should be, but the time is fast approaching when he
<br/>will be as dear to the lovers of music in this country as a
<br/>familiar household god. The instrumentation of Le Domino
<br/>Noir is light, sparkling, novel and ingenious, and was exe-
<br/>cuted by the orchestra in a manner worthy of its excellence. </p>
            <p>Mad'lle Calve was in this opera most entirely at home, 
<br/>whether as the lady or the simple country maiden ; in the
<br/>one she was all grace, elegance and refinement—in the other,
<br/>simple, arch, and natural. Her singing was equally to be
<br/>praised throughout, but more especially in the second act,
<br/>when repeated bursts of applause testified the delight and
<br/>approbation of the audience.</p>
            <p>Madame Cceuriot is also entitled to our warm commenda-
<br/>tion. She sang well, acted well, dressed well, and in an
<br/>unobtrusive manner, pleasing to behold, she wins her way 
<br/>swiftly and surely into popular favour.</p>
            <p>M. Coeuriot is the very perfection of a French lover. He
<br/>is the breathing semblance of many of Eugene Sue’s
<br/>metaphisical monstrosities. His impetuosity, though it may
<br/>come within probability, is so truly extravagant, that it be-
<br/>comes ridiculous ; we laugh where we should look sad, and
<br/>sympathize with him only as his folly places him in ludi-
<br/>crous positions. But we would not wish to seem to blame
<br/>M. Coeuriot for acting so naturally ; his is the praise—the
<br/>fault lies with the class which he so faithfully represents.
<br/>M. Coeuriot’s singing is also to be highly praised, for he uses
<br/>a voice not too good, like an accomplished artist, and ren-
<br/>ders with great fidelity all that the composer has apportioned
<br/>him. The choruses were well sung, and the ensemble was
<br/>highly gratifying. We hope to see this opera again.</p>
            <p>Of Meyerbeer’s great work, Robert le Dioble, we cannot
<br/>speak this week, for our notice of the French Company has
<br/>already extended beyond our usual limits. We will endavour
<br/>to notice it in our next. This much we can say, that it is
<br/>produced upon a magnificent scale, and has met with dis-
<br/>tinguished success, not more flattering than deserved.</p>
            <p>We earnestly advise all those of our musical friends who
<br/>have not heard this opera to make sure of the next perform-
<br/>ance, as it will be withdrawn after a short time.</p>
         </div>
         <div> 
            <div class="head">Mr. Fry’s Opera.</div>
            <p>—We regret not having time to attend to
<br/>the Philadelphia papers this week, but we will oblige those we
<br/>have received by noticing them in our next number. Their
<br/>attempts to puff up Mr Fry’s opera would be laughable were
<br/>they not so contemptible.</p>
            <p>We seem to be the special object of their sublime indig-
<br/>nation, and they fume and rave at us with a ferocity truly
<br/>entertaining. The only argument they use, however, to
<br/>prove that our criticism of poor Leonora was no criticism,
<br/>and to prove how impossible it is that we should be able to
    write a criticism, is the following. We beg our readers to
<br/>forbear laughing while we state it, for the charge is a grave
<br/>charge. The reason why we have not, and why we cannot,
<br/>write a criticism is—that we eat beef! Serious as this
<br/>charge is, and likely as it is to affect our moral and intel-
<br/>lectual character, yet, in the beautiful simplicity of our na-
<br/>ture, we acknowledge its truth. We do eat beef; and, by
<br/>a singular coincidence, we were dining on beef when the
<br/>papers containing this exterminating charge reached our
<br/>residence. What appetite we had left, after reading them,
<br/>may be better imagined than described.</p>
            <p>If our modesty were not too painfully oppressive, we
<br/>would suggest that the nerve, bone, and sinew of the criti-
<br/>cisms which some folks find so difficult to digest, owe some-
<br/>thing to our partiality to that estimable beast from which
<br/>that nourishing article of food, called beef, is derived ; and
<br/>were we not singularly fearful of disturbing the naturally
<br/>amiable tempers of our Philadelphia brethren, we would, in
<br/>all kindness, suggest that, judging from the internal evi-
<br/>idences afforded by their writings, the sustenance of our
<br/>contemporaries consisted of water melons and weak gruel.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge ourselves overcome ; for, out of all the
<br/>absurdities which they have indited, they have, at last, hit
<br/>upon one startling and important truth. But if we are hon-
<br/>est and candid enough to admit that we da live on roasts,
<br/>surely our adversaries, who labour so hard and so vainly to
<br/>write up a reputation, with like ingenuousnous, will ac-
<br/>knowledge having frequently feasted on Fries !</p>
            <p>The foregoing remarks were in type last week, but were
<br/>unfortunately crowded out. It was our intention to refer, at
<br/>length, to two of the Philadelphia papers, so enviably pro-
<br/>minent in abusing us; but, on looking them through, we
<br/>find that they contain little else but vulgar personalities and
<br/>low abuse; and, as we cannot reply in the same strain, we
<br/>shall, after a few remarks, dismiss the subject for the present.</p>
            <p>The person who signs himself Colley Cibber, and accuses
<br/>us of being English and eating beef, commenced his defence
<br/>of Leonora in the most grandiloqnent style, talking of Me-
<br/>mory’s Lake, &amp;c., &amp;c., and promised, in his next communi-
<br/>cation, to analize, dissect, dismember—nay, to reduce our
<br/>criticism to very dust. Although Colley Cibber gave but
<br/>little evidence of common sense or moderate understanding
<br/>of his subject, we were in hopes that, what with friendly
<br/>promptings and laborious researches in Burrowes’ primer or
<br/>Hunter's instruction book, we say we hoped that the person
<br/>with the English alias wonld hit upon something which
<br/>would jastify a reply. But his second article is a ridiculous
<br/>rambling rhodomontade, without point, order, or argument.
<br/>It is evident that Mr. Cibber has read our critique udon Le-
<br/>onora, and has fallen upon no point on which he could found
<br/>a reasonable objection, or support a contrary argument. In
<br/>this dilemma, he has, fortunately as he supposes, run his
<br/>head against what he calls a contradiction in our critique.
<br/>We will quote his quotation, in order that he may have the
<br/>full benefit of his discovery, and for the purpose of allowing
<br/>our readers to judge themselves of (he vast analytical powers
<br/>of this critic upon critics:</p>
            <p>“ It is generally conceded that the great emotions which
<br/>agitate the human heart—love, jealousy, hatred, and revenge
<br/>—demand no conventional mode of expression ; they owe to
<br/>no rule their intensity of feeling ; they speak in a language
<br/>which is universal; and, whether it be the Spaniard or the
<br/>Englishman, the Italian or the German, these amotions
<br/>spring right up from the heart, and are dependent for the
<br/>truthfulness of expression upon the genius or inspiration of
<br/>the composer." Mr. Colley Cibber says: “Well, let that<a href="#p13"/>
pass; but see how this learned critic contradicts himself.”
<br/>Now for the contradiction. “There is a rule, however,
<br/>which is never departed from by composers of any talent—
<br/>a rule so natural that it must suggest itself to every reflecting
<br/>mind. It is, that all ballads, dances, and simple chorusses,
<br/>should be purely and entirely national. The national music
<br/>of every country is faithfully portrayed in its ballads and
<br/>dances; and if these do not partake of the national character,
<br/>the scene might as well be laid in Russia as in France, or
<br/>in China as in Spain.”</p>
            <p>Our readers, we believe, will be as much puzzled as we
<br/>have been to discover in what particular one quotation con-
<br/>tradicts the other. The truth is plain enough that Mr.
<br/>Somebody, alias Mr. Colley Cibber, undertook a task which
<br/>he had not the capacity to accomplish.</p>
            <p>Some papers have thrown out a doubt as to our having
<br/>been present at the performance of Leonora; others insinu-
<br/>ate that we were actuated, in our remarks, by ill feeling to-
<br/>wards the composer. To the first, we reply that we visited
<br/>Philadelphia for the express purpose of hearing the opera :
<br/>and to the last, that, having spoken to Mr. Fry but once,
<br/>and then only for five minutes, we could not possibly enter-
<br/>tain any ill will towards the gentleman. It is well known
<br/>to all with whom we spoke, previous to our visit to Phila-
<br/>delphia, how earnest we were in the hope of being able to
<br/>praise this work: nothing less would have induced us to in-
<br/>cur the expense and loss of time attendant upon the journey.
<br/>But, having heard it, we were bound to express ourself ac-
<br/>cording to its merits. We did so without fear and without
<br/>prejudice, and hence the fuss made by injudicious friends
<br/>and partizans.</p>

            <div class="head"> Pianofortes.</div>
            <p>—Last week we were requested by Mr. T.
<br/>H. Chambers to call at his store, 385 Broadway, and ex-
<br/>amine a pianoforte which he was about to send into Virginia.
<br/>We found the instrument everyway worthy our attention.
<br/>Its compass was seven octaves, and its quality of tone was
<br/>very fine, rich and powerful, clear and brilliant, and equal
<br/>throughout the scale. The touch was light, but so well
<br/>balanced, that almost any amount of power could be pro-
<br/>cured. The case was elegant and carefully finished—in
<br/>short, it was in every way a fine instrument, and the gen-
<br/>tleman who has purchased it will find that he has invested
<br/>his money to advantage.</p>

         <div class="head">TOWN AMUSEMENT IN SUMMER.
THE ETHIOPIAN MUSIC.</div>
         <p>Though the fashionable American world would fain per-
<br/>suade us, that ‘ all the world is out of town,’ at this season,
  <br/>in palpable imitation of the English world of fashion, yet,
<br/>as the streets appear tolerably full, and as the public places
<br/>are not altogether empty : as we happen to know a few
<br/>ladies and as many gentlemen, who happen to be still re-
<br/>maining in town; we take it for granted our readers may
<br/>know a few also, and hence, by a simple act of addition and
<br/>multiplication, a pretty fair body of intelligent, clever, social
<br/>persons may be collected, who require some rational public
<br/>amusements. To these we address this general and ram-
<br/>bling paper.</p>
         <p>The theatres proper, ought to be closed all the summer,
<br/>they are open until quite too late in the season. The extreme
<br/>heat, together with the blaze of light and a crowded audi-
<br/>ence, destroy any gratification to be derive from any perfor-
mances on the stage. The French company at the Park,
<br/>draw now select houses: chiefly of their countrymen and
<br/>countrywomen. But they will do better at Niblo’s by-and
<br/>by, in a light, airy, open place, and with reduced price. The
<br/>Bowery and Chatham, ought to give way also, for the same
<br/>reason as the Park, to which might be added the rea-
<br/>sons that tragedy in hot weather is altogether too tropi-
<br/>cal, unless, it be the farce of that name. It is too exciting,
<br/>makes too much and too heavy demands on the attention and
<br/>feelings. So too of farces that makes one laugh too loud and
<br/>long. It is almost as bad as high tragedy, yet not so simu-
<br/>lating. Circus performances are a nuisance ; the least pub-
<br/>lic sympathy on the part of the audience converting the
<br/>contortions of the performers into absolute martyrdom. The
<br/>other actors deal too much in horse play.</p>
         <p>The museums would do well enough: they give you (at
<br/>the least) far more than the value of your entrance money,
<br/>but they are crowded to suffocation, and by the extreme ra-
<br/>dical party, the great unwashed and unterrified Democracy.</p>
         <p>If the legitimate drama be too heavy for summer, so is al-
<br/>most everything in the shape of intellectual amusement. Good
<br/>elocutionists, like Simmons and Mrs. Mowatt, draw select
<br/>audiences. Full lectures do not go down at all now. If they
<br/>do badly in January, they are dead failures in July.</p>
         <p>Vaudeville, the lightest farce, Fairy Spectacles, &amp;c., such
<br/>as Niblo gives one, are the only dramatic performances suited
<br/>to summer. Concerts, at Castle Garden, are best of all, out
<br/>of doors, and are, perhaps, at once, the healthiest and most
<br/>agreeable of all public amusements. And this brings us to
<br/>the principal topic we meant to touch upon.</p>
         <p>Ethiopian Melodies have been for the past year or two
<br/>unanimously popular. Last summer, in particular, the
<br/>Plantation Niggers threatened to overthrow Rossini himself,
<br/>and Wark in Steben, fairly competed, in popular esteem,
<br/>with una voce poco fa.</p>
         <p>Dandy Jim and Tom Rice, became the avowed rivals of
<br/>Auber and Mendelssohn. Nor could we tell, last summer,
<br/>where this enthusiasm would stop. But, now, the taste for
<br/>these native airs is on the decline, since we have been fed
<br/>on the foreign graces of the Italian opera during the winter.
<br/>Or rather, we ought perhaps to say that the liking for
<br/>this class of music, is settling down into a national fondness
<br/>for a certain species of homebred rustic melody. In truth,
<br/>the Ethiopian is our only national music, strictly; and the
<br/>sunny South, in both hemispheres, is the true region of mirth
<br/>and song and the dance—equally, in America and Europe, the
<br/>land of gallantry and generous qualities of all kinds ; the
<br/>home of hospitality ; the fountain of courtesy; the meridian
<br/>of luxury and voluptuousness.</p>
         <p>This school of music, for such it is fast becoming, is truly
<br/>national and truly democratic. It has its home among the
<br/>slaves, and fairly represents their amusements, character,
<br/>and social condition. It combines drollery with feeling; a
<br/>peculiar broad (almost burlesque) humor, with a natural vein
<br/>of pathos: of this mixed character are most of the songs,
<br/>while the dancing airs are as near perfection in their way
<br/>[we may call it a low way, if we please, and tell the truth,]
<br/>as any music in the world. The negro has an instinctive
<br/>love of music, a capital ear, and the most accurate idea of
<br/>lime. Without any scientific knowledge of the art, he will
<br/>whistle or fiddle an air, with the utmost precision, after hav-
<br/>ing heard it played a few times. He is thought to be all
<br/>the better musician, by many, from his (general) want of
<br/>individuality and proneness to imitation. To a certain point,
<br/>he is only clever, but never gets beyond it. The airs, com-
<br/>monly supposed to be indigenous, bear a model somewhere <a href="#p41"/>
among old English or Scotch songs, or hymn tunes, march-
<br/>es, etc. Yet some of the negro airs, are as old, as the first
<br/>settlement of Georgia by Oglethorpe: some may be older still.
<br/>The air of Gen’l Morris’ song, “On the Lake where droops
<br/>the Willow,” is called a Southern refrain ; yet it is only the
<br/>delightful Scotch original of “ Comin’ thro’ the Rye,” with
<br/>the character of the music altered by playing it, in slower
<br/>time, and thus giving a pathetic caste to an originally
<br/>sprightly air.</p>
         <p>In speaking of these negro songs, we must be understood
<br/>to refer to the airs, and not to the words commonly adapted
<br/>to them. In general, the libretto of the Ethiopean Opera,
<br/>is as fiat and tasteless, as that of the Stabat. The South is
<br/>still without its Metastasio.</p>
         <p>Get the airs ;—nothing of a hot summer’s evening can be
<br/>more delightfully soothing in the way of music, than Old Jar
<br/>River and Lucy Neal well played, and for serenades, Long
<br/>Time Ago. Played with expression, the music of these three
<br/>pieces is delicious.</p>
         <p>For liveliness and sweetness together, what can surpass,
<br/>Dandy Jim, Jim Along Josey, Lucy Long, or the Old Grey
<br/>Goose, Uncle Gabriel, Walk Along John, It Will Never Do
<br/>To Give It Up So, &amp;c. A few of the songs have a stirring
<br/>chorus, that wakes a man up who inclines to doze over an
<br/>Italian Cadenza. Lastly, are Old Dan Tucker, the Boatmen
<br/>Row, and Coming over the Mountain, (a good thing.)</p>
         <p>We do n’t pretend to enumerate a quarter of the fine airs.
<br/>The only genuine negro songs we have heard, in this city,
<br/>are “Good News, Tena” “Lynchburg Town” and “Walk in
<br/>Heben,” songs to be heard only from the really original band
<br/>of Dan Emmit, who performed at the Chatham Circus last
<br/>season. The other bands, (there are at least ten) contain
<br/>some good, but more indifferent performers who distort broad
<br/>humour into the most extravagant burlesque. The Serena-
<br/>ders at Palmo's sing well and act cleverly, but they sing
<br/>mostly parodies, and not always the genuine music. Every
<br/>museum and public garden has its band. We heard some
<br/>very clever fellows last summer, on board of a steamboa
<br/>that made trips to the fishing banks; and at Hoboken, also.
<br/>In this company was one of the most original violin players
<br/>we ever saw, who held his bow every way, and fiddled in
<br/>a matchless style. Broken down gentlemen, sporting cha-
<br/>racters, and all sorts of people, find their way into these
<br/>associations.</p>
         <p>Many vulgar-minded persons speak of this music as low.
<br/>Such persons (if entitled to judge at all) should disconnect
<br/>the ideas of place and performers, front the music itself. No
<br/>music can be, essentially, degraded, that has in it the ele-
<br/>ments of truth and simplicity. These essential features
<br/>cannot be mistaken, by however humble minstrels sung, or
<br/>to whatever song they may be unhappily married.</p>
         <p>Go then, we advise, ye fanatics per la musica, a few times,
<br/>to hear these minstrels! the places they fill, are worth vis-
<br/>iting occasionally, for the study of character, and the rich in-
<br/>cidents, that sometimes occur in them. Get your wives and
<br/>daughters, or sisters and cousins, to play the airs, repeatedly.
<br/>They will not destroy the taste for pure and fine music;
<br/>though their melody may beget a distaste for the more com-
<br/>plete harmonies of the German Muse.</p>
         <p>Summer is the proper season for hearing this music. It
<br/>accords with the season. You can easily change the scene,
<br/>of a hot evening from the green at Hoboken, or Palmo’s, to a
<br/>southern plantation. You see many from Georgia, the Car-
    <br/>olinas, and Alabama among the audience. Out of doors 
through the open windows you hear negro voices calling
<br/>‘ hot corn’ or ‘I—scream.’ In winter, these adjuncts are
<br/>wanting, and the music sounds spiritless, in consequence.</p>
         <p>The turn for music and dancing in the negro, is wonderful.
<br/>What dancers, what scrapers on the violin, can be made out
<br/>of a fellow who has not three ideas to boast of! The sweeps
<br/>along the streets are vocalists of no mean rank. They sing
<br/>a chaunt, duetts on either side of the way, admirably, and
<br/>whistle to perfection. As to mere time and agility, and
<br/>awkward steps of all kinds gracefully conquered; the negro
    <br/>rivals Fanny Ellsler, on the present idol, Cerito.</p>

   Type of the antique Rome ! Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to Time
By buried centuries of pomp and power!
At length—at length—after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
(Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
I kneel, an alter’d and an humble man,
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur gloom and glory !
Vastness ! and Age ! and Memories of Eld !
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength—
O spells more sure than e’er Judaenn king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars !
Here, where a hero fell, a column fulls!
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
Here, where on golden throne the monarch loll’d,
  Glides, spectre-like unto his marble home,
Lit by the wan-light of the horned moon.
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!
But stay ! these walls—these ivy-clad arcades—
These mould’ring plinths—these sad and blacken’d shafts—
These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze—
These shatter’d cornices—this wreck—this ruin—
These stones—alas ! these gray stones—are they all—
All of the fam’d, and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours, to Fate and me?
“ Not all"—the Echoes answer me—“ not all!
“ Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
"From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
“ As melody from Memnou to the Sun.
“ We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule
“ With a despotic sway all giant minds.
“ We are net impotent—we pallid stones.
" Not all our power is gone—not all our fame—
“ Not all the magic of our high renown—
“ Not all the wonder that encircles us—
“ Not all the mysteries that in us lie—
“ Not all the memories that hung upon
“ And cling around about us as a garment,
“ Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."</div>

         <div class="head">ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT’S “COSMOS.”</div>
         <br/>
         <p>The publication or Alexander von Humboldt’s “ Cosmos,”
<br/>has engaged the attention of the most distinguished public
<br/>writers in Germany. The late number of the “Deutsche
<br/>Schnellpost ’ contains a critick of the work from Berlin, ad-
<br/>dressed to the editor of a newspaper in Cologne.</p>
         <p>The following is a true translation of it.</p>
         <div class="ab">—Ebs. B. J.</div>
         <a href="#p15"/>
         <p>The first volume of Alexander von Humboldt’s “ Cosmos
<br/>Sketches of a Physical Oosmoarapy,” has just been publish-
  <br/>ed, and it is no more than natural that this work should be-
  <br/>come the topic of the conversation of the day, not only among
<br/>the literary classes, but also the educated generally; and, in-
<br/>deed, for this double reason, that the publication of the
<br/>“ Cosmos,” such as Alexander von Humboldt has treated it,
  <br/>is in itself a matter of universal interest, and that this work,
  <br/>besides, has a special relation to the more scientific portion
<br/>of society. When in the years 1827 and 1828, the learned 
<br/>author who has traversed the whole world, delivered public
<br/>lectures on Physical Cosmography alternately in the great
<br/>hall of the singing-academy, and in a lecture-room of the
<br/>university of this city, he was listened to with enthusiastic
<br/>applause. The information which those lectures afforded, is
<br/>yet in fresh memory in Berlin. All that time the lectures 
<br/>were written down by many, and—it may justly be said—
<br/>with passion ; it was also rumoured that they should appear
<br/>in print, which, however, did not ensue. And now these lec-
<br/>tures are presented to us at once from Alexander von Hum-
<br/>boldt’s master-pen, and, even, more of them, and, indeed, 
<br/>something more valuable; for, although the “Cosmos”
<br/>treats on the same subject as those lectures did, and is sub-
<br/>divided just as they were ; yet with the exception of the in-
<br/>troductory words of those lectures (observations on the
<br/>variety of the enjoyment of nature, and a scientific explana-
<br/>tion of the laws of the world), which occupy some 40 and
<br/>odd pages, the whole is written newly, and the work, there-
<br/>fore, contains the latest results of sciences and the last con-
<br/>clusions drawn from them upon the mind and understanding.
<br/>The work is one of the finest and most finished blossoms
<br/>which the cultivation of natural sciences has ever produced.</p>
         <p>To state what and how much it contains would be beyond
<br/>the limits of a newspaper article ; suffice it to say, that the
<br/>work when once finished, as may amply be inferred from the
<br/>first volume, will contain the whole of natural sciences taken
<br/>up from their latest results. The single results of the inves-
<br/>tigation of nature arranged encyclopedically, by no means
<br/>constitute the contents of the work, but only afford a most
<br/>general view. The work exhibits the worth and close con- 
<br/>nexion of all the laws of nature. Astronomy, natural phi-
<br/>losophy, chemistry, natural history and geology, appear by it 
<br/>a living whole. The “ Cosmos” may be likened to a burn-
<br/>ing-glass by which all investigations in natural philosophy
<br/>are reflected on the mind of the reader in a cleared state and
<br/>united in an organic whole.</p>
         <p>The almost infinite combination of experience and facts
<br/>which were to be illustrated for such a great aim and ex-
<br/>hausted in generality, renders the work, written as it is, in 
<br/>the usual style of Alexander von Humboldt, a cheering and
<br/>popular one, and which especially astonishes him who knows
<br/>fully to appreciate the abundance of its contents. Every
<br/>other reader, to whom the information is imparted so easily,
<br/>is far from anticipating its extent, because every thing dev2elops
<br/>itself in such a natural and easy manner. And this would
<br/>prove a test of the value of the work if it were not yet estab-
<br/>lished. The most excellent manner of illustration is, the
<br/>reason why the work is read with such a lively interest, as
<br/>though it were the most interesting volume of polite litera-
<br/>ture.</p>
         <p>It would be most fortunate for our times if such a pheno-
<br/>menon would contribute to advance the taste for the sublime
<br/>in natural sciences. The odious religious controversy which
<br/>now excites and occupies too much society and its external
<br/>organs—the newspapers, would then easily and rapidly ar-
<br/>rive at its end. A. von Humboldt has dedicated the
<br/>“ Cosmos” in profound reverence and with hearty thanks, to
<br/>the King of Prussia.</p>

<br/>has created, seems destined to be an era in the Christian Church, this
<br/>unpretending volume is replete with antiquarian lore, relating to the
<br/>city of Charlemagne, from which the " Pilgrimage ” commences—
<br/>the intermediate historic and poetic ground ; and of the once renowned
<br/>city of Treves, with which it closes. It is the work of a scholar, and

  <br/>WITH A LIFE OF THE CONQUERER, HERNANDO CORTES,

  <br/>BY WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT, Esq.
  <br/>Mr. Prescott appears to possess almost every qualification for his
<br/>task; he has a pure, simple, and eloquent style—a keen relish for the
<br/>picturesque—a quick and discerning judgment of character, and a calm,
<br/>generous and enlightened spirit of philanthropy, There is no exag-
<br/>geration in stating that his “ Conquest of Mexico” contains most of trie
<br/>valuable qualities which distingush the most popular historical writers
<br/>in our language of the present day. It unites the chivalrous but truth-
<br/>ful enthusiasm of Col. Napier, and the vivacity of the accomplished
<br/>author of the " Siege of Granada,” with the patient and ample research
<br/>of Mr. Tytler.—Edinburgh Review, May, 1845.

  <br/>It would be altogether supererogatory to make this celebrated work
<br/>the subject of critical analysis, since it has so long been distinguished
<br/>by the concurrent and enthusiastic applause of the whole reading com-
<br/>munity. We know of scarcely any other work so amusing, instruc-
<br/>tive, and powerfully attractive as the " History of Ferdinand and Isa-
<br/>bella ;” it possesses every charm which elegance of diction, graceful-
<br/>ness of style, and interest of subject can impart. In a word, it is such
<br/>a production as could only have emanated from a mind richly stored
<br/>with the wealth of sound learning, genius, and the felicitous art of its
<br/>application—N. Y. Review.</div>

         <div class="ab"> BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
   <br/>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<br/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<br/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<br/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<br/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<br/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<br/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often
<br/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<br/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<br/>only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<br/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<br/>musicians.
   <br/>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
<br/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
<br/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.
   <br/>The publishers arc in possession of the highest recommendations
<br/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<br/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<br/>of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
<br/>necessary to give a few of the names in the principal cities.
